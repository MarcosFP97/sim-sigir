Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06883-y', 'Headline': 'Online searches to evaluate misinformation can increase its perceived ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, we analysed the search terms for those searching online about the false/misleading article titled: “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to ...', 'Full_text': 'The theory of data voids suggests that, when individuals search online about misinformation, especially misinformation around breaking or recently published news, search engines may return little credible information, instead placing non-credible information at the top of results20. These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'A study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But the government is not planning to implement mask mandates or “lockdowns,” despite claims from the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nFull Story\n\nIn recent weeks, COVID-19 cases, as estimated from wastewater data, and COVID-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise in the U.S. This comes as the omicron variant EG.5, recently designated as a “variant of interest” by the World Health Organization, became the newly dominant variant in the country.\n\nThis has led some public health experts to suggest that some people — especially those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 — wear masks when out in public, and to be a bit more cautious about contracting the coronavirus.\n\nIn a few limited instances, colleges and companies have announced they will be requiring masks for the time being.\n\nBut contrary to many viral social media posts, there is no indication that any kind of government-ordered COVID-19 restrictions are about to begin.\n\nIn an Aug. 18 episode of “The Alex Jones Show,” the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed sources within the federal government told him “new lockdowns are coming.”\n\nSpecifically, he said a “high level manager” in the Transportation Security Administration told him that by mid-September, TSA and airport employees would be required to wear masks due to concerns over “the new variant in Canada.” By mid-October, everyone would have to wear masks on airplanes, he said. He added that the public should expect by December a return to “full COVID protocols.”\n\nJones then claimed that he called a source within Customs and Border Protection after hearing this, and the source allegedly told him to expect “COVID protocols” to begin rolling out in mid-September and to “get ready for a whole new rollout of what happened before.”\n\nThe episode was headlined on Jones’ website InfoWars as “Federal Officials Blow the Whistle on Biden’s Plan for New COVID Lockdowns.”\n\nJones is best known for his false claim that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was fake. Last fall, he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamatory damages to the families of the victims as a result of his falsehoods. Jones is also a prolific spreader of COVID-19 misinformation, among other topics.\n\nClips of Jones’ show began circulating online, and dubious websites such as the Gateway Pundit, which frequently traffics in misinformation, and others reported on the “news,” helping to spread the claims on social media. An associated rallying cry, “do not comply,” briefly trended on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. Others have since repeated the claims.\n\nWhether from Jones or not, the rumor that COVID-19 restrictions might be coming back has since been picked up by some politicians.\n\n“If bureaucrats try to reinstate any COVID tyranny measures, resist them with a vengeance,” tweeted Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Aug. 25. “Do not comply.”\n\nNo Basis for Returning COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nA TSA spokesperson denied Jones’ claims, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — not TSA — is the federal agency responsible for transportation mask requirements.\n\n“TSA is unaware of such a requirement,” the spokesperson told us in an email. “There was no TSA meeting on the topic.”\n\nThe CDC similarly said the claims were untrue. “These rumors are utterly false,” Nick Spinelli, a CDC spokesperson, told us in an email.\n\nMoreover, all the talk of the Biden administration reimposing “lockdowns” is not even legally feasible. “The restrictions that were put into place on businesses, on going to the movie theater, on going to the retail mall … all of those were done by states and local governments, not the federal government,” Wendy E. Parmet, a public health law expert at Northeastern University, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe federal government did advise states on restrictions, including when to lift them, and guided Americans on what they should and should not do to stay safe. But ultimately, these were just suggestions.\n\n“It’s conspiracy thinking and it’s catastrophizing,” Parmet said of Jones’ claims.\n\nParmet added that the restrictions in the U.S., which included business closures and limits on gathering sizes, were not true lockdowns, such as those imposed in China. “The ‘lockdown’ terminology is certainly a misnomer,” she said.\n\nParmet said that legally, TSA probably could impose mask mandates on its employees, but those would not extend to all airport workers or to passengers. That would be a “labor law issue,” she said, and there might be pushback from the union.\n\nThe CDC’s ability to impose a face mask mandate during travel has been contested in court. (Parmet is one of many public health and public health law experts who signed an amicus brief supporting the CDC on this issue.)\n\nThe CDC’s previous order expired due to the end of the public health emergency in May and had already become unenforceable in April 2022 due to a court order.\n\n“I think CDC would be extremely wary, and I suspect that the Biden administration will be exceptionally wary right now … for both litigation and political reasons to go down that route unless they feel it is absolutely essential,” Parmet said.\n\nSpinelli noted that the CDC “continues to recommend that all people—passengers and transportation workers, alike—are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines before they travel and take steps to protect yourself and others.” That can include wearing a mask, if you so choose, when using public transit — but it is not mandated.\n\nThe agency currently advises higher-risk people and their contacts to mask up when a person’s county-level hospital admission level is “medium.” When it’s “high,” everyone is advised to wear a high-quality mask or respirator, such as an N95, and higher-risk people are advised to avoid “non-essential indoor activities in public.” But again, these are just recommendations.\n\nAs of Aug. 12, no counties are listed as “high,” and fewer than 3% are “medium.”\n\nSome experts have criticized tying public health recommendations to hospital admissions, as this is a lagging indicator, and the warning to take more precautions may come too late for many people.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection did not respond to an inquiry about Jones’ claims with any information by the time of publication.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 28: CBP told us the agency follows CDC guidelines and that “[c]laims that CBP has plans to independently reintroduce COVID-19 protocols are false.”\n\nSome Concern from New Variants, But No Expectation of a Return to 2020\n\nScientists and public health officials have been watching two newer coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, variants: EG.5 and BA.2.86.\n\nEG.5, which the CDC estimates made up about a fifth of all coronavirus cases in the U.S. in the past couple of weeks, is a spinoff of XBB.1.9.2, another omicron variant. In this regard, it doesn’t appear to be that different from its immediate predecessors, although it may be a bit more transmissible and more readily able to evade immunity, which could explain its current rise. There isn’t evidence that the variant causes more severe disease.\n\n“Collectively, available evidence does not suggest that EG.5 has additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 descendent lineages,” the WHO concluded in an Aug. 9 risk evaluation report.\n\nAn updated COVID-19 booster, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, is expected to be available in late September or early October. Because EG.5 is quite similar to XBB.1.5, experts anticipate that the updated vaccine will provide good protection against this variant.\n\nThe other variant, BA.2.86, is an omicron descendant, but has many more mutations that make it considerably different. As Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, put it on X, its high number of mutations “makes it an evolutionary jump comparable in size to that which originally gave rise to Omicron.”\n\nOnly a small number of BA.2.86 cases have been identified in the U.S. or elsewhere, but mutation analyses indicate the variant may be especially able to evade immune defenses. It is still too soon to know whether the variant causes more severe disease or is more transmissible, according to the CDC. The variant, however, has been identified in many countries, suggesting it has some ability to spread.\n\nEven if BA.2.86 does turn out to be the next big variant, it would not be the same as 2020, when the entire world was susceptible to the coronavirus, with no kind of prior immunity and no vaccine available.\n\nThe forthcoming updated vaccine may be less effective against BA.2.86 than against other variants, but the CDC expects it will still work to reduce severe disease and hospitalization, which is the primary goal. This makes it highly unlikely that the U.S. would have to impose restrictions similar to those early in the pandemic, even if there is a bad COVID-19 surge and public health officials encourage people to take extra precautions.\n\n“We aren’t returning to March 2020; our immune systems will still recognize the highly mutated variant, albeit suboptimally,” epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina wrote in her Substack about the possible risks of BA.2.86. “This will protect a lot of us from severe disease.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

We define lockdowns as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardised measures for inclusion in the metaanalysis.\n\nThey are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2 per cent. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0 per cent. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7 per cent. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had a negligible effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Herby-Jonung-Hanke meta-analysis found that lockdowns, as reported in studies based on stringency indices in the spring of 2020, reduced mortality by 3.2 per cent when compared to less strict lockdown policies adopted by the likes of Sweden\n\nThis means lockdowns prevented 1,700 deaths in England and Wales, 6,000 deaths across Europe, and 4,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nLockdowns prevented relatively few deaths compared to a typical flu season – in England and Wales, 18,500–24,800 flu deaths occur, in Europe 72,000 flu deaths occur, and in the United States 38,000 flu deaths occur in a typical flu season\n\nThese results pale in comparison to the Imperial College of London’s modelling exercises (March 2020), which predicted that lockdowns would save over 400,000 lives in the United Kingdom and over 2 million lives in the United States\n\nHerby, Jonung, and Hanke conclude that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, played a significant role in mitigating the pandemic – but harsher restrictions, like stay-at-home rules and school closures, generated very high costs but produced only negligible health benefits\n\nCOVID-19 lockdowns were “a global policy failure of gigantic proportions,” according to this peer-reviewed new academic study. The draconian policy failed to significantly reduce deaths while imposing substantial social, cultural, and economic costs.\n\nThe comprehensive 220-page book, began with a systematic review of 19,646 potentially relevant studies. For their meta-analysis, the authors’ screening resulted in the choice of 22 studies that are based on actual, measured mortality data, not on results derived from modelling exercises. A meta-analysis is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for evidence, as it combines comparable, independent studies to determine overall trends.\n\nThe authors, including Professor Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University, also consider a range of studies that determined the impact of individual lockdown restrictions, including stay at-home rules to school closures and travel restrictions.\n\nIn each case, the restrictions did little to reduce COVID-19 mortality:\n\nShelter-in-place (stay at home) orders in Europe and the United States reduced COVID mortality by between 1.4 and 4.1 per cent;\n\nBusiness closures reduced mortality by 7.5 per cent;\n\nGathering limits likely increased COVID mortality by almost six per cent;\n\nMask mandates, which most countries avoided in Spring 2020, reduced mortality by 18.7 per cent, particularly mandates in workplaces; and\n\nSchool closures resulted in a between 2.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent mortality reduction.\n\nA second approach employed by the authors to estimate the effects of lockdowns on mortality combined studies that looked at specific lockdown measures (such as school closures, mask wearing, etc.) on how single non-pharmaceutical interventions were actually used in Europe and the United States. Using this approach, the authors estimate that lockdowns reduced mortality by 10.7 per cent in the spring of 2020 – significantly less than estimates produced by epidemiological modelling.\n\nThe study compares the effect of lockdown measures against the effect of ‘doing the least,’ rather than doing nothing at all. Sweden’s response to COVID was among the least stringent in Europe, but still imposed some legal restrictions and included an extensive public information campaign.\n\nYou can read the press release for the book here.\n\nFullscreen Mode'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/22/facebook-posts/fauci-didnt-say-lockdowns-are-useful-forcing-vacci/', 'Headline': ""Fauci's comment about lockdowns, vaccination twisted out of context"", 'Snippet': 'Our ruling.

At the 6:54 mark in the video, Mitchell asked, ""How concerning is the outbreak in China?"" and mentioned the ongoing, near-total lockdown in Shanghai.\n\nPart of Fauci’s reply was, ""You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won\'t have a surge of infections, because you\'re dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they\'ve not really been exposed because of the lockdown.""\n\nHe went on to say, around the 8:25 mark, that people in China are not well-protected by vaccines — in part because China is using less effective vaccines than many other countries — and that its most vulnerable population, older people, are not vaccinated.\n\nHis observations about vaccinations in China are borne out by recent reporting.\n\nChina ""is struggling with two problems as it faces its worst COVID-19 surge since the start of the pandemic,"" according to an April 20 story in the Financial Times. The problems are ""the sluggish take-up of booster doses — authorities said this week that only 57 per cent of people over 60 have been fully vaccinated with three jabs — and homegrown vaccines that are much less effective than foreign-produced jabs.""\n\nBut the first portion of Fauci’s comment — that ""you use lockdowns to get people vaccinated"" — was seized upon by people such as Dr. Simone Gold, a founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, which became famous for voicing coronavirus conspiracy theories.\n\nGold tweeted on April 19, ""Fauci is essentially admitting that lockdowns were used to condition and control the public—putting people in such a heightened state of desperation for freedom as to compel us to take the vaccine.""\n\nThe story that the Facebook post references, from the Daily Wire, gives a more complete accounting of Fauci’s comments, but it also gives the misleading impression that Fauci is a supporter of China’s style of lockdowns.\n\nFor example, the story quotes a fragment of one of Fauci’s comments — that China’s type of strict lockdowns would never be able to be implemented in the United States, ""although that prevents the spread of infection"" — even though Fauci never said or implied that the U.S. should employ those types of lockdowns.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post suggests that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nThe claim includes a truncated version of Fauci’s comments that was taken out of context.\n\nIn his 90-second reply, he talked specifically about vaccine efficacy and uptake in China, where there is an ongoing lockdown.\n\nAnd Fauci did not indicate at any point that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://record.umich.edu/articles/lockdowns-saved-lives-but-not-a-go-to-strategy-moving-forward/', 'Headline': 'Lockdowns saved lives, but not a go-to strategy moving forward', 'Snippet': 'A new University of Michigan-led study shows the lockdowns implemented in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic saved lives — but the decision to use lockdowns is much more nuanced and the research shouldn’t be used to justify lockdowns now or to retroactively endorse that approach, said health economist Olga Yakusheva, associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing.', 'Full_text': 'The U.S. pandemic lockdown in 2020 caused a $2.3 trillion economic downturn and split the nation politically, and now some European nations are locking down again as omicron surges through the global population.\n\nBut do these drastic measures save lives?

A quality adjusted life year is one year of life in perfect health.\n\nThe study, published in PLOS One, should not be used to justify more lockdown measures, Yakusheva said. Nor is it a retroactive endorsement of the strict economic lockdown approach the United States imposed during the first six months of the pandemic.\n\n“We evaluated the full packet of public health measures as it was implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but lesser mitigation measures may have worked just as well to reduce lives lost,” Yakusheva said. “The fact is, we just will never know. At the time, we had to work with the information that we had. We knew the pandemic was deadly, and we did not have therapeutics or a vaccine.”\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since the pandemic began, and we have more tools to battle the virus, Yakusheva said. Vaccines and therapeutics are available, as are other mitigation measures.\n\nThis is the first known paper to measure the effect of pandemic lockdown mitigation measures on lives saved and lost, as opposed to typical economic evaluations, which examine the cost per life saved, she said.\n\n“This is tough for people to agree upon. Typically, people are in one of two camps — pragmatics who worry about the economy and ethicists who say any amount of money is worth saving a life,” Yakusheva said. “Some value loved ones more, or their own lives. It’s very subjective.\n\n“What we did was look at empirical correlations between loss of income and mortality, and created a range of estimates on how many people could be expected to die as a result of the downturn, which is essentially the estimated collateral damage of the public health measures. What our analysis did was to allow us an apples-to-apples comparison of lives saved vs. lives lost.”\n\nThere are important study limitations. Chief among them are that some answers to major questions were unobserved — for instance, how many lives would have been lost had COVID-19 been unmitigated. In other words, if it had just run its course with no public health measures in place.\n\n“We know how many people died with public health measures in place, but we can’t know how many people would have died without those measures in place,” Yakusheva said.\n\nThe team estimated that number based on published literature, and the accuracy of that literature, or the public’s behavior, could lead to an over or underestimate.\n\nAlso, all of the human toll of the lockdown won’t be seen immediately. For example, the health toll could manifest later as disease progression because someone who was unemployed couldn’t buy medications.\n\n“We tried to be very careful and produced a range of numbers of lives potentially saved and lost, and we hope the true numbers lie within those ranges,” Yakusheva said.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/why-did-jurisdictions-repeatedly-use-inefficient-lockdowns-during-the-covid-19-pandemic', 'Headline': 'Why Did Jurisdictions Repeatedly Use Inefficient Lockdowns During the ...', 'Snippet': 'Economic Freedom of the World.

During this time politicians, policy analysts, scientists, and public health officials learned a considerable amount about the nature of the virus and the efficacy of lockdown policies. They understood very early on that the virus would not be as lethal as predicted, and by the fall of 2020 they knew that the lockdown policy had only marginal and short-run benefits for public health.\n\nDespite the surge of COVID-19 information, including the knowledge that generally speaking only a particular small subset of the population was especially vulnerable, government officials and politicians made no significant change to the lockdown policy. The same ineffective but extremely costly policies were repeated over and over. Furthermore, the enforcement of lockdown policies increased over time despite the overall decline in the lethalness of the virus and the increased abilities to treat it.\n\nI argue that this behaviour was the result of a “double down” political equilibrium. For various reasons, governments around the world panicked in February and March of 2020 and concluded that only a severe lockdown could isolate the virus and stop it from spreading. They quickly became aware of the failure and cost of this action and were faced with a choice: they could admit their terrible mistake or double down, continue with the policy, and hope that an endemic state would come soon. When a second wave of the virus returned in the fall of 2020, the dominant strategy of those jurisdictions that had earlier locked down was to repeat their lockdown policy. This strategy continued until the widespread infections caused by the Omicron variant led to an endemic state and allowed for a declaration of lockdown victory.\n\nThe double-down strategy required political support, and this came mostly from two sources: the “laptop class” and other winners from the lockdown; and those terrified enough by the virus that they believed lockdowns were justified. This explains three observations over the first two years of the pandemic. First, the response to COVID-19 has led to large increases in economic inequality. Increased inequality means that the relative positions of those at the top have increased, giving this group more power in the competition for goods and services. Second, there was, from the beginning, a massive campaign of fear-mongering that created false assessments of the actual risk of the virus by the general population. Third, the enforcement of lockdowns and other mandates increased over time.\n\nThe Omicron variant did two things. First, it entered the homes of a large fraction of the population and demonstrated the actual risk of the virus at that stage of the pandemic. This led to protests and rebellions as the truth became disseminated. Second, by infecting so many it allowed States to declare that the virus had become endemic. Thus, despite a sixth wave from the BA.2 variant lockdowns came to an end.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.acsh.org/news/2022/09/21/did-covid-lockdowns-work-16563', 'Headline': 'Did COVID Lockdowns Work? - American Council on Science and Health', 'Snippet': ""Lockdowns that were initiated early and that were strictly enforced seemed to save lives.

This makes both common and scientific sense as the closer our contact with one another, the more likely we are to transmit the virus to one another through our exhalations. Lockdowns with quarantining of infected individuals are the most effective means we have of distancing individuals. But as Mr. Berra points out, the practical application determines how much of the theoretical impact occurs.\n\nLockdowns that were initiated early and that were strictly enforced seemed to save lives. Nowhere have lockdowns been more prompt and draconian than in China. Johns Hopkins reports that China\'s cases per 100,000 are 1.6, and in the US, 318/100,000. Of course, the problem with initiating a lockdown early is that your fears may not be well founded. Early lockdowns risk “crying wolf” when the infectious threat is not as significant as initially perceived. Remember how much higher R0 was at the beginning of the pandemic, as the virus worked through the frail in our nursing homes?\n\nHuman behavior\n\n“There’s a fundamental difficulty with analyzing the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns: it is hard to know what would have happened in their absence.”\n\nFrom the viewpoint of scientific inquiry, without a control group, it is challenging to project how many lives were saved by lockdowns – although that difficulty has not kept researchers from making those estimates. The first difficulty is that lockdown meant different measures in each country. The second and more intractable problem is our human response to the pandemic and public health guidance and mandates. Those who perceived themselves as most at risk didn’t wait for government guidance; as the Florida data on cell-phone measured movement confirms, the concerned stayed home weeks before any State imperatives. Lockdowns, by that measure, have less effect.\n\nOne of the other findings was that similar lockdowns applied in different countries (a marker of cultural differences) had very different impacts. Consider Peru, which employed early and strict measures. Despite their efforts, they experience 655 deaths per 100,000 population, the highest of any country. While, in part, due to an expensive and inadequate health system, its “large informal workforce” continued to shop and work, making enforcement difficult and blunting the efficacy of lockdowns on transmission. In a country as culturally diverse as the US, local human behavior may have just as easily mitigated the effectiveness of lockdowns as the stay-at-home early adopters.\n\nThe accompanying graphic shows that the most effective lockdowns involved small and large groups.\n\n“This pandemic was crying out for [a] precision public-health response because the risks associated with the public-health threat with the virus were so focused on a small minority, and the harms done by things like lockdown were not focused on the same people.”\n\n- Mark Woolhouse, epidemiologist University of Edinburgh\n\nThis raises the fundamental issue of whether lockdowns could have been more targeted to at-risk populations. Again, early in the pandemic, it was easy to make a case to lockdown nursing homes, the frail and the elderly. Of course, that alone was insufficient because those individuals require care and caregivers. Effective isolation of the at-risk requires us to lock down their caregivers and the caregiver’s families – all chinks in the lockdown armor.\n\nA far greater debate has surrounded the lockdowns of schools. Again, early in the pandemic, there was no data on the impact of COVID on children; historically, children and the frail elderly are the most at-risk. Coupled with the very human desire to protect “our children,” it is not surprising that lockdowns included schools. While there was some evidence that older children, mid-teens and older, experienced COVID more like adults, there was a paucity of early data on the impact on younger children. Rather than a strategic lockdown of college or high school, all education was shut down. Even our late in the pandemic strategery of identifying at-risk neighborhoods was contentious – were cases, hospitalizations, or deaths the best or even accurate measure of risk?\n\n“Pure economic analyses of whether lockdowns were worth it generally try to estimate the value of lives saved and compare that with the costs of economic downturns. But there is no consensus on how to make this comparison.”\n\nLockdowns come with costs; economic, social, educational, and psychological – all difficult to quantify. When we compare those costs to the efficacy of lockdowns, when we consider the tradeoff, any number of biases influence our findings. Despite the efforts by researchers to put a value on lives lost and economic disruptions, those seemingly objective dollar values are, in fact, subjective. Economic and social costs are less weighty when we believe every life is precious. When we think that the disruption of our day-to-day lives contributes to our well-being, the balance may tip in the other direction. These are ethical, subjective choices. Using the refrain, “follow the science,” as the explanation belittles the role of science and makes public health decisions less transparent and accountable.\n\n“[the public needs to know more about how pandemic- control policies are decided]“That makes public-health policymaking seem less capricious because it’s reactive to both the science and values.”\n\n- Thomas Tsai, MD T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nThere it is, a reminder that regulatory policy, guidelines, mandates, and the acceptance and push-back they engender are human enterprises. The difficulty in disentangling our facts from our beliefs is part of being human. A little humility from both our public officials and their opponents is in order.'}}",100.0,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure.

The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe.

Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data.

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for November 26. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[524][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[525][529]\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[530][531] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[532] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[533] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[534]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[535] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][536] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[537] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[538] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[539] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[540] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[541][542]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[543] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[544][545] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[546] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[545]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19, likely putting the sentencing date at risk as well.[547]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][536] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[548][549][550]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[550] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[548] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[550]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[551] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[552][553] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[554] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[541] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[555][556]\n\nFirearms and liquor licenses\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[557] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[558] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[559] [560] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[561] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[562][563]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[564] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[564][565][566] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[564][567] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[568][564]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[569][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[570]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week.

Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day ...', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe former president was not giving evidence - instead, he stopped just outside the courtroom to address reporters before the historic hearing began.\n\nAfter a few stern looks at the camera, he launched into a lengthy preview of what his lawyers are expected to argue during the civil case again him, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization.\n\nHe also lobbed accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud charges and is seeking a fine of $250m (£207m), and Judge Arthur Engoron who already ruled last week that Mr Trump and his business had committed fraud.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at seven of Mr Trump\'s claims.\n\n1. There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/trump-civil-fraud-trial-witness-list-new-york/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump and his adult children are listed as potential witnesses ...', 'Snippet': 'The former president is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York attorney general and Trump’s legal team.

Most of the witnesses have also testified in videotaped depositions.\n\nIn civil cases, defendants can be called to testify and if they refuse, the jury, or in this case Judge Arthur Engoron, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nThe case is scheduled to start Monday. Engoron will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state after finding the former president and his business engaged in a persistent fraud by using inflated financial statements for nearly a decade.\n\nThe state is also seeking to prove the Trumps engaged in insurance fraud and falsified business records. Engoron has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nAn appeals court ruling is expected as soon as Thursday that could potentially impact the trial start date.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217973766/trump-witness-claims-no-evidence-of-fraud-in-civil-case', 'Headline': 'Trump witness claims no evidence of fraud in civil case : NPR', 'Snippet': ""Trump's lawyers called, as their penultimate witness, Dr. Eli Bartov, a highly credentialed accounting professor from New York University who had once served as an expert witness for the New York ..."", 'Full_text': 'AILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nDonald Trump looked on today as an expert witness bolstered a key element of the former president\'s defense. The witness said categorically that he found no evidence of accounting fraud in Trump\'s books. And he admonished the New York attorney general\'s office for, quote, ""making up allegations."" NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein was there and joins us now. Hey, Andrea.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: OK, so it sounds like Trump got some backup for his defense today.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes. Trump\'s lawyers called, as their penultimate witness, Dr. Eli Bartov, a highly credentialed accounting professor from New York University who had once served as an expert witness for the New York attorney general\'s office.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter) OK.\n\nBERNSTEIN: And Bartov just jumped right in saying, quote, ""there is no evidence whatsoever for accounting fraud."" He sounded like a classroom professor, repeating phrases and saying things like parts of the attorney general\'s complaint, quote, ""border on the absurd"" and that, quote, ""no valuations are objective because they are, by definition, opinions."" He added, if somebody tells you an evaluation is objective, they need to have their head examined. And the witness said that a disclaimer in Trump\'s statements of financial condition makes it clear that no one should take them at face value, and this was so obvious even his 9-year-old granddaughter could understand.\n\nCHANG: Interesting testimony. OK, so how did the AG\'s office respond to all of that?\n\nBERNSTEIN: They really wanted to make it clear that Professor Bartov is not an expert in banking or real estate valuations. At one point, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace objected saying, quote, ""this is pure speculation from somebody they hired to say whatever they want,"" at which point Bartov turned to Wallace and said, quote, ""you should be ashamed. You make up allegations, and you say I say whatever I want. You should be ashamed of yourself talking to me like that,"" which is, of course, highly unusual...\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nBERNSTEIN: ...For a witness. This was right before lunch. And I did catch Trump lawyer Alina Habba smiling as she turned to leave.\n\nCHANG: And am I understanding this correctly? Trump stayed all day to hear this witness.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes, even though it got quite repetitive. Trump knows that when he\'s in the courtroom, we, the press, are there. And we heard Professor Bartov saying the kinds of things that Trump likes to say like, I\'ve never seen a financial statement that provided so much detail. And then, of course, there are all those TV cameras out in the hallway capturing Donald Trump\'s words when he leaves and when he says things like, he should be in Iowa campaigning. Now, of course, he could be in Iowa. He is here fully by his own choice.\n\nCHANG: So what\'s next for Trump in this trial?\n\nBERNSTEIN: So in action outside of this courtroom, Trump got some relief today when an appeals court panel affirmed a judge\'s decision from earlier this fall that the dissolution of Trump\'s business would remain on hold until this trial is over. You might remember that before the trial even began, the judge found on one cause of action for the attorney general and said that Trump would have to start canceling his business certificates. But that was paused.\n\nAnd Trump has also lost his efforts, so far, to overturn a gag order that prevents him from disparaging the judge\'s clerk. Trump\'s lawyers had complained that this violated Trump\'s First Amendment rights, but both the trial judge and an appeals panel have ruled otherwise, which means when Trump testifies on Monday, he won\'t be able to go after the judge\'s clerk from the witness stand. That\'ll be the last day of the defense case - after that, a day of rebuttal, followed by briefs and final arguments in court in January; sometime mid-next-month, maybe just before or after the Iowa caucuses, a verdict.\n\nCHANG: A lot coming up.

Last month, James’s lawyers called Trump as a witness for the prosecution. On the stand ...', 'Full_text': 'Courtroom 300 at the New York County Courthouse was quiet on Monday following Donald Trump’s last-minute decision not to testify again in his civil trial on charges of business fraud. The proceeding, which began in early October, is now approaching an end. Trump’s lawyers are wrapping up the defense’s case. They had been scheduled to call him as their final witness—one of them had said last week that he wanted to testify—but, on Sunday, Trump announced on his social-media site that he wouldn’t be showing up. “I have already testified to everything & have nothing more to say other than this is a complete & total election interference (Biden campaign!) witch hunt,” he wrote.\n\nOf course, the Biden Administration has nothing to do with this case, which is being brought by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James. Last month, James’s lawyers called Trump as a witness for the prosecution. On the stand, he tried to dismiss the significance of his inflated statements of net worth, which are at the heart of the case. If he had testified again on Monday, it would have given him another chance to defend himself and take some more potshots at James and Judge Arthur F. Engoron, who is presiding over a bench case with no jury. But it would also have given the prosecutors a second crack at him, on cross-examination.\n\nEvidently, Trump’s lawyers persuaded their client to bow out—and for good reason. As Lisa Rubin, a legal analyst for MSNBC, pointed out in a blog post on Monday, Trump “has never been a reliable or helpful witness in his own defense.” I was at the courthouse for his testimony last month, and, although his lawyers publicly praised his combative performance, it didn’t help their legal case. Trump admitted that he went over some of the figures in his company’s statements of net worth with Allen Weisselberg, the then chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and suggested adjustments to some of them. He also conceded that some of the documents for the Trump Organization’s loans from Deutsche Bank required the company to maintain accurate financial statements. And he gave a misleading account of the laughable efforts to inflate the value of his triplex at Trump Tower.\n\nTrump’s tendency to gab meant that minimizing his time on the witness stand was a no-brainer. It’s a strategy that his lawyers are likely to mimic when the four criminal cases against him go to trial. Two of these cases—one involving a federal indictment in Washington, D.C., another at the state level in Fulton County, Georgia—arose from Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. There is another federal case, in Florida, which involves charges that he mishandled classified information and attempted to obstruct justice. In the fourth case, brought by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, Trump faces criminal charges of falsifying business records arising from the surreptitious payoff he made in 2016 to the adult-film star Stormy Daniels. Given the potential ramifications of these cases, which include Trump being found guilty and sentenced to prison, the New York civil case has always been something of an afterthought. But even though this case is largely about money—the prosecutors are asking the court to ban Trump and his sons from doing business in New York and to issue a fine of up to two hundred and fifty million dollars—it has certainly got under Trump’s skin and provided some suggestions of how the criminal trials are likely to play out.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have followed a strategy that involves a division of labor. In the courtroom, the Trump team, led by Chris Kise, a former Florida solicitor general, has had the resources and wherewithal to launch a lengthy and expansive legal defense. Simultaneously, and mostly from outside the courtroom, Trump has mounted a sustained campaign of vilification against the prosecutors, the courts, the Biden Administration, and the very idea that he should be held accountable for anything.\n\nConfronted with a mountain of documentary evidence relating to the bogus statements of net worth, Trump’s lawyers have largely avoided that incriminating record and sought to undermine the legal basis of the attorney general’s case. To this end, they have called on a number of expert witnesses. Last Thursday, Eli Bartov, a professor of accounting at N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business, told the court, “I’ve never seen a statement that provides so much detail and is so transparent as these statements.” On Friday, Bartov revealed that he had been paid nearly nine hundred thousand dollars for testifying, with some of the money coming from the Trump Organization and the rest from Trump’s Save America PAC. With MAGA campaign donors footing the bill, Trump can apparently afford the best testimony money can buy.\n\nThe Trump lawyers have also appealed some of Engoron’s rulings, including one in which he ruled, pretrial, that in preparing the bogus financial statements and submitting them to various financial institutions, Trump and the Trump Organization violated a New York fraud statute. (The case is now largely about putative penalties and efforts by the Trump lawyers to create grounds for an appeal.) More recently, Kise and his colleagues have asked a higher court to overturn a gag order that Engoron issued, which prohibited Trump from publicly commenting on the court staff, including one of the judge’s law clerks, whom Trump had attacked personally in a social-media post.\n\nEven though these appeals haven’t succeeded, Trump’s lawyers in the criminal cases are already following the same strategy of appealing virtually everything, including the Justice Department’s authority to press charges against him relating to his conduct in office. This is partly a delay tactic—Trump would dearly love to push back the criminal trials until after the 2024 election, a fact the prosecutors are well aware of. In what looked like an effort to expedite the appeals process, the special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the federal elections charges against Trump, asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether the former President has immunity from prosecution, and the high court agreed to fast-track its consideration of whether to hear the case.\n\nSmith’s move and the Supreme Court’s response are potentially a blow to the Trump team’s efforts to push the Washington trial back from its scheduled start date in March. Even if they lose that one, though, Trump’s lawyers will doubtless continue with their efforts to facilitate his attacks on the prosecutors and the courts. On Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled on a request from Trump’s lawyers to overturn a gag order issued by Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the federal elections case. The appeals court left in place those parts of the ruling in which Chutkan ordered Trump not to make public comments on any member of the court staff or anyone working with Smith, but the appeals court struck down another important element of Chutkan’s ruling, which prohibited Trump from attacking Smith himself.\n\nAs the trial date approaches, Trump will doubtless take advantage of Friday’s ruling, which the D.C. appeals court described as an effort to balance his right to free speech with the need to protect the integrity of the legal system. In all probability, he will now step up his attacks on Smith, whom he has already described as “deranged,” “a thug,” and a “fully weaponized monster.” (If Trump sees the irony of a system that he is vilifying going out of its way to make sure his constitutional rights are protected, he hasn’t acknowledged it.) But one thing Trump seems unlikely to do, at any stage, is step back into a witness-box, where Smith’s team could confront him with detailed evidence of his efforts to overturn the election, and, quite likely, elicit some self-incriminating statements. Trump is sometimes his own worst enemy, and his lawyers know it. ♦'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-jr-fraud-trial-testifying-defense-witness/', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump Jr. returns to witness stand as New York fraud trial ...', 'Snippet': ""She pointed to Trump Jr.'s assertion that the building at 40 Wall St. in New York has a 90% occupancy rate.

New York Attorney General Letitia James\' office rested the state\'s case last week, giving defense attorneys their chance to call their own witnesses for the first time.\n\nIn addition to being the former president\'s son, Trump Jr. is a top executive at the Trump Organization. He previously testified in the trial earlier this month, when James\' office called him to the stand to face questions about financial statements at the heart of the case. He returned as a witness for the defense on Monday.\n\n""I\'d say it\'s good to be here, Your Honor, but I\'m afraid the attorney general would sue me for perjury,"" Trump Jr. said at one point.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\'s testimony\n\nIn his early testimony Monday, Trump Jr. touted the family company and what he called his father\'s ""genius."" Responding to prompts from a lengthy slideshow presented by the defense team, Trump Jr. discussed the Trump Organization\'s history and many of the properties Donald Trump has bought or developed.\n\n""He\'s an artist with real estate,"" Trump Jr. said of his father, later adding, ""That is his canvas that he creates. He is a creative guy, and he\'s also good at building.""\n\nTrump Jr. repeatedly invoked the ""artist"" label for his father, saying he turned ""eyesores"" into ""jewels."" On multiple occasions, he cited what he said was his father\'s unusual ""vision"" toward projects.\n\nLawyers for the state objected to the defense\'s presentation, which included dozens of slides, but New York Judge Arthur Engoron rejected their effort. ""I think it is relevant to get the historical perspective. I want no further objections on that,"" the judge said.\n\nEarlier in the case, and during pretrial hearings, attorneys for the Trumps sought to explain seemingly inflated valuations as a product of Donald Trump\'s ""extraordinary"" real estate vision. They said his valuations were ultimately shown to be accurate as properties grew in value. Trump Jr. offered up a similar explanation Monday.\n\n""My father was on the leading edge of creating"" value, Trump Jr. said.\n\nHe described a series of properties that he said were in disrepair when Trump bought them, saying his father ""saw the potential"" in them. The judge in the case has previously rejected an argument put forward by the defense that Trump\'s inflated valuations were justified because the properties later became more valuable.\n\nAs in Trump Jr.\'s previous appearance during the testimony, he joked frequently, stopping to comment on the court sketch artist\'s work and remarking on the stand about photos of himself and brother Eric Trump.\n\n""I would have so much fun with that picture, but I will refrain. A lot of Photoshop,"" he said at one point, when Eric Trump was shown on the screen, about 70 slides in.\n\nJames\' team objected to an exhibit entered by Trump Jr.\'s attorney, Clifford Robert — a valuation of Trump\'s Doral Club in Florida completed by the real estate firm Newmark in 2022. The company told the Trumps the property was worth $1.3 billion, far higher than the attorney general believes it was worth between 2011 and 2021, the years in question at trial.\n\nOne lawyer for James\' office called the document ""a draft marketing brochure."" Another called it ""stupid."" The judge said it was ""irrelevant"" to the case, but allowed it to be entered into evidence.\n\nRobert said there would be more testimony on the document to come.\n\n""We\'re actually going to hear testimony tomorrow that [a Newmark employee] thinks [the valuation] is too low,"" Robert said.\n\nTrump Jr. ultimately walked the court through more than 100 slides during the defense\'s questioning, explaining how he believes the Trump Organization improved various properties and made them more valuable.\n\nOnce the defense was finished, Colleen Faherty, a lawyer for James, questioned Trump Jr. very briefly, highlighting several instances that might contrast with elements of his testimony.\n\nShe pointed to Trump Jr.\'s assertion that the building at 40 Wall St. in New York has a 90% occupancy rate. Faherty pulled up a recent news article listing it at 77%, down from 98% in 2015.\n\n""Isn\'t it true that 40 Wall St. was just placed on the servicer\'s watch list?"" she asked, citing an article which said the family\'s loan on the building had been transferred to a special servicer.\n\n""I don\'t know that for sure,"" Trump Jr. replied.\n\nFaherty concluded her questioning by pointing to another article about a Trump-branded hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii. The owner is buying out the Trumps\' management contract, and converting the property into a Hilton.\n\n""Is it correct that it is ditching the Trump name?"" she asked.\n\nTrump Jr. insisted that the move was a win for the Trumps. ""If they want to buy it out for millions of dollars, I\'m OK with that,"" he said.\n\nTrump Jr.\'s earlier testimony\n\nTrump Jr. was previously called to the stand on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3, when he testified that he relied on the Trump Organization\'s accountants to prepare the so-called statements of financial condition detailing his father\'s assets.\n\nThe defense did not question Trump Jr. at the time. His siblings Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump, and father, former President Donald Trump, were also called to the stand after Trump Jr.\'s first appearance.\n\nOn Monday, a defense attorney indicated they will call Eric Trump back to the stand later in the trial, which is expected to last through mid-December.\n\nThe younger Trumps downplayed their roles in preparing the financial statements. Engoron concluded in a pretrial ruling in September that the documents fraudulently overstated Donald Trump\'s wealth by billions of dollars, and the value of certain properties by hundreds of millions of dollars. James\' office is arguing that doing so allowed his family and company to cut deals with banks and insurers for significantly better terms than the Trumps otherwise would have received.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants have all denied wrongdoing. The trial is proceeding on other allegations in the state\'s civil suit, including falsification of business records and conspiracy. The judge is also being asked to determine ""disgorgement,"" or the amount the state should receive for ""ill-gotten"" gains.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/02/donald-trump-trial-begins-in-new-york-over-potential-real-estate-fraud/71030426007/', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump real estate fraud case begins in New York: recap - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': 'New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York.

Legal experts warned on Monday that because the judge in the case will decide Trump\'s fate, not a jury, it could enter complicated territory. The case will likely focus on financial disclosures and other specific legal questions.\n\nThe trial is also expected to stretch on for months as prosecutors seek to prove that the former president and the Trump Organization committed fraud across Trump\'s real estate empire.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump team vilifies judge\n\nTrump and his allies have targeted the judge in the civil case, Judge Arthur Engoron, in messages on social media and in public statements. Most of the attacks have focused on Engoron’s surprised reaction to being filmed before the trial started. He did allow television cameras and photographers into the courtroom briefly Monday morning.\n\nIt\'s not the first time Trump has hit out at legal officials involved in his criminal and civil trials. He has often targeted the judges and prosecutors in his four criminal indictments handed down this year. His criticisms have ranged from calling on officials to recuse themselves to personal attacks about the individuals themselves.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nFirst witness takes the stand in Trump\'s fraud case\n\nDonald Bender, the New York attorney general’s first witness in the case, was Trump\'s accountant at Mazars USA, an accounting firm.\n\nBender testified that he previously compiled financial statements for the Trump Organization, a clarification meaning that he didn\'t necessarily analyze the information, just assembled it, CNN reported.\n\n“If I saw something that didn’t make sense to me, or bothered me, I would ask (a client) about it,” Bender testified.\n\nWhile Trump\'s attorneys objected to some documents from Mazars, Judge Arthur Engoron overruled the effort as he weighs the evidence against the former president.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCourt is back in session: Key moments from the morning\n\nOpening statements have concluded in the New York trial of the former president, who has been accused of pumping up his net worth to get a better deal on loans.\n\nTrump is back in the courtroom, seated with his defense attorneys.

That doesn\'t necessarily mean they\'ll testify, but they could be called to answer questions before the court.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump attorneys take aim at Michael Cohen\n\nMultiple lawyers for the former president and his employees criticized Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\'s former attorney, during the trial on Monday.\n\nClifford Robert, an attorney speaking on behalf of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., argued that Cohen isn\'t a reliable source for information about the Trump Organization.\n\n“When you talk about credibility, you’re going to have a guy who lies to everyone, who is a convicted felon,” Robert said, according tomultiple reports.\n\nCohen was sentenced to prison in December 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, in addition to other crimes.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump: ‘Rigged court’ wrong about Mar-a-Lago value\n\nWaving paper in the air during a lunch break in the trial, Trump quoted a statement from Palm Beach County officials challenging the judge’s interpretation of the value of the Mar-a-Lago and said the fraud ruling should be overturned.\n\n“This is a rigged court,” Trump said of the judge, who he argued should be disbarred and driven from office.\n\nHe said anyone who does business in New York State is “crazy” because of the potential for adverse rulings such as his. “This guy’s getting away with murder,” Trump said of the judge.\n\nAsked why he attended the trial in person, Trump said, “I wanted to watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nWill Trump testify in the case?\n\nThe former president isn\'t expected to testify for several weeks at least.\n\nBut he has given a peek into how he might try to defend himself: Trump has argued that New York Attorney General and other officials are undervaluing some of his assets, such as Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort.\n\nOther people in Trump\'s orbit are also expected to testify, including his two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, Trump Organization employees and more. Trump\'s former attorney Michael Cohen, who is now a vocal critic of the former president, is also a potential witness.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nWho is the judge at Trump’s trial, Arthur Engoron?\n\nThe New York judge presiding over Trump’s civil fraud trial, Arthur Engoron, drove a taxi while in college, played in a band while working as a litigator and law clerk, and protested the Vietnam War.\n\nHis biography often plays into humorous asides in his written decisions. Engoron peppers his rulings with quotes from Bob Dylan and Shakespeare and movies like “City Slickers” and the Marx Brothers classic “Duck Soup.”\n\nNow Engoron deciding how to penalize Trump, after ruling he committed fraud for years while building his real estate empire. Engoron is a few years younger than Trump and spent his early hears in Queens, New York, about four miles from Trump’s childhood home.\n\nTrump, who is listed as a potential witness and could end up face-to-face with Engoron in court, called the judge\'s fraud ruling “the corporate death penalty.” He referred to Engoron as a “political hack"" and said his would appeal.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nWhat\'s at stake in Trump\'s fraud case?\n\nWhat could happen to the former president and his company if he loses this case? New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York.\n\nBut a ruling against Trump, if upheld in court, could force the former president to give up a slate of high-profile properties in New York, including Trump Tower, a Wall Street office building, golf courses and a suburban estate.\n\nTrump has called the potential punishments ""a corporate death penalty.""\n\n– Associated Press\n\nWhat time is Trump\'s trial today?\n\nTrump\'s trial began at 10 a.m. ET and end at 4:30 p.m.. This is the schedule every day except Fridays, when the trial adjourns at 1 p.m. so the judge can focus on other court business.\n\nThe trial is expected to last three months.\n\n– Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nAnother New York trial is still ahead for Trump\n\nTrump has a busy calendar ahead for potential courtroom appearances. This is not his only civil case.\n\nTrump is scheduled to go to trial again in January in a defamation lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll. The Justice Department earlier this year said the former president is not immune from a second defamation suit from Carroll that is pending against him over comments he made about her during his presidency. A jury had found Trump liable in a civil case for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and defamation.\n\nTrump is also facing criminal charges in separate indictments in DC, Georgia, and Florida\n\n– Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nTrump, allies shown in videos during opening statements\n\nThe New York attorney general\'s office played several depositions in the courtroom on Monday, featuring Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Donald Trump speaking about financial statements, corporate accounting and more.\n\nDuring Trump\'s deposition, he was asked whether Allen Weisselberg, his former longtime chief financial officer, was responsible for a slate of financial statements,.\n\n""I would say yes,"" Trump said.\n\nAttorneys also played a deposition from Trump\'s former attorney, Michael Cohen, about documents he said he was involved in preparing before the former president\'s first term in the White House. Cohen claimed Trump wanted to be ranked higher on lists created by Forbes and accused Weisselberg of inflating assets to reach that goal.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump\'s lawyers say he told the truth\n\nDefense lawyer Christopher Kise in his opening statement told the court that Donald Trump\'s financial statements were true, pointing to Trump’s decades-long business career.\n\n“He has made a fortune, literally, being right about real estate investments,” Kise said.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nTrump\'s opponents: \'Someone is rattled\'\n\nDonald Trump\'s opponents have a different take on his appearance in court today - he\'s scared and getting desperate.\n\n""Middle of the night rant against the judge and \'Racist\' AG (He only calls black people \'racist\') hours before his appearance in court,"" the organization Republicans Against Trump said on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter. ""Someone is rattled.""\n\nThe Lincoln Project, another anti-Trump political organization, put out a digital ad saying Trump knows he is ""broke and busted."" Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, said “Trump’s empire of lies is collapsing"" and his ""organization is being taken away from him.""\n\nWilson added: ""This loser is facing the pressure now and there’s no one he can look to for help.“\n\n– David Jackson\n\nOpening arguments against Trump\n\nThis civil case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James accuses Trump and his company of tricking banks, insurers and others by repeatedly lying about his wealth.\n\n“They were lying year after year after year,” Kevin Wallace, a lawyer in James’ office, said in an opening statement, while Trump sat at a defense table.\n\nWallace also placed blame squarely on Trump on Monday, saying “Every estimate was determined by Mr. Trump.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nTrump trial live: What claims is Trump facing?\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron will decide on six claims in this case. They include:\n\nConspiracy to falsify business records\n\nIssuing false financial statements\n\nFalsifying business records\n\nInsurance fraud\n\nConspiracy to falsify false financial statements\n\nConspiracy to commit insurance fraud\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAlina Habba, Eric Trump: Who\'s with Donald Trump today?\n\nThe former president entered the New York courthouse on Monday with attorney Alina Habba, his son Eric Trump and Jason Miller, a strategist.\n\nHe was joined by additional attorneys and others, according to multiple reports.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James: ‘We have proven that Donald Trump lied about his net worth’\n\nBefore the trial began, Attorney General Letitia James reiterated her position that Trump for years “falsely inflated his net worth to enrich himself and cheat the system.”\n\nJames said the government won much of its case last week, when the judge ruled Trump engaged in years of fraud, so the trial will determine whether Trump is banned from doing business in New York and whether he will have to pay hundreds of millions in damages.\n\n“We have proven that Donald Trump lied about his net worth to enrich himself and cheat the system,” James said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “No matter how rich or powerful you are, in America, there are consequences for breaking the law.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is Trump actually accused of in this case?\n\nIn this case, Trump and his company are accused of of deceiving banks, insurers and others by lying about his wealth in disclosures.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has ruled that Trump repeatedly committed fraud. There\'s no jury in the case, so the judge will decide on six other claims against the former president and his company.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in penalties, as well as a ban on Trump doing business in the state. The judge’s ruling could force Trump to give up New York properties such as Trump Tower, a Wall Street office building, golf courses and a suburban estate.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nCameras in the courtroom just before Trump\'s trial\n\nThe judge did allow television and photographers into the courtroom - for a little while, before the hearing began.\n\nA television camera caught Trump at the defense table, James in the front row, and Judge Engoron on the bench before a photographer pool was escorted out of the room.\n\nPer usual, the trial itself is not being televised.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump\'s appearance in court is not required – and probably political\n\nDonald Trump doesn\'t have to be in a New York City courtroom today. He chose to be, probably for political reasons.\n\nDefendants in civil cases don\'t have to appear at trial in person. Indeed, Trump did not show up earlier this year for a sexual assault lawsuit filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nThis time around, however, Trump traveled to the courthouse with campaign aides as part of his entourage. At the same time, the campaign sent out fundraising emails, casting this lawsuit as part of an effort to derail his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump himself condemned the lawsuit (again) with an 8-minute campaign-style statement to reporters at the courthouse. After days of rumors, Trump confirmed he would attend the trial in a Truth Social post late Sunday night.\n\n""I’m going to Court tomorrow morning to fight for my name and reputation,"" he said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump claims ‘no crime’ in fraud case\n\nDonald Trump on Monday called the fraud case “election interference” and said no crime was committed. There is no evidence officials have targeted the former president\'s reelection bid.\n\nTrump argued that his properties are more valuable than appraisers or assessors found. He accused the attorney general and judge of corruption and said no crime was committed.\n\n“It’s a scam. It’s a sham. My financial statements are phenomenal,” Trump said. “There was never a default, there was never a problem. There was no crime.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Judge Arthur Engoron? An ex cab driver ex Vietnam protestor who has has ruled on everything from free speech to zoning\n\nThe judge in Trump\'s trial, Arthur Engoron, has overseen hundreds of cases, ranging form free speech debates to zoning fights to custody battles.\n\nA former taxi cab driver who protested the Vietnam War, Engoron has been on the bench for more than two decades.\n\nEngoron is a Democrat and has ruled against Trump many times in the three years he has presided over the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James.Trump has attacked Engoron on social media -- a practice that has gotten him in trouble in some of his other legal cases. Engoron has declined to comment on Trump\'s critiques.– Associated Press\n\nTrump blasts civil lawsuit, NY attorney general and Judge Engoron\n\nCandidate Trump spoke briefly to reporters before the hearing, again claiming that the legal action against him is all political.\n\n""This is a continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time,"" Trump said, an unproved claim he makes at every other 2024 campaign stop.\n\nClaiming he has always submitted legitimate property valuations, Trump attacked the attorney general and judge in the case as politically motivated.\n\nHe called the legal proceeding ""a scam"" and ""a sham.""\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump vows to fight fraud ruling\n\nTrump’s lawyers vowed to challenge the judge’s ruling Tuesday that he committed fraud in valuing properties in the real estate empire in order to get better rates on loans.\n\nTrump in particular disputed the Palm Beach County tax assessor’s value of Mar-a-Lago, which ranged from $18 million to $27 million, from 2011 to 2021. Trump continued to insist the property is worth 50 to 100 times more than that.\n\nThe judge “is working diligently to misrepresent me, and my net worth, which is substantially MORE than is shown on my fully ‘disclaimed’ Financial Statements,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “I have not even included my most valuable asset - BRAND!”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy isn’t Ivanka Trump part of the lawsuit?\n\nThe trial is the result of a $250 million lawsuit New York Attorney General Letitia James filed against Trump and several of his companies.\n\nOther defendants named in the case were executives in the company such as his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney.\n\nTrump’s daughter, Ivanka, wasn’t named as a defendant. But government lawyers have named her as a potential witness in the trial to determine what damages Trump and the companies must pay as a result of the fraud.\n\nGovernment lawyers didn’t have to say what they would ask her.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nLetitia James: ‘We won the foundation of our case’\n\nEarly Monday, Attorney General Letitia James reiterated her position that Trump for years “falsely inflated his net worth to enrich himself and cheat the system.”\n\n“We won the foundation of our case last week and proved that his purported net worth has long been rooted in incredible fraud,” James said in a statement, adding that she looked forward to “demonstrating the full extent of his fraud and illegality during trial.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nIs Trump\'s trial being televised?\n\nAn opening item of business for Trump\'s civil case: Whether to allow broadcast of the proceedings.\n\nNews organizations have asked Judge Arthur Engoron to allow cameras into the courtroom, at least for opening statements. No word yet on how the judge will decide, but the trial is expected to open at the top of the hour.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nIs Trump going to jail?\n\nNo, today the former president is facing a civil trial to determine how much he and his companies will be penalized for fraud. New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in damages.\n\nThat\'s different than the four sets of criminal charges that Trump faces.\n\nHe has been charged on the federal level with allegedly mishandling classified documents after he left office and attempting to steal the 2020 presidential election. In Georgia, he also faces allegations of trying to steal the 2020 race for the White House, and in New York state, he\'s accused of perpetrating a hush money scheme. Those cases to carry potential prison sentences.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump leaves for the courthouse, media in tow\n\nAs television cameras whirred, the former president departed Trump Tower en route to the courthouse.\n\nBroadcast choppers tracked the motorcade as it snaked south through the streets on Manhattan, just as they all did earlier this year as Trump went to a courthouse to plead not guilty to criminal charges in New York involving hush money.\n\nAgain, an army of media awaits Trump at the courthouse for this civil trial.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nA game of monopoly?\n\nLike a game of Monopoly, Trump may be forced to sell off his iconic properties under a New York judge\'s ruling that he committed fraud for years while building his real estate empire.\n\nAt stake is whether the former president will have to shutter or break up his namesake Trump Organization and sell off those famous properties − and whether he will have to pay millions.\n\nLast week, New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron canceled Trump\'s business certificates by ruling he committed fraud for years through ""pure sophistry,"" a ""fantasy world"" of real-estate valuations that ""can only be considered fraud.""\n\nHe ruled that Trump companies often valued properties far higher than appraisers or tax assessors. Trump testified that a disclaimer on property values given to lenders meant they knew the estimates were “worthless,"" according to the decision.\n\nGovernment and defense lawyers have 30 days to submit proposals for who should manage what happens under the judge\'s ruling.\n\nLanguage accompanying Trump\'s estimated values acknowledged they “are not necessarily indicative of the amount that could be realized.” In a sworn deposition, Trump called it the “worthless clause” for stating property values are uncertain.\n\n“I think it had very little impact if any impact on the banks,” Trump said. “I felt it was a meaningless document.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2023/11/27/Defense-Trump-witness-stand-civil-fraud-trial/7371701132941/', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump will return to testify in New York civil fraud trial ...', 'Snippet': 'Lawyers for Donald Trump said Monday they will call the former president to the witness stand again in the closing days of his ongoing $250 million fraud trial in New York state court.', 'Full_text': 'Nov. 27 (UPI) -- Lawyers for Donald Trump said Monday they will call the former president to the witness stand again in the closing days of his ongoing $250 million fraud trial in New York state court.\n\nDefense Attorney Chris Kise told Judge Arthur Engoron that Trump likely will be called as the last witness in his own defense on Dec. 11, ABC News and NBC News reported.'}}",96.25,1

That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.', 'Full_text': 'Before former President Donald Trump spoke for 90 minutes in Durham, New Hampshire, his team compared Trump’s record with President Joe Biden’s record by projecting a series of statistics on the wall.\n\nThe images shown Dec. 16 had the tagline ""Better off with Trump"" and covered mortgage payments, mortgage rates and inflation.\n\nHere’s a fact-check of three statements. The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/opinions/commentary-trump-cnn-town-hall/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: The chilling reality of Trump - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN Opinion asked expert contributors to weigh in with their reactions to former President Donald Trump’s CNN town hall on Wednesday night. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nPaul Begala: Trump whined, griped and complained\n\nMore than 400,000 Americans died from Covid-19 during the Trump presidency. 2.9 million Americans lost their jobs while former President Donald Trump was in the White House. Opioid deaths skyrocketed, and the national debt exploded by $7 trillion during Trump’s tenure.\n\nBut in tonight’s CNN town hall, Trump told us who the real victim of this era is: Donald Trump.\n\nFrom the opening question to his last comment, Trump whined, griped and complained. It was an airing of grievances that will doubtless thrill his MAGA base, but may well motivate anti-Trump voters just as much. And there’s little indication he did enough to win over independent voters.\n\nThis was vintage Trump: whining about the election he lost, grumbling about being indicted in New York, moaning about the jury that found him liable for the civil offense of sexual abuse and defamation. He used the first-person pronoun in nearly every sentence, sounding like a tenor warming up for the opera: “Me, me, me, me, meeeeee.”\n\nHe failed to acknowledge the very real pain felt by so many Americans – including the millions who voted for him. There was not a hint of empathy for the heroic cops who were brutally attacked on January 6. Not a mention of the struggling rural families wrestling with the demon of opioid abuse. Not a word of thanks for veterans and their families. Not a thought for the tens of millions of women whose rights have been rolled back by Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices – just triumphant boasting about how he was the GOP president who actually delivered on the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt’s all about him. It always has been. Trump is a narcissist in a hall of mirrors.\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.\n\nJill Filipovic: Trump needs women to win in 2024, but he doesn’t seem to care\n\nIf female voters are key to a Donald Trump victory in 2024, the former president should be in big trouble – but he doesn’t seem to care.\n\nAfter being found liable for sexual abuse by a New York jury earlier this week, Trump took to the CNN town hall stage Wednesday night and proceeded to mock and berate Kaitlan Collins, the female anchor questioning him (a “nasty” person, he called her) after mocking and berating E. Jean Carroll, who just bested him in court. And to boot, he boasted about his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a move that cost many Republicans elections.\n\nA man whose misogyny was so extreme and unvarnished he inspired the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement is back. On Wednesday night, he made clear that he’s as sexist as ever – something that didn’t seem to bother many in the crowd.\n\nThe town hall audience – selected on the basis of their intention to vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire – appeared to be made up mostly of Trump fans. The crowd generally cheered Trump and his sentiments disparaging whichever woman was in his crosshairs.\n\nThe targeting of Carroll was particularly egregious, considering that a jury just penalized Trump to the tune of $5 million for what they found to be his sexual abuse of Carroll and his defamation of her for calling her claims a “hoax” and a “con job.” At the town hall, he again denied Carroll’s claims, and then turned her into a joke, cruelly laying into her while his fans cheered and jeered.\n\nMany of those fans, of course, were women. There are a significant number of female voters, the overwhelming majority of them White, who are either so accepting of or so used to rank misogyny that they have no issue voting for a man who has boasted about grabbing women’s genitals and whom a jury believes is more likely than not a sexual abuser. And there are, of course, a greater number of men who find Trump’s misogyny excusable enough to cast their ballots in his favor – and even applaud him.\n\nTrump’s attacks on and ridicule of various women in such a short span of time were a harsh reminder of who he is. The question is whether voters in 2024, unlike so many in 2016, will care.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nScott Jennings: This is how Trump won in 2016\n\nTrump likely agreed to the CNN town hall to show he’s vigorous enough to handle the rigors of a campaign and ultimately another term in the White House. He surely wants to make a clear comparison to President Joe Biden, who rarely takes questions from the press and frequently struggles with prepared remarks. Polling has shown voters have significant concerns about Biden’s fitness for office, and Trump, should he become the GOP nominee, would benefit if the race was decided on those grounds.\n\nThere’s simply no contest between Trump’s ability to have a quick-paced back-and-forth with a reporter and Biden’s. On Wednesday night, he bullied his way through questions about the 2020 election, the Capitol riot on January 6 and this week’s judgment against him for defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile this may turn off most American voters — particularly critical suburban independents in swing states — it will thrill many Republican primary voters who love to see him bulldoze his way through questions from CNN and other mainstream outlets. The Republican-leaning audience in attendance was clearly pleased with what they heard.\n\nTo analyze this town hall, you have to understand that Trump speaks a language that is understood by his biggest supporters and most GOP primary voters but is not and has never been understood by the media or the Democrats.\n\nIt has never proven to be a language that can attract more voters in a national popular election. But he’s still the master of this language, which he invented back in 2016, and Wednesday’s engagement will be judged a complete success by his campaign as it tries to lock up the 2024 nomination.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nAshley Allison: Now is the moment to stop Trump\n\nAlert! This is not a test. Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and on Wednesday night there was an audience of voters applauding for him in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking to them, Trump wouldn’t say he regrets January 6. He wouldn’t say which country he wants to win the war – Russia or Ukraine. Trump wouldn’t say he would not sign a national abortion ban. He wouldn’t say he lost the 2020 election. Trump even thought the US should default on its debt.\n\nAmerican voters, say where you stand so the record will reflect it. This means you must be able to assert: There should not be a federal abortion ban. I stand with Ukraine. Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And January 6 was an insurrection based on lies. If you cannot say these things, you have betrayed your democracy.\n\nTo the majority of Americans who believe these truths, according to a Pew Research survey, say them out loud – proudly and constantly. Commit to put country over politics, democracy over tyranny, justice over abuse.\n\nThis is bigger than any political party. This is bigger than any one candidate. This is the moment to be a patriot and stop Trump from ever again serving as President of the United States.\n\nThat’s it. That is the clarion call. Alert!\n\nAshley Allison is the CEO of Turner Conoly Group. She is a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama and former senior aide to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nFrida Ghitis: If Trump wins, Putin will be happy and Ukraine will suffer\n\nWatching Trump once again disparage American democracy, it’s not particularly surprising to learn that if he became president again, he would not help Ukraine win the war to repel Russia’s brutal aggression and invasion of its territory.\n\n“We’re giving away so much equipment,” he lamented. And when pressed to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, Trump refused to answer.\n\nHe repeated his claim that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if he were president. The reality is likely quite the opposite.\n\nAs president, Trump delayed sending support that Ukraine was urgently requesting and Congress had already approved – and was impeached. His clashes with allies and the divisions he fomented likely gave Russian President Vladimir Putin the impression that NATO might not stand together to help Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump becomes president before the war is over, there is every chance that he could clog up the pipeline of support from the United States – the world’s leading democracy – for Ukraine, another democracy that is under brutal attack. And there is absolutely no doubt that he would reignite the clashes between the US and its NATO allies, which threatened to unravel an alliance that is now reinvigorated, with a new sense of mission, and a crucial role to play.\n\nTrump had already showed his cards on Ukraine in a recent interview with Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity that “Ultimately, [Putin] is going to take over all of Ukraine.” If Putin does erase Ukraine from the map, there is reason to believe Trump would not find that terribly objectionable.\n\nFrida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review.\n\nAlice Stewart: Trump needs to come up with better answers on abortion\n\nAbortion policy stood out at Trump’s town hall Wednesday night. He managed to tout his pro-life record without boxing himself into a corner on a federal abortion ban. While this is a strategic answer, it could prove to be problematic for Trump.\n\nWhen asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected, Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.”\n\nTrump is clearly playing to the general election audience.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, about two-thirds of adults believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while almost a third say it should be illegal. This play to the general election voters could cost him some GOP primary support.\n\nThere’s no question, the pro-life community considers Trump the most consequential president in American history on abortion. Evangelicals rallied in support of Trump for his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who made history in overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nThe problem is, Trump’s past performance on protecting the sanctity of life is strong, but his future commitments are about to be put to test in the 2024 GOP primary. Other Republican primary candidates have committed to signing a federal abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. This policy distinction will not go unnoticed.\n\nSusan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America has indicated they will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to support at minimum a 15-week national standard on abortion.\n\nAn endorsement from SBA and other pro-life organizations is vital in a Republican primary. A states-only position on abortion is not acceptable for the pro-life movement. Trump may need to come up with a better answer to keep the pro-life community in his good graces.\n\nAlice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President.\n\nRaul A. Reyes: Trump’s words about family separation were chilling\n\nIn 2015, candidate Donald Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his improbable run for the presidency by referring to immigrants as “rapists” and criminals.\n\nIt seems that not much has changed in the years since – as the now-former president is unrepentant in his anti-immigrant views. In his CNN town hall on Wednesday, Trump claimed “people” were “coming in” after being released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that migrants are coming to the border from mental institutions or prisons. The former president also doubled down on his horrific (and unpopular) family separation policy at the border and reiterated his false claim that he built “hundreds of miles” of the border wall.\n\nTrump’s language regarding immigrants was not only divisive, it was – and is – dangerous. It seems that he has learned nothing about the power of his words to drive anti-Latino violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso in 2019. And any possibility of a return to the family separation policy, which was truly a dark time in US history, is absolutely chilling.\n\nSadly, based on applause, Trump’s ugly rhetoric seemed popular with his not-so-diverse audience at Saint Anselm College. Yet New Hampshire is hardly representative of the US overall, and Trump said nothing tonight that might win over new voters.\n\nKaitlan Collins fact-checked Trump vigorously, but this town hall often felt like a Trump rally. On immigration, as well as myriad other issues, Trump was entirely predictable and misleading. We have all seen this act before, and it’s really, really tired. If Trump’s campaign was hoping to gain any new supporters or showcase a new image for the former president, this evening represented a resounding failure to launch.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes.\n\nSE Cupp: This was a brutal reminder that Trump isn’t defeated\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m fairly dejected after watching Wednesday night’s Trump town hall in New Hampshire.\n\nOur job, as journalists, is to hold powerful people accountable and ask them tough questions. Our intrepid anchor Kaitlan Collins did just that. However, the premise is that the person in power on the receiving end of those questions will answer them. What Trump did was hijack a town hall to do what he always does – distract, deflect, lie, insult his opponents, insult his questioner and play to his base, who loves it all.\n\nWatching Trump do this for over an hour, as a clearly packed crowd of his supporters applauded and laughed at his lies and smears, was a brutal reminder that Trump is not defeated, he is not chastened nor is he irrelevant. It was also a warning that these kinds of events, however well-intentioned, are not in the best service of democracy, transparency, accountability or any of the other things good journalism efforts at.\n\nSE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.\n\nMondaire Jones: America is in greater danger than we thought\n\nThe audience reactions during CNN’s presidential town hall with Trump show that America is in greater danger than perhaps many of us thought.\n\nThe assembly of Republican and “undeclared” voters at St. Anselm College in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire stood behind Trump, raucously applauding the former president throughout the night despite the stream of falsehoods he uttered — including lies about the 2020 election being stolen.\n\nThey applauded when he said he would consider pardoning “a large portion” of the January 6 insurrectionists, whose violence he greatly downplayed. They also laughed when he mocked E. Jean Carroll, who won a civil lawsuit against him on Tuesday, with a federal jury finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.\n\nThese reactions show how entrenched Trumpism is within the Republican Party. The audience members who applauded Trump’s lies and immoral behavior on stage represent a Republican electorate that largely rejects widely disseminated, clear evidence contradicting what it wants to believe or — worse — knows is the truth and doesn’t care.\n\nMondaire Jones is a CNN political commentator and former Representative for New York’s 17th Congressional District. He also serves as a member of the US Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nGeoff Duncan: Trump is stuck in 2020, and so far the GOP is too\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage at Saint Anselm College as the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, but it’s clear that his mindset is still stuck in 2020.\n\nFrom accusing former Vice President Mike Pence of doing something “wrong” on January 6 to defending his “perfect” call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a defiant Trump dug in on the election denialism that has come to define his presidency. He refused to back down from the disproven claims that there was widespread election fraud in 2020, and even labeled January 6 a “beautiful day.”\n\nOn the major policy issues of the day – immigration, federal debt, abortion – he offered little, if anything, in the way of specifics. He barely took the time to remind voters about the rightful accomplishments of his presidency, like the significant tax cuts that were enacted in 2017.\n\nThe town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his fitness for office. But Trump squandered the opportunity to exploit Biden’s weaknesses, and instead of using the primetime appearance to appeal to swing voters in the suburbs, he played the base’s greatest hits.\n\nStill, Trump’s charisma and showmanship were undeniable. The crowd roared with applause at multiple moments. Thus far, it’s undeniable that Trump is the leader of the GOP pack.\n\nIf Republicans fall for his snake oil again, we have no one but ourselves to blame if we lose another election.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/09/trump-arizona-kari-lake-blake-masters-election-rally/8209439001/', 'Headline': 'Trump in Arizona: Recap from Kari Lake, Blake Masters rally in Mesa', 'Snippet': ""The event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November's election.

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/politics/arizona-trump-rally-voting-rights-democracy-in-peril/index.html', 'Headline': 'An Arizona Trump rally and voting rights march underscore the ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Two events – a Trump rally and a voting rights march – in the same state on the same day this Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend encapsulated a nation at odds with itself about the future of ...', 'Full_text': 'Two events – a Trump rally and a voting rights march – in the same state on the same day this Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend encapsulated a nation at odds with itself about the future of its democracy.\n\nOne side fears a return to the past, hearing echoes of Jim Crow in the present.\n\nThe other has been convinced by a sustained disinformation campaign that elections in the United States are rigged.\n\nThe latter was out in full force on Saturday at former President Donald’s Trump’s first rally of 2022, in Florence, Arizona. Among the dozen or so Trump supporters there who spoke to CNN, grand conspiracy theories – all of which have been debunked – about how the 2020 election was supposedly rigged (like through voting machines linked to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013) seem to have given way to more refined talking points that closely align with restrictive voting measures being enacted by Republicans across the country.\n\n“There’s a famous statement – ‘sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,’ ” Trump said in a video posted online Friday, underscoring how Republicans motivated by his election lies have sought to undermine the legitimacy of America’s elections. Arizona – which President Joe Biden carried in 2020, becoming the first Democrat to carry the state since 1996 – has been at the center of those efforts.\n\nIn Florence on Saturday, Trump showed exactly what kind of “vote counters” he approves of.\n\nSpeaking at his rally, Kari Lake, Trump’s pick for governor, said there were a few people she “would like to send right down to the prison here in Florence. Anybody who was involved in that corrupt, shady, shoddy election of 2020. Lock them up.”\n\nMark Finchem, an Arizona state representative whom Trump has endorsed to be the state’s top election official as secretary of state, has previously echoed QAnon-type conspiracy theories about election officials and continues to maintain that the vote in Arizona was stolen from Trump, which has been widely disproved. Even a partisan audit of results in Maricopa County, commissioned by state Senate Republicans, affirmed Biden’s victory in the county.\n\nFinchem has previously been linked to the Oath Keepers, a right-wing extremist group. Some of its members were charged last week with “seditious conspiracy” related to the US Capitol attack.\n\n“I look forward to the day that we set aside an irredeemably flawed election. That’s the election of 2020. With all the evidence we have, the Arizona election should be decertified with cause by the legislature,” Finchem said, repeating the former President’s lies from the podium at his rally Saturday.\n\nA year’s-long sustained attack on the integrity of American elections has paved the way to make candidates like these the natural choice in 2022 for Trump, who’s trying to exercise his influence over the GOP – including local election officials – at the same time he’s eyeing another bid for the White House in 2024. A recent Washington Post tally found that “at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump’s false claims are running for statewide positions that would give them authority over the administration of elections.”\n\nBut also at the Trump rally was rare praise for a Democrat.\n\n“She’s our representative, she represents the state, she is not along party lines, she’s what’s good for the country,” Robbie Kimsey, an Arizona voter and Trump supporter, said of Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nSinema, along with Sen. Joe Machin of West Virginia, is blocking the passage of a pair of voting rights bills that Democrats hope could counter some of the restrictive voting measures enacted by Republicans at the state level. Sinema has said she is supportive of the bills but not in favor of changing Senate rules to get them passed.\n\nThe opposition of these two moderate Democrats is frustrating voting rights activists, including those who gathered in Arizona this weekend.\n\n“She says she wants voting rights, but how do you want voting rights without creating a path for that to happen? That is inconsistent; that is unacceptable,” Martin Luther King Jr.’s son Martin Luther King III told CNN in Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nThe King family had traveled to Arizona to take part in a voting rights march, calling on Sinema to act – warning that history would not judge her kindly.\n\n“I think we are really at a defining moment,” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democratic hopeful for governor, told CNN.\n\nHobbs said democracy had prevailed in 2020 because election officials on both sides of the aisle had done their jobs – but now, with Trump-endorsed election deniers running for jobs that would give them authority over elections, the future is less certain.\n\n“The election in 2022, I think, is going to determine the future of our democracy,” Hobbs said.\n\nThat was a sentiment echoed by Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s 13-year-old granddaughter, who was with her family this weekend in Phoenix, telling CNN, “I think it’s so important to vote and it’s so important to have the right to vote, because right now our country is at stake.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/10/10/trump-rally-mesa-takeaways/8232033001/', 'Headline': '3 Arizona Trump rally takeaways after a scorching day in Mesa', 'Snippet': 'After a scorching Sunday in Mesa, here are 3 Trump rally takeaways.

Here’s five takeaways from Mr Trump’s event in Arizona.', 'Full_text': 'Former president Donald Trump held his first rally of 2022 in Arizona, one of the focal points of his “Big Lie” that the election was rigged. Throughout the rally, Mr Trump raged against his enemies as much in the Republican Party as well as President Joe Biden and the media.\n\nHere’s five takeaways from Mr Trump’s event in Arizona.\n\nTrump still runs the GOP\n\nKari Lake, a former Arizona news anchor and gubernatorial candidate, gave one of the rally’s opening speeches and joined Mr Trump onstage.\n\nBefore the former president arrived in Arizona, Kimberly Yee, the Republican state treasurer and also a candidate for governor, announced she would end her campaign and instead would run for state treasurer. Mr Trump also railed against Arizona’s outgoing Republican Governor Doug Ducey, whom he has loathed for not decertifying the 2020 election results.\n\n“He’s never going to get my endorsement,” he said, amid rumors Mr Ducey is considering a run for the Senate against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nMr Trump also danced on the graves of retiring Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting the US Capitol riot on January 6, most recently Rep John Katko of New York. He vocally criticized Reps Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both of whom sit on the select committee investigating the riot and the latter of whom is not seeking reelection.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. We’re getting rid of them fast,” he said.\n\nThe ‘Big Lie’ is now an article of faith\n\nMr Trump opened the rally by saying “The Big Lie is a lot of bulls***.”\n\nThroughout he spoke of how he won the election and continued to spread repeated lies on the 2020 presidential race to thunderous applause.\n\n“I ran twice and we won twice and we did better the second time. We did much better the second time,” Mr Trump said.\n\nHe also dismissed concerns about the January 6 attempted insurrection by his supporters and instead continued to repeat claims of impropriety and that Democrats used measures during the pandemic to enable mail-in voting to steal the election.\n\n“Why aren’t they investigating November 3rd a Rigged and Stolen Election,” he said. “The people are very angry. They got duped and they found out what happened. The people have to be free to find the answers and if not, they will never trust again and our country will be absolutely decimated.”\n\nTrump openly espoused conspiracy theories about January 6 and sympathy for rioters\n\nThe former president has long promoted conspiracy theories unrelated to the election. But throughout the rally, Mr Trump openly espoused the conspiracy theory that Ray Epps - previously on the FBI’s most wanted list - was a government informant and goaded people to come into the Capitol.\n\n“Exactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants, agents or otherwise, working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government,” he said. “People want to hear this.\n\nHe also expressed sympathy for some rioters who are currently in jail awaiting trial for their actions at the US Capitol and said they are “living in hell.”\n\n“The bathrooms are horrible,” he said, adding that “If we think they’re innocent, we should help them defend themselves.”\n\nHe also repeated his sympathy for Ashli Babbitt, the pro-Trump rioter who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer after she stormed the building.\n\nLetitia James is target #1, even above Biden\n\nOne target of Mr Trump’s ire stood out from all the rest on Saturday, thanks to the former president’s social media and graphics teams.\n\nThe nearly two-hour rally was interrupted about halfway through for a pre-produced video that the former president showed his fans. In the video, which was up for less than a minute, statements made by New York Attorney General Letitia James about her desire to go after Mr Trump for longstanding accusations of fraud were highlighted.\n\nThe moment stood out, as it marked the only time in the rally that Mr Trump relinquished the microphone other than to allow remarks from Kari Lake, his favoured candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nMs James was also the only one of Mr Trump’s Democratic rivals, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to get the pre-produced attack video treatment.\n\nThe New York Attorney General is currently involved in a case pursuing the Trump Organization for fraud claims.\n\nImpeachment supporters are still on Trump’s mind\n\nNormally, it would make little sense for a president to call out a retiring, low-profile GOP congressman by name and bring him on onstage at a rally located on the opposite side of the country from their home district.\n\nBut typical logic rarely applies to Trump rallies. On Saturday, Mr Trump named and shamed Representative John Katko, a Republican from New York, over his announcement that he would retire and not seek reelection this year.\n\nThe move would normally be seen as a blow for the Republican Party, which hopes to retain control of Mr Katko’s district (which leans slightly Democratic) and retake the House this fall.\n\nBut not so for Mr Trump, de facto leader of the GOP, who sees Mr Katko as the enemy following the latter’s support for the second impeachment of the former president last year in the wake of the January 6 riot.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. The ones that voted to impeach, we’re getting rid of them fast,” he told his supporters.\n\nNaming the New York congressman, he added: “And John Katko is now gone, we just got rid of Katko.”\n\nThe announcement was met with a smattering of applause. However the majority of the crowd appeared not to associate the name with the effort to impeach Mr Trump, as it did with bigger-name Republicans like Reps Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThe president’s second impeachment trial ended without conviction but nevertheless saw the greatest defection by a president’s party of any impeachment effort in history.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/08/donald-trump-visits-to-arizona-during-his-political-career/8226304001/', 'Headline': ""Donald Trump's visits to Arizona during his political career"", 'Snippet': 'In 2020, despite multiple visits, Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes.

Doug Ducey and the media to the resounding support of the thousands of diehard supporters at Canyon Moon Ranch.\n\nTrump also renewed his grievances and cast his four years in office as a period of unprecedented prosperity and security.\n\nEarly in his remarks, which ended at 8:51 p.m., Trump cast Biden\'s administration as an unfolding disaster and continued his baseless claims of widespread election fraud in 2020.\n\n""Biden has utterly humiliated our nation,"" Trump said, saying that Russia and China\'s leaders no longer respect or fear America.\n\nTrump said the past year under Biden has been a ""disaster"" but said there would be a good political end to the ""catastrophe"" at the outset of the new year.\n\nThe speech was an updated version of Trump’s usual America-first rhetoric, long on personal boasts and lacking in subtlety.\n\n“The country is being destroyed,” he said, after citing rising inflation and the nation’s disastrous retreat from Afghanistan. “Our country is being totally destroyed.”\n\nTrump called the COVID-19 response under Biden a disaster, from vaccine mandates to testing shortages.\n\n“I’m proud I was the anti-mandate president,” Trump said. “We gave Biden every tool he could want. … He’s incapable.”\n\nTrump kept much of his speech focused on Biden, noting the president’s dismal approval ratings and accusing him of being clueless on tackling the nation’s current problems.\n\nTrump repeated his criticism of former ally Gov.

Hansen\n\n8:25 p.m.: Trump denounces prosecution of Jan. 6 rioters\n\nDonald Trump blasted the House of Representatives select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe called the U.S. prosecution of defendants charged with storming the Capitol an “appalling persecution of political prisoners.”\n\nHe said many of the people at the Capitol were FBI informants, not Trump supporters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump described the supporters he spoke to from the Ellipse, near the White House, on Jan. 6 before the attack on the Capitol as one of the largest crowds he’s ever seen.\n\nTrump called the officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt inside the Capitol a “dope.”\n\nTrump pointed to social protests during 2020 and asked why the Department of Justice wasn’t going after people who participated in them. “Why aren’t they doing it to Antifa and Black Lives Matter?” he said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:25 p.m.: Former President Trump takes the stage\n\nAfter more than two hours of speeches by other politicians, Trump took the stage at 7:17 p.m. with Lee Greenwood\'s ""God Bless the USA"" playing.\n\nHis first sentences mentioned a ""rigged election,"" ""The Big Lie is a lot of bullshit"" and ""I ran twice and I won twice.""\n\nHe called Joe Biden, who defeated him in the 2020 election, ""a disaster for this country.""\n\nHe mentioned unseating U.S. Sen.

Her message of cracking down on undocumented immigrants, canceling mask mandates and anti-abortion legislation resonated strongly.\n\n“I love her,” said Evelyn Harless of Mesa. “Everything she said needs to happen … She’s going to get something done for Arizona.”\n\nHarless, who turned 70 last year, had never attended a political rally before coming to Florence Saturday. And while Trump was the headliner, Lake stole her heart.\n\n“She is just true to her word,” she said.\n\nHarless said she thought Lake’s stance on border security was tough and direct. “I like people coming into this country. I just want it done legally,” she said.\n\nJohn LeTourneau of Mesa used the same words to describe his adulation for Lake: “I love her,” he said.\n\nLeTourneau said he will have no trouble voting for her for governor.\n\n“She’s honest, sincere and wants to fix things that are wrong with Arizona,” he said.\n\nHe praised her stance on the border and keeping elections secure. And he said her criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president on COVID-19, were welcome.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “Fauci is crooked as hell.”\n\nFor Lisa Pray, a soon-to-be-grandma from Dewey, it was Lake’s message of pushing anti-abortion legislation that moved her.\n\nShe said she is proud Lake is willing to push “heartbeat laws” and showed a sonogram picture of her daughter’s new child: “That’s not a fetus. That’s a baby.”\n\nPray said Lake represents Arizona, “she represents us.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:20 p.m.: Democrats issue statement on Trump rally\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesperson Adonna Biel released a statement before former President Donald Trump spoke in Florence.\n\n“Let there be no mistake, the Republican Party has surrendered to Donald Trump’s stranglehold and fully embraced him no matter the cost to our democracy or Americans’ lives,"" it read in part.\n\n""Tonight\'s rally will serve as little more than a reminder of the chaos and extremism of today’s Republican Party, and why 81 million Americans rejected Donald Trump in 2020 to elect President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats who have led the fastest economic recovery in history, delivered a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to repair Arizona’s roads and bridges, gotten Americans vaccinated, and helped create over 6 million jobs.”\n\n— Kathy Tulumello\n\n7 p.m.: Kari Lake vows no COVID-19 mandates, calls out migrants, Biden\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake began her speech echoing the theme of some of the other speakers, praising America under Trump and listing its problems under Biden. As did others, she called Trump “president” and slammed the 2020 election as “rotten to the core.”\n\nShe vowed to “close every single loophole that allows them to cheat,” though she didn’t give details.\n\nHer wide-ranging comments touched on COVID-19 mandates that she said “people are no longer willing to put up with.”\n\nClaiming she was up “30 points” or more in polls of voters, Lake said, “There will be no mandates and no lockdowns” with her as governor.\n\nShe also called out migrants without papers. “To the people flooding across our border: When I’m governor, you will be arrested and sent back across the border.”\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how she would do that without federal cooperation, but her comments echoed those at a news conference on border security on Tuesday by state lawmakers and Ken Cuccinelli, a former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official under Trump, who claimed that the “self-defense clause” in the U.S. Constitution allows states to take action even without the federal government in times of invasion.\n\n“We are being invaded, and China is pushing deadly fentanyl through Mexico,” said Lake, who then addressed Biden: “It’s going to stop with me … We do not need your protection, your permission to defend our state.”\n\nShe vowed to finish building Trump’s border wall in Arizona, sparking crowd members to chant, “Build that wall! Build that wall!”\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n6:40 p.m.: Members of Congress, candidates cheer Trump, boo others\n\nThe crowd booed the news media, booed Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and booed election workers. Crowd members may have been Republicans, but they were firmly committed to one man, Donald Trump, and the idea that Biden stole the election from him.\n\nThe politicians who warmed up the crowd for Trump hammered home the points. U.S. House members Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar ripped Biden and exhorted the crowd to get ready for the next elections.\n\n“Can you feel the storm building?” Gosar asked.\n\nAnthony Kern, a former state representative who’s running for state Senate and who was in Washington near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, began yelling, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” as the former president’s helicopter descended to the festival grounds shortly after 5:30 p.m. “Welcome to Arizona, Mr. President!”\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, Kern and 10 other Arizonans, including state GOP Chair Kelli Ward and Rep. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, signed a document that was sent to Congress with a false avowal that they constituted Arizona’s official vote in the Electoral College.\n\nAll 11 people were listed on the general election ballot as the would-be electors for Trump.\n\nBut Trump had lost Arizona. Ducey had certified the election results in late November. By state statute, the only electors who mattered were those pledged to cast their votes for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as they did Dec. 14, 2020, at noon.\n\nThe document the Republicans signed, obtained from the National Archives last year by the group American Oversight, overlooked that detail.\n\nIt described the “undersigned” as the “duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Arizona …”\n\nReferring to complaints that he and those electors should be criminally charged, Kern said the “real criminals are the ones who stole the election.”\n\nSen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, who’s running for Arizona secretary of state, continued that tack.\n\n“We are so blessed to have Donald Trump with us here today. We know the election was stolen,” Rogers said.\n\n“They attacked Donald Trump because he exposed them and their evil deeds!” Finchem said.\n\n— Ray Stern and Richard Ruelas\n\n6:10 p.m.: State senators continue to claim election fraud\n\nState lawmakers Sen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, and Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, told the crowd to stay committed to the election denial conspiracy, as they would.\n\nBorrelli pushed back on the fact that the belief in widespread election fraud that stole the presidency from Trump in 2020 was a “conspiracy theory.” He said there was indeed a conspiracy, but he claims ""it’s not a theory.”\n\nHe said the problem was “obstructionists” who oversee elections at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office and in Maricopa County.\n\nTownsend and Borrelli were among 30 current and former Arizona lawmakers who signed a resolution asking for the 2020 election to be handed to Trump or for the election certification to be delayed. Borrelli said that many of his peers in the Arizona House and Senate were behind him and other election deniers and that they were going to “tighten up the loopholes that these commie (expletive) have exploited.”\n\nThe crowd cheered as Borrelli claimed that the “shamestream media” were hiding facts like “ghost voters” he says were found to have voted in Pima County in 2020. Pima County election officials deny there were any widespread problems with the election.\n\nTownsend asked how many in the crowd had volunteered for the 2020 election or the Senate-led audit — dozens or more raised their hands. She reminded them that state Attorney General Mark Brnovich is investigating findings from the Senate-led audit and led people in a chant:\n\n“What do we want? Indictments! When do we want them? Now!”\n\nShe referred to unnamed enemies who are “constantly scheming” to steal elections.\n\n“We want indictments of the election workers so that they don’t continue to do this,” she said before going on to condemn “medical tyranny” she sees in COVID-19 emergency measures.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5:30 p.m.: Traffic jams delay Trump fans outside venue\n\nTraffic for the Trump rally was backed up for more than an hour outside Country Thunder in Florence. The line to the front gate snaked back and forth and trailed far into a dirt parking lot as people waited.\n\nBobby Parsons of Cottonwood said he and his wife arrived at 1 p.m. and waited for more than three hours and still hadn\'t made it into the main arena. But he didn\'t mind, not at all.\n\nParsons said he loved the energy of the crowd and couldn\'t wait to see Trump. And if there\'s one message he hopes Trump delivers, it is: ""Tell Biden to get the hell out.""\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n5:15 p.m.: Spending time with \'thousands of people who feel the same way\'\n\nTwo Arizona social workers said their biggest reason for attending the Trump rally is concern for their clients. They said the Biden administration’s handling of the economy has put people who need government services at risk.\n\n“I work for the State of Arizona in the Disability Division, said Colette Lofgren of Apache Junction. “So many people have left their jobs at the state that we cannot get services for people.”\n\nThe ""Great Resignation"" has left the agency with such a backlog that workers are struggling to get to them.\n\nHer friend Sandra Wilson of Mesa nodded in agreement. Wilson works for the Department of Child Safety and said the same issues plague her office.\n\nThe women both said the country’s economic situation, with inflation and supply-chain issues, have taken a personal toll.\n\n“I was getting to the age of retirement,” Lofgren said. “There is no way under this administration that I can move forward with my dreams.”\n\nLofgren said a year ago she was preparing to build a home in Mississippi but abandoned those plans as costs rose.\n\n“There was no way I can build a house,” she said.\n\nBoth women said they want to support President Donald Trump, who is the rightful leader of the country.\n\nWilson said she has attended several Trump rallies and enjoys the camaraderie.\n\n“I can be with good friends and be with thousands and thousands of people who feel the same way,” she said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n4:55 p.m.: Ward: Who won the election? Crowd: Trump\n\nMany — if not most — people in the crowd seemed to believe Trump’s insistence that he really won the election by “a lot.” A year of investigation, numerous courts throwing out lawsuits claiming they had evidence of fraud and the results of the audit authorized by the Arizona Senate did not seem to deter crowd members from their belief.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, who took the stage first, made that clear. She gave a brief speech that began by asking the crowd to respond to the question “Who won the election?”\n\n“Trump!” the crowd roared.\n\nSeeming to address concerns by many Republicans about the election system, Ward urged people to “please, please go out and vote.”\n\nWard claimed that “cheating” also occurred in 2016, but “we overwhelmed their cheating algorithm.”\n\n“Get rid of Dominion! Get rid of drop boxes!” she shouted. “Let’s restore integrity to our election.”\n\nMany of the people in the crowd wore colorful costumes, Trump apparel and shirts supporting Trump or Arizona Republican candidates for office such as gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake or U.S. Senate contender Jim Lamon.\n\nThe crowd included many young people and senior citizens, though most in attendance seemed to be middle-aged. The festival atmosphere included food trucks, loudspeakers blaring a mix of country and classic rock, long lines for the portable toilets and a stage with bleachers for VIPs.\n\nDiehard belief in the falsehood that Trump actually won the 2020 election was a strong theme.\n\nTamera Rayl of Tucson, who was hanging out on a blanket with family members, said she believes Biden won through fraud and hopes Arizona lawmakers “get rid of the machines” used in elections and go back to paper ballots that would be hand-counted.\n\nShe believes like-minded Republicans will still be “mad enough” over the 2020 election results to show up at the polls this year despite beliefs that the election system is broken.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n4:45 p.m.: Speaker lineup includes Lake, 3 members of Congress\n\nBesides Trump, speakers were expected to include several politicians who have spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and supported rioters who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They include:\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley.\n\nState Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa.\n\nState Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff.\n\nKari Lake, candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nAnthony Kern, former state representative and candidate for state Senate.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nAlveda King, 2020 campaign advisory board member.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, Trump strategic adviser and 2020 campaign board member.\n\nMike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow.\n\n“You know what day it is,” a voice said over the loudspeaker at about 4 p.m. “It’s Trump Day! Let’s go, Brandon!”\n\nMany in the crowd responded in kind with the veiled, obscene insult of President Joe Biden.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n3:55 p.m.: Crowd gathers for speeches, rally\n\nThousands of spectators began to gather Saturday afternoon at the Country Thunder festival grounds, with traffic backups on State Route 79. Gates opened at 2 p.m. More than a dozen ATVs lined State Route 79 just before the entrance, waving flags and cheering those lined up in their cars. A single protester stood across from a Mercedes sedan on the entry road to the venue, waving a sign with the United States code on it.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n10:30 a.m.: What\'s on Trump\'s list of talking points?\n\nTrump gave a preview of the Saturday rally that suggests he will continue pushing baseless claims of election fraud.\n\n""Look forward to seeing everyone in Arizona tomorrow! Many topics will be discussed including the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020, the fake Big Lie, the corrupt LameStream Media, the Afghanistan disaster, Inflation, the sudden lack of respect for our Nation and its leaders, and much more,"" Trump said in a written statement Friday. ""Big crowds, will also be covered on TV. See you Saturday evening!""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nDEMOCRACY IN DOUBT: Read the series that gets inside the Arizona election review\n\n9 a.m.: Trump takes a shot at Gov. Ducey\n\nHours before his appearance in Florence, Trump took yet another shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who has become a frequent punching bag for the former president ever since Ducey signed off on the 2020 election results.\n\n“Rumors are that Doug Ducey, the weak RINO Governor from Arizona, is being pushed by Old Crow Mitch McConnell to run for the U.S. Senate,” Trump said in a statement. “He will never have my endorsement or the support of MAGA Nation!”\n\nDucey often bristles at any question about whether he will seek the GOP nomination to challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., for his seat later this year.\n\nBut rumors abound nevertheless, in part thanks to high-ranking Republicans in Washington, D.C., including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who are urging establishment Republicans including Ducey to run.\n\nBut Ducey\'s standard reply includes touting his day job as Arizona’s governor and pointing to early 2021, when he said he was not running for the seat. Asked early last week what his future holds after his final year as governor, Ducey said he was focused on leading the state and running the Republican Governors Association, which seeks to elect Republican governors across the country.\n\n“My plate is full,” Ducey told The Arizona Republic. “And I have found in the past, in my career, when I have focused on the work on my desk and done it with excellence, other opportunities present themselves.”\n\nAsked if Ducey would go to Trump’s rally on Saturday, governor’s spokesman C.J. Karamargin said Ducey had “no plans” to attend.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\nFriday afternoon: ReAwaken America Tour leads to police calls at Dream City Church\n\nA conservative forum in Phoenix overlapping Donald Trump\'s return to Arizona opened Friday with calls to police.\n\nAttendees at the ReAwaken America Tour at Dream City Church taunted teachers from the nearby BASIS Phoenix charter school over masks, school officials confirmed.\n\nThe tour, hosted by conservative podcaster Clay Clark and featuring Trump\'s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, is scheduled to run through Saturday.\n\nElection fraud and pandemic conspiracies dominate the itinerary, including a speech titled, ""It’s the COVID-19 Protocols That Are Mass Murdering COVID-19 Patients.""\n\nOther topics include pinpointing where the world is on the Biblical timeline, communicating after the power grid is destroyed and ""Jesus is King & Donald Trump is the REAL president of the United States.""\n\nArizona Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, state Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward are among the scheduled speakers.\n\nA pastor at Dream City Church confirmed about a dozen Phoenix police officers responded to the event Friday and the issue had been ""taken care of.""\n\nHe said ReAwaken America rented space from the church but is not affiliated with the church. He said several armed private security guards were hired by the event.\n\nDream City has hosted a number of conservative events, including a June movie premiere touting 2020 election conspiracies by key operatives in the Arizona Senate\'s largely discredited ballot review.\n\nTrump held a rally at the church in 2020.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\nEarly Friday afternoon: Vendors gear up for Trump rally\n\nDays before Donald Trump\'s rally in Florence, merchandise vendors were staking out highway pullouts and setting up roadside stands more than 20 miles away.\n\nVendors dragged tents, tables and Trump gear from the backs of vehicles beginning Wednesday.\n\nFlags and T-shirts fluttered around canopies in at least three spots within a mile of each other Friday on Hunt Highway just over the Maricopa County line in San Tan Valley.\n\nHunt Highway is one of the central routes for people driving from the East Valley to the Country Thunder venue, where Trump is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nPassing cars gave the occasional honk as they zoomed past on Friday, earning waves from vendors.

One of the Constitution’s framers, George Mason, said during its drafting that members of Congress ""are not only legislators but they possess inquisitorial powers.""\n\nPortrait of George Mason (public domain)\n\nWith the courts’ consistent backing, Congress has undertaken investigations over the past two centuries, from the Teapot Dome corruption scandal in the 1920s to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974. (The House’s historical office also notes that such committees have been used for ""less noble purposes, such as the blacklisting of private citizens during the ‘un-American activities’ hearings in the 1950s."")\n\n""How is the Jan. 6 investigation different from previous ones? My answer is, it really isn’t,"" said James Robenalt, a lawyer and expert on Watergate.\n\nHow did the Jan. 6 committee come to be?\n\nInitially, Democrats and some Republicans wanted to create an independent commission, modeled after the one that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That proposed panel would have been made up of retired public officials, military leaders, and academics, rather than sitting members of Congress. The idea was to insulate the panel’s investigation as much as possible from the partisan fray.\n\nThe bipartisan commission would have included 10 members. House and Senate leaders for the Democratic Party would appoint the commission chair and four other members, while the Republican leaders would appoint the vice chair and four other members.\n\nThe day before the House voted on the legislation, Trump came out in opposition to it and called on Republicans to ""not approve the Democrat trap of the Jan. 6 Commission,"" arguing that it amounted to ""more partisan unfairness."" House Republican leaders joined Trump in opposition. Despite this, the House passed the legislation, with universal support from Democrats and the backing of 35 breakaway Republicans.\n\nBut the Senate killed the commission idea after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out against it, effectively ending any hope that the bill could get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nDemocratic leaders’ Plan B was to establish a congressional select committee — a time-limited panel with a specific investigative charge. This could be accomplished by the House on its own; a simple majority in the House would carry the day.\n\n""Our bipartisan, good-faith proposal was met with a filibuster,"" House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said at the time. ""Now that Senate Republicans have chosen to block the formation of an independent commission, it falls to the House to stay the course and get the answers they deserve.""\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the House approved creation of the select committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the United States Capitol. The resolution passed by a 222-190 margin. Once again, Democrats were unified in support, but the number of Republican votes in favor withered to two: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nUnder the resolution, ""the Speaker shall appoint 13 Members to the Select Committee, 5 of whom shall be appointed after consultation with the minority leader.""\n\nThis is where matters got even more convoluted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., presented Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., with a slate of five nominees to the panel. Pelosi responded that she had no quarrel with three of them: Republican Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Troy Nehls of Texas. But she drew the line at two of McCarthy’s picks: Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who was tapped for the panel’s ranking member slot, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Pelosi maintained that Banks and Jordan were too closely tied to Trump to help carry out a credible investigation.\n\nAfter Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan, McCarthy retracted all five of his nominations, including the three that Pelosi had said she’d accept. ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the unprecedented step of denying the minority party\'s picks for the Select Committee on January 6,"" McCarthy said at the time. ""This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution.""\n\nBut Pelosi had one last move. She proceeded to name the two Republicans who had voted to establish the committee — Cheney and Kinzinger — as members, joining seven Democrats. This produced a committee that was bipartisan, but excluded lawmakers who Democrats believed could be tempted to use the panel as a platform to justify the actions of Trump and his allies, rather than investigate them.\n\nJan. 6 Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., at the Capitol on April 4, 2022. (AP)\n\nWhy do critics say the panel is illegitimate?\n\nIn a lawsuit, the Republican National Committee argued that there were several problems with the select committee’s formation.\n\nFirst, rather than 13 members, as set out in the resolution, the panel ended up with only nine. Second, the panel has no ""ranking member,"" as had been called for in the resolution. And third, the Republicans on the committee were not ones recommended by the Republican leader, McCarthy.\n\nOn May 1, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that none of these concerns were enough to stop the committee\'s work. The ruling was made by Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nKelly wrote that concern over the numerical divergence was ""not an unreasonable position,’"" but he added that the court ""must give ‘great weight’ to the House’s own actions,"" including two occasions when House Republicans failed to challenge the committee’s underlying legitimacy before casting votes related to the committee.\n\nThe House has also argued that there’s precedent for a committee with incomplete membership: a 2005 House panel to investigate the government response to Hurricane Katrina consisted of 11 Republicans and zero Democrats. (Ironically, at the time, Pelosi, then the House minority leader, called the panel a ""sham"" and refused to name committee members.)\n\nAs for the question of a ranking member, Kelly concluded that Cheney, as the panel’s vice chair, fulfilled the same function as a ranking member even if her title was different. And on the question of McCarthy’s lack of input, Kelly pointed to the resolution’s requirement that the speaker needed only to engage in ""consultation"" with the minority leader.\n\n""To ‘consult’ with Minority Leader McCarthy, all Speaker Pelosi had to do was ask for his ‘advice or opinion,’"" Kelly wrote. ""There is no dispute that she did. That she did not accept all his recommendations, and that Minority Leader McCarthy then withdrew all his recommendations, does not mean that Speaker Pelosi failed to consult with him.""\n\nAnother broad complaint in the lawsuit is that the committee’s actions are not advancing a valid legislative purpose.\n\nThis argument didn’t fly with Kelly, either, who noted the committee’s purpose was to investigate if legislation is necessary ""to avert a future Jan. 6-style attack."" He reasoned that the committee need not commit to specific legislation in advance of starting its work, since possible legislation could easily emerge once the committee’s efforts were underway.\n\nKelly’s decision was in line with an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In December 2021, a three-judge panel ruled against Trump’s attempts to block the National Archives from turning over presidential correspondence and documents to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nThe appeals judges wrote that there are ""few, if any, more imperative interests squarely within Congress’s wheelhouse than ensuring the safe and uninterrupted conduct of its constitutionally assigned business.""\n\nFurther bolstering the House panel’s case is that a month later, the Supreme Court denied a motion by Trump to overturn the appeals court decision.\n\nThe collective result of these court decisions, Robenalt said, is to show that ""the committee was properly authorized and that Congress has the power to investigate for valid legislative purposes.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': 'The panel voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump over his role.

Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault.

""I went through them piece by piece to say, no, they were not true.""\n\nAnother witness, Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general in the final days of the Trump administration, said he was called by Trump or met with him virtually every day from the time he ascended to the post in late December 2020. The common theme he said, was ""dissatisfaction about what the Justice Department had done to investigate election fraud.""\n\nThe hearing brought attention to a memorably turbulent stretch at the department as Trump in his final days in office sought to bend to his will a law-enforcement agency that has long cherished its independence from the White House. The testimony was aimed at showing how Trump not only relied on outside advisers to press his election fraud claims but also tried to leverage the powers of federal executive branch agencies.\n\nClark\'s home searched\n\nThe scheme by Trump was a ""brazen attempt"" to use the Justice Department for his own political gain, said Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and chair of the committee.\n\nTrump ""didn\'t just want the Justice Department to investigate,"" Thompson said. ""He wanted the Justice Department to help legitimate his lies, to basically call the election corrupt"" and to appoint a special counsel.\n\nThe Justice Department resisted each demand.\n\nTestimony also focused on a tense Oval Office showdown on Jan. 3, 2021, in which Trump contemplated replacing Rosen with a lower-level official, Jeffrey Clark, who wanted to champion Trump\'s bogus election fraud claims. Donoghue and another senior Justice Department official, Steven Engel, warned Trump that there would be mass resignations at the department if Trump followed through with his plan. Only then did Trump relent.\n\nThe night, and later his administration, ended with Rosen still in his job.\n\nClark\'s name was referenced early in the hearing, with Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger deriding him as a lawyer whose sole qualification was his fealty to Trump. A lawyer for Clark did not return an email ahead of the hearing.\n\n""Who is Jeff Clark?"" Kinzinger asked rhetorically. ""He would do whatever the president wanted him to do, including overthrowing a free and fair democratic election.""\n\nBarely an hour before the hearing began, it was revealed that federal agents this week searched Clark\'s Virginia home, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney confirmed the existence of law enforcement activity in Virginia, where Clark lives, but would not say what it was connected to.\n\nThe hearing is the fifth this month by the committee investigating the run-up to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, when Trump loyalists stormed the building as lawmakers were certifying the results of the election won by Joe Biden. Witnesses have included police officers attacked at the Capitol, as well as lawyers, a television executive and local election officials who all resisted demands to alter results in Trump\'s favour.\n\nThe committee last week presented videotaped depositions of former attorney general Bill Barr, who castigated Trump\'s fraud claims and resigned after failing to convince the president.\n\nThursday\'s hearing focused on what happened next as Rosen, Barr\'s top deputy, took over the department and found himself immediately besieged by Trump\'s demands for action.\n\nIn one phone conversation, according to handwritten notes taken by Donoghue and made public by lawmakers last year, Trump directed Rosen to ""Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen.""\n\nRequests for pardons\n\nAround that time, Trump was introduced by a Republican congressman, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, to Clark, who\'d joined the department in 2018 as its chief environmental lawyer and was later appointed to run its civil division. Clark has been subpoenaed by the committee but was not among the witnesses Thursday. Lawmakers on Thursday played a videotaped deposition showing him repeatedly invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nPerry\'s name surfaced later in the hearing, when the committee played videotaped statements from Trump aides saying that he and several other Republican members of Congress sought pardons from the president that would shield them from criminal prosecution, the testimony revealed.\n\nPerry and fellow Republican Reps. Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks, Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert of Texas all had been involved in efforts to reject the electoral tally or submit ""fake electors."" Gaetz tweeted Thursday that the hearing was a ""political sideshow,"" and Perry denied in a statement having ever sought a pardon.\n\nRosen recounts threat to fire him\n\nThe situation came to a head on Jan. 3, 2021, a Sunday, when Clark informed Rosen in a private meeting at the Justice Department that Trump wanted to replace him with Clark as acting attorney general. Rosen, according to the Senate report, responded that ""there was no universe I could imagine in which that would ever happen"" and that he would not accept being fired by a subordinate.\n\nRosen then contacted the White House to request a meeting. That night, Rosen, Donoghue and Engel, along with Clark, gathered with Trump and top White House lawyers for a contentious, hours-long Oval Office meeting about whether the president should follow through with his plans for a radical leadership change at the department.\n\nAccording to testimony given by Rosen, Trump opened the meeting by saying, ""One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren\'t going to do anything to overturn the election.""\n\nDonoghue and Engel made clear to Trump that they and large numbers of other Justice Department officials would resign if Trump fired Rosen. White House lawyers said the same. Pat Cipollone, then the White House counsel, said the letter that Clark wanted to send was a ""murder-suicide pact.""\n\n""Steve Engel at one point said, \'Jeff Clark will be leading a graveyard. And what are you going to get done with a graveyard,\' that there would be such an exodus of the leadership,"" Donoghue told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""So it was very strongly worded to the president that that would happen.""\n\nDonoghue also sought to dissuade Trump from believing that Clark had the legal background to do as the president wished since he was not a criminal prosecutor at the department.\n\n""And he kind of retorted by saying, \'Well, I\'ve done a lot of very complicated appeals and civil litigation, environmental litigation, and things like that,""\' Donoghue said. ""And I said, \'That\'s right. You\'re an environmental lawyer. How about you go back to your office, and we\'ll call you when there\'s an oil spill.""\''}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out. Here are the key details and ...', 'Snippet': 'Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday.', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-public-meeting/index.html', 'Headline': 'Live updates: Jan. 6 committee votes to issue criminal referrals ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee voted to approve its final report and the referral of multiple criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ during the panel’s final public meeting Monday.', 'Full_text': 'These are the key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee used its final public meeting Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe committee refers Trump to the DOJ\n\nFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112323797/jan-6-hearing-recap-187-minutes', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel details what Trump did — and did not do - NPR', 'Snippet': ""The hearing, led by military veterans Reps.

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more. They\'re literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung.\'\n\nHutchinson recalled Meadow responding: \'You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.\' ""\n\nTrump eventually relented to calls from his aides and allies and recorded a video in the Rose Garden late that afternoon to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nThe committee shared a draft of his remarks, which read: ""I\'m asking for you to leave the Capitol region now and go home in a peaceful way.""\n\nBut in the video, Trump went off script, and didn\'t say those words. Instead, he repeated his false claim that the election was stolen and praised the rioters, saying, ""Go home, we love you.""\n\nThursday\'s witnesses were Trump aides who resigned following Jan. 6\n\nTestifying live Thursday were Matthew Pottinger, Trump\'s deputy national security adviser at the time, and Sarah Matthews, Trump\'s deputy press secretary. The pair resigned following the events of Jan. 6, dismayed by what they deemed an inadequate response from the president at quelling the violence.\n\nMatthews recalled the 2:24 p.m. ET tweet from Trump that read, in part: ""Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done.""\n\n""I thought that the tweet about the vice president was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the green light to these people telling them that what they were doing at the Capitol and entering the Capitol was OK, that they were justified in their anger,"" said Matthews, who described herself as a ""life-long Republican"".\n\nShe added that as a Trump campaign aide, she had seen the impact his words had on his supporters. ""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said. ""It is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service of our democracy.""\n\nHe said when the committee releases its report, it will recommend ""changes to laws and policies to guard against another January 6.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/27/politics/trump-subpoena-january-6-denial/index.html', 'Headline': 'Judge rejects Trump’s House January 6 committee subpoena request ...', 'Snippet': 'The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump’s election subversion case in Washington, DC, denied the former president’s effort to subpoena records from the House select committee that ...', 'Full_text': 'The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump’s election subversion case in Washington, DC, denied the former president’s effort to subpoena records from the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump’s attorneys had claimed in their motion to subpoena records from the committee, its Chairman Bennie Thompson, and others that the committee and federal officials withheld some materials related to the investigation.

He explored naming a conspiracy theorist who was circulating outlandish stories of voting irregularities to serve as a special counsel to look into possible election misdeeds.\n\n“Why don’t you guys just seize machines?” Mr. Trump demanded to know at one point, later calling a top official at the Homeland Security Department when informed that voting machines fell under that agency’s purview, not the Justice Department’s.\n\nWhen top Justice Department officials repeatedly told him that they had investigated and debunked his allegations of widespread election fraud, Mr. Trump said they need not find evidence. “Just say the election is corrupt and leave the rest to me,” he told them.'}}",96.5,1

The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-tweets-testimony/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene to Jan. 6: I Don’t Know Her - VICE', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. ...

That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City, chants with ...', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

This is not your fault. Or [Capitol Police chief Steven] Sund’s fault.”\n\nThe Republicans responsible for the withering report — Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Troy Nehls (R-TX) — are the five congressmen originally nominated to sit on the Jan. 6 committee, until Pelosi vetoed Banks and Jordan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the rest of his nominees in protest. Pelosi then installed two Never Trump Republican outcasts, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nGiven Pelosi’s assiduous grooming of Cheney, no doubt it suited both their interests to focus the final Jan.6 committee report on Trump — and not on Pelosi’s culpability.\n\nBut now the Republicans Pelosi rejected have skewered her in their rival report, dredging up some of what she tried to hide, despite complaining of obstruction from the personnel she controls.\n\nThe report insinuates that the Speaker left the Capitol Police without backup on Jan. 6 because “widespread concern from Democratic leadership over ‘optics’ in the aftermath of the Summer 2020 ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard.”\n\nChief Sund begged repeatedly for troops but has testified that Irving rebuffed him over concern about “optics.” During the violence on Jan. 6, Sund repeated his request, but help was delayed until after the riot ended, because Irving needed to run it up the chain of command, a.k.a. Pelosi.\n\n“The Speaker’s office was heavily involved in planning and decision-making before and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and micromanaged the Sergeant at Arms.”\n\nFrom early December 2020, Pelosi aides attended regular meetings with Irving and Sund to discuss the security plan. So hands-on was Pelosi’s chief of staff Terri McCullough that, at one point, she was editing details of parking, event timing and “language regarding official business visitors” for the Joint Session.\n\nTo illustrate the intense involvement of Pelosi’s office, on Jan. 6 alone, the report records 36 communications between Irving and Pelosi staffers, including 11 with McCullough, and 20 with Jamie Fleet, a Pelosi aide who doubled as a Democratic staff director.\n\nPelosi’s repeated assertions that she has “no power over the Capitol Police” are rejected.\n\n“This is false,” says the report. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff . . .\n\n“House Rules dictate . . . that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”\n\nIndeed, the report says that Pelosi regularly exercised her authority over security matters, “when she directed the use of magnetometers outside the House chamber in the name of safety . . . Similarly, she required masks in the House chamber [and] exerted influence on security protocols at the Capitol related to the perimeter fence . . . She also oversaw the fencing that was erected for a purported rally on September 18, 2021, that never materialized.”\n\nThe report of the Republican refuseniks is an appetizer to potential future investigations next year when they regain subpoena power. It makes sensible recommendations to prevent another disaster, including reform and oversight of the Capitol Police Board.\n\nFar from being a revenge ploy, it identifies security flaws it claims have not been remedied, including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and hopelessly outnumbered when “criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with … the Joint Session of Congress.”\n\nThe Capitol Police Intelligence Division “failed to warn USCP leadership and line officers about the threat of violence,” despite having “obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence.”\n\nIn fact, the final intelligence threat assessment three days before the riot did warn of a violent scenario in which “Congress itself” could be attacked by armed Trump supporters. But the warning was buried towards the end of the 15-page document and was not included in the up-front summary, so was overlooked. Nor was the warning mentioned in three subsequent daily intelligence reports.\n\nThe Republicans blame much of the intelligence failure on the assistant director of the USCP intelligence division, Julie Farnam, who had joined the Capitol Police from the Department of Homeland Security only 10 weeks before the riot.\n\nAnalysts testified that “the section became ‘nonfunctional’ immediately upon Farnam’s arrival as she tried to “consolidate power for herself to the detriment of the safety and security of the Capitol.”\n\n“Documents and testimony show that, immediately upon joining the USCP, and without time to acclimate, Farnam began to dismantle the systems that had kept the Capitol safe for so long,” the report alleges.\n\n“Information about planned protests and threats of violence were siloed and not properly analyzed and disseminated during this key period because of Farnam’s misplaced priorities.”\n\nOne analyst testified: “at the time of January 6, we were not doing proactive searches of social media like we had been before. We were strictly reactive.”\n\nAs a result, USCP leadership “were not fully informed about the severity of the threats against the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021”.\n\nHowever, Farnam told CBS this year that her team does not bear any responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and provided adequate threat assessments to police leadership before the riot.\n\n“I think we did an excellent job . . . I am the one who has worked tirelessly . . . to right this ship.”\n\nAfter cataloguing so many tragic failures, the report concludes on a poignant note with messages to Irving from friends in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.\n\n“You’re quite something to take this one for the team, Paul, as they say. I know how these things work and you know I do, too.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32LN3YT', 'Headline': 'Nancy Pelosi footage revives false January 6 claims, conspiracy ...', 'Snippet': 'Social media users claim House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""staged"" the January 6, 2021 attack at the US Capitol by rejecting security assistance and hiring a camera crew working with her daughter, a documentary filmmaker, to record her response as the violence played out.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/pelosi-jan-6-capitol-riot-video/index.html', 'Headline': 'CNN Exclusive: New footage shows congressional leadership at Fort ...', 'Snippet': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command ...', 'Full_text': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe January 6 select committee aired snippets of the footage at its public hearing on Thursday, but CNN has obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel.\n\nCongressional leaders contemplated, far more seriously than previously known, whether to reconvene the Electoral College proceedings at Fort McNair, the footage obtained by CNN reveals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of months of false claims about election fraud, including a litany recited by then-President Donald ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/13/pelosi-congressional-leaders-capitol-january-6-hearing-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': '‘Do you believe this?’: New video shows Pelosi’s reaction ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House January 6 select committee revealed never-before-seen footage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders reacting to the Capitol attack from a secure location.', 'Full_text': 'The House January 6 select committee revealed never-before-seen footage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders reacting to the Capitol attack from a secure location.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/jan-6-pelosi-schumer-capitol-riot-video-201232951.html', 'Headline': 'Dramatic new Jan. 6 footage shows Pelosi and Schumer calling ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""A violent mob of President Donald Trump's supporters storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “I don't know if you had been approached about the Virginia National Guard … but I still think you probably need the OK of the federal government in order to come into another jurisdiction.\n\n“Oh, my God, they're just breaking windows or doing all kinds of — it's really that somebody, they said somebody was shot,” she continued. “It's just horrendous, and all at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer urged Rosen to get Trump to put out a statement calling off the mob.\n\n“Why don't you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility?” Schumer asked. “A public statement that they should all leave.”\n\n“They're breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that. That's nothing,” Pelosi explained. “The concern we have about personal safety just transcends everything.”\n\nLater in the video, Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell, as well as Reps. Steve Scalise and Steny Hoyer and Sen. John Thune, are seen huddled together on a call to the Department of Defense, pleading for troops to be sent in.\n\n“We need them there now, whoever you got,” Schumer said.\n\n“Just pretend for a moment that it were the Pentagon or the White House or some other entity that was under siege,” Pelosi said. “Let me say you can logistically get people there as you make the plan.”\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex — not just Democrats,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said while introducing the footage. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing — what he simply refused to do.”""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/new-video-clips-january-6-attack/index.html', 'Headline': 'Watch: Key moments from new footage of the January 6 Capitol attack - CNN', 'Snippet': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seen in the new footage from January 6. 2021.

The House select committee investigating ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN is airing more exclusive footage at 8 p.m. ET on “Anderson Cooper 360”.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has held a series of public hearings in an effort to shed new light on the events of that day and how former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election incited a mob of his supporters to violence.\n\nThe hearings have featured a wide array of information gathered during the investigation that has taken the form of taped clips of interviews conducted by the panel, live testimony from witnesses, and documentary materials.\n\nDuring a hearing on Thursday, which culminated in a vote to subpoena Trump, the committee showed previously unseen footage of congressional leaders on January 6 sheltering and attempting to have federal law enforcement deployed to counter the attack.\n\nCNN obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel. The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the new footage:\n\nSchumer pleads with acting AG to ask Trump to call off rioters\n\nThis clip shows a tense conversation between then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen where Schumer asks Rosen to tell Trump to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol.\n\n“Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol?,” Schumer says. Rosen sidesteps the question, saying instead, “So, uh, as you might guess we’re coordinating as quickly and as” – at which point Schumer jumps in to say, “no, no, no, please answer my question,” before shouting, “answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\nAt the start of the clip, Schumer can be seent shouting at the then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\n“DC has requested the National Guard and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer says. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged … We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nSchumer then hangs up the phone and tells Pelosi who is sitting nearby, “They have not denied it. I spoke to the Secretary of the Army. He’s given the full OK to (inaudible) the National Guard. He said it was not denied.”\n\nPelosi talks about punching Trump\n\nPelosi can be seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nLater, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying “we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden’s win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building. Pence gives Pelosi and Schumer a heads up that law enforcement officials believe the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in “roughly an hour.”\n\nThe video demonstrates how Pence worked to relay information to congressional leaders on the day of the attack. When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, “Good news!”\n\n“They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they’re confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that’s helpful,” Pence says. Pelosi thanks him afterward.\n\nThis clip shows in lengthy detail how the situation at the Capitol escalated on January 6 with rioters swarming the building and eventually breaching it. It shows rioters screaming obscenities directed at a variety of people including law enforcement officers, Pelosi and Pence.\n\nLater Pelosi is seen sheltering with Schumer and other congressional leaders. They pass a phone around with photos of the scene unfolding at the Capitol. “Oh my God. They broke into the Senate chamber,” Schumer says.\n\nA television is turned on showing footage of the attack. “Oh my God, they’re just breaking windows,” Pelosi says, reacting to what she sees on the screen. “It’s just horrendous. All at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nLater, a group of bipartisan congressional leaders huddle around a phone to speak with Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has message of urgency for Miller, saying, “we’re in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\nMiller responds that he got the message, “loud and clear.”\n\nPelosi is later seen speaking with Pence on the phone. She asks him how he’s doing and expresses concern for his safety. “Don’t let anybody know where you are,” she warns.\n\nPelosi, Pence discuss personal safety, contingency plans\n\nPerhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi, Schumer talk with Army secretary\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bused from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-transcripts-detail-numerous-warning-signs-potential-violence-cap-rcna63647', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 transcripts detail numerous warning signs of potential for ...', 'Snippet': 'November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said.

The footage was shot by Pelosi\'s daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, a source familiar told NBC News.\n\n""We have got to get to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,"" Pelosi said to someone, who wasn\'t identified, on her cellphone.\n\n""There has to be some way we can maintain the sense that people have that there is some security or some confidence that government can function and that you can elect the president of the United States,"" Pelosi says later in the clip, with House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., standing next to her.\n\nPelosi was then informed that people who were still on the House floor were putting on tear gas masks to prepare for a breach. ""Do you believe this?"" Pelosi said to Clyburn.\n\nThe next clip showed a crowd of Trump supporters outside what appeared to be Pelosi\'s leadership office near the House floor. ""We\'re coming in if you don\'t bring her out!"" one woman yelled.\n\n""I\'m going to call up the effing secretary of DoD,"" then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, referring to the Department of Defense, while sitting next to Pelosi in another undisclosed room at 3 p.m. The two Democrats were seen calling then-Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller on Schumer\'s flip phone, requesting a ""massive"" response.\n\nThe video also showed Pelosi speaking to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in which she wondered if he could deploy his state\'s National Guard troops to the Capitol. She told Northam that House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was making the same request of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Schumer and Pelosi were also seen on the phone with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen asking for him to get President Donald Trump to call off his supporters.\n\n""Why don’t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility — a public statement they should all leave?"" Schumer said.\n\nOne of the central questions lingering after the attack was why it took so long for National Guard troops to provide the overwhelmed Capitol Police officers with backup. Trump and his allies have repeatedly blamed Pelosi, with Trump telling The Washington Post in April, ""I thought it was a shame, and I kept asking why isn’t she doing something about it? Why isn’t Nancy Pelosi doing something about it? And the mayor of D.C. also. The mayor of D.C. and Nancy Pelosi are in charge.""\n\nThe video from Thursday\'s hearing shows Pelosi and other congressional leaders repeatedly asking for help from law enforcement.\n\nEventually, the video showed Pelosi and Schumer in a room with GOP congressional leaders at the time: Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then the majority leader; House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.; and Senate GOP Whip John Thune, R-S.D.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate Democratic whip, appeared in another clip with leaders.\n\nAt 4:22 p.m., Pelosi was on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who was in a separate secure location. She told Pence that they had spoken to McConnell about expediting the process of certifying the 2020 electoral votes.\n\n""What we are being told very directly is it’s going to take days for the Capitol to be OK again,"" Pelosi told Pence. ""We’ve gotten a very bad report about the condition of the House floor. There’s defecation and all that kind of thing. I don’t think that’s hard to clean up, but I do think it’s more from a security standpoint making sure everybody is out of the building and how long will that take.""\n\nAt 5:59 p.m., Pence spoke with Pelosi and Schumer on the phone and said he was standing with the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police who had just told him that congressional leaders would hear through official channels that the House and Senate would be able to reconvene ""in roughly an hour.""\n\n""Good news,"" Schumer and Pelosi both said.\n\nMembers were seen returning to the Capitol at 7:13 p.m. to finish the process of certifying the 2020 election results.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jan-6-committee-hearing-trump-today/card/pelosi-on-mob-can-you-believe-this--QpJXhGwupo6HopQDbK7c', 'Headline': ""Pelosi on Jan. 6 Mob: 'Do You Believe This?' - The Wall Street Journal"", 'Snippet': 'Video and audio evidence revealed the frantic and alarmed reaction to the assault by congressional leaders and their efforts to restore order.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Wednesday, March 15, 2023. Support NRA-ILA. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64939930', 'Headline': 'Gun control: Biden issues executive order on background checks - BBC', 'Snippet': 'AFP.

""Check whether someone is a violent felon, a domestic abuser, before they buy a gun.""\n\nUniversal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer\'s information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.\n\nThe executive order attempts to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.\n\nMr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.\n\nKris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: ""While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president\'s] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.""\n\nThe executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden spent time with the relatives of victims in the mass shooting in Monterey Park, in the Los Angeles suburbs, and memorialised each one during his remarks.\n\n""We remember and mourn today, but I\'m here with you today to act,"" he said.\n\nHis order calls on the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.\n\nIt also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.\n\nThe president\'s directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over ""red flag"" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/02/us/biden-gun-control-speech', 'Headline': ""Biden's Guns Speech: Biden Calls for Ban on Assault Weapons and New ..."", 'Snippet': ""Biden's Guns Speech Biden Calls for Ban on Assault Weapons and New ‘Red Flag’ Laws. ... The president is turning to a concern of some conservatives in the country. “This isn’t about taking ..."", 'Full_text': '“My God,” he declared from the Cross Hall, a ceremonial part of the White House residence, which was lined with candles in honor of victims of gun violence. “The fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals, even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable. We can’t fail the American people again.”\n\nMr. Biden’s speech came a day after a mass shooting in Tulsa, Okla., that killed four victims and nine days after a massacre in Uvalde, Texas, that took the lives of 19 elementary school children and two teachers. Ten days before that, 10 Black people were gunned down in a grocery store in Buffalo. The list, Mr. Biden said, goes on.\n\n“After Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland — nothing has been done,” he said, lamenting decades of inaction.\n\nWith the 17-minute address, Mr. Biden abruptly shed the reluctance of his White House to engage in what could become yet another fruitless partisan confrontation, played out amid funerals in Uvalde, Buffalo and Tulsa. After weeks of carefully calibrating his calls for action, the president on Thursday did not hold back.\n\n“Enough, enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part,” he told Americans. “For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love.”\n\n“Let’s hear the call and the cry,” he said, almost pleading with his fellow politicians in Washington. “Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.”\n\nWhether that will happen remains unclear. Despite his forceful tone, Mr. Biden all but acknowledged in his speech the political realities that could make him just another in a long line of presidents to have demanded action on guns, only to fail. He called the fight “hard,” and moments after urging a ban on assault weapons, he offered alternatives if that proved to be impossible.\n\n“If we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21, strengthen the background checks,” he said. He called on Congress to “enact safe storage law and red flag laws, repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability, address the mental health crisis.”\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Biden turned his evident cynicism about Republicans into a kind of political threat, saying that “if Congress fails, I believe this time a majority of the American people won’t give up either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote.”\n\nMr. Biden is not a newcomer to the gun debate.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he favors reinstating the ban on assault weapons that he helped pass as a senator and was law for a decade before it expired in 2004. He has called on lawmakers to pass universal background checks for a decade, since 20 children were killed in a shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.\n\nBut both of those measures are seen as highly unlikely to pass in Congress, where fierce Republican opposition has historically stood in their way. Lawmakers in both parties have said recently that they do not believe there is enough bipartisan support to approve either approach.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday advanced a wide-ranging package of gun control legislation that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people under 21 and ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. But those measures, too, were all but certain to die in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats put forward the legislation in response to the killings in Uvalde and the racist massacre in Buffalo — both, the police say, at the hands of 18-year-old gunmen using legally purchased AR-15-style weapons.\n\nA bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee spent Thursday considering the legislation and approved it Thursday evening, on a party-line vote of 25 to 19. Fierce Republican opposition during the committee debate underscored the partisan animosity.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned that another shooting was not far away. He pleaded with Republicans, “My friends, what the hell are you waiting for?”\n\nRepublicans deride such measures as unconstitutional attempts to take guns from law-abiding Americans, robbing them of their right to defend themselves. Representative Dan Bishop, Republican of North Carolina, expressed outrage that Democrats had painted Republicans as complicit in mass shootings, declaring, “You are not going to bully your way into stripping Americans of fundamental rights.”\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said administration officials had been in close touch with lawmakers over the past several days as a bipartisan group of senators discussed a narrower set of limits on gun ownership.\n\nThe negotiations have centered on expanding background checks and providing incentives for states to pass red flag laws, which allow guns to be seized from dangerous people. The group is also looking at proposals on the safe storage of guns at home, community violence and mental health, according to aides and senators involved in the talks.\n\nWith Republicans unanimously opposed to most major gun control measures, the Senate talks offer what is probably the best chance at finding a bipartisan compromise on guns that could pass the 50-to-50 Senate, where 60 votes are needed to break a filibuster and bring legislation to a vote.\n\nBut the endeavor faces long odds, with little evidence that either side is willing to give ground on a debate that has been stalled for years.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is leading the talks for Democrats, joined by his fellow party members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The Republican senators they are huddling with include Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThose nine negotiators met over Zoom on Wednesday to discuss their progress, convening for an hour after days of individual phone calls and smaller meetings with each other and their colleagues. Talks were expected to continue before the Senate returns early next week.\n\n“We are making rapid progress toward a common-sense package that could garner support from both Republicans and Democrats,” Ms. Collins said in a brief statement after the meeting.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, a top ally to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also been involved in discussions, including a Tuesday meeting with Mr. Murphy, Ms. Sinema and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina.\n\nDemocratic leaders have warned that if an agreement cannot be reached quickly, they will force votes on the bills in the House, which do not have Republican support, to demonstrate for Americans which lawmakers are standing in the way of passing gun safety measures.\n\n“I’m cleareyed about the history of failure,” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting. “But if there’s ever a moment to put up or shut up, this one is it.”\n\nIn the days immediately after the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings, both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris largely stayed away from any direct negotiations with lawmakers about how to create a response to the shootings that can pass in Congress.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Biden abandoned that approach, deciding instead to lay down a marker that will cement his legacy as a president who fought for tougher gun laws, successful or not.\n\nIn his speech on Thursday, Mr. Biden described the deep grief that he experienced when he and his wife talked to the families of victims in the two mass shootings.\n\n“At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members, who were broken, whose lives will never be the same,” he said. “They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.”\n\n“How much more carnage are we willing to accept?” he asked. “How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say: Enough. Enough.”\n\nAnd he made the target of his comment clear, saying it now falls to Congress to pass the far-reaching laws it has refused to in the past.\n\n“The question now is: What will the Congress do?” he said. The president said he supported the efforts by the bipartisan group in the Senate to find a compromise, but called it the least lawmakers should do.\n\nThe approach Thursday night was more like the response from former President Barack Obama in January 2013, just weeks after the shooting at the school in Newtown.\n\nMr. Obama, flanked by Mr. Biden, who was then the vice president, proposed a package of gun control measures, including: ensuring that all gun owners go through a background check; improving state reporting of criminals and the mentally ill; banning assault weapons; and capping magazine clip capacity at 10 bullets.\n\nIn the face of Republican opposition, Mr. Obama dropped his demand for an assault weapon ban and limits on the size of magazine clips. After months of pushing by Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, the Senate rejected a bipartisan effort to expand background checks.\n\nIn scathing comments after the bill died, Mr. Obama derided senators for deciding that the lives of children were not worth the effort to pass legislation. A decade later, Mr. Obama’s grim assessment stands as a warning for Mr. Biden of what might happen again.\n\n“All in all,” Mr. Obama said at the time, “this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.”\n\nEmily Cochrane , Catie Edmondson and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nThe day before, we visited Uvalde — Uvalde, Texas. In front of Robb Elementary School, we stood before 21 crosses, for 19 third and fourth graders and two teachers. On each cross, a name.\n\nAnd nearby, a photo of each victim, that Jill and I reached out to touch. Innocent victims, murdered in a classroom that had been turned into a killing field. Standing there in that small town, like so many other communities across America, I couldn’t help but think there are too many other schools, too many other everyday places that have become killing fields, battlefields, here in America.\n\nWe stood in such a place just 12 days before, across from a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, memorializing 10 fellow Americans — a spouse, a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, gone forever. At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members who were broken, and whose lives will never be the same. They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.\n\nAfter Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland, nothing has been done. This time, that can’t be true. This time, we must actually do something. The issue we face is one of conscience and common sense.\n\nFor so many of you at home, I want to be very clear. This is not about taking away anyone’s guns. It’s not about vilifying gun owners. In fact, we believe we should be treating responsible gun owners as an example of how every gun owner should behave.\n\nI respect the culture and the tradition and the concerns of lawful gun owners. At the same time, the Second Amendment, like all other rights, is not absolute. It was Justice Scalia who wrote, and I quote: “Like most rights, the right Second Amendment — the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited.” Not unlimited. It never has been.\n\nThere have always been limitations on what weapons you can own in America. For example, machine guns have been federally regulated for nearly 90 years, and this is still a free country. This isn’t about taking away anyone’s rights. It’s about protecting children. It’s about protecting families. It’s about protecting whole communities. It’s about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to a church, without being shot and killed.\n\nAccording to new data just released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guns are the No. 1 killer of children in the United States of America. The No. 1 killer. More than car accidents, more than cancer. Over the last two decades, more school-age children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined.\n\nThink about that. More kids than on-duty cops killed by guns. More kids than soldiers killed by guns. For God’s sake. How much more carnage are we willing to accept? How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say enough? Enough.\n\nI know that we can’t prevent every tragedy, but here’s what I believe we have to do. Here’s what the overwhelming majority of the American people believe we must do. Here’s what the families in Buffalo and Uvalde, in Texas, told us we must do.\n\nWe need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. And if we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21. Strengthen the background checks, enact safe storage laws and “red flag” laws. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. Address the mental health crisis deepening the trauma of gun violence, and as a consequence of that violence.\n\nThese are rational, common-sense measures. Here’s what it all means. It all means this: We should reinstate the assault weapons ban on high capacity magazines that we passed in 1994 with bipartisan support in Congress and the support of law enforcement.\n\nNine categories of semiautomatic weapons were included in that ban, like AK-47s and AR-15s. And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down. But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.\n\nA few years ago, the family of the inventor of the AR-15 said he would have been horrified to know his design was being used to slaughter children and other innocent lives instead of being used as a military weapon on the battlefields, as it was designed. That’s what it was designed for.\n\nEnough, enough. We should limit how many rounds a weapon can hold. Why in God’s name should an ordinary citizen be able to purchase an assault weapon that holds 30-round magazines that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes? The damage was so devastating in Uvalde parents had to do DNA swabs to identify the remains of their children. Nine- and 10-year-old children.\n\nEnough. We should expand background checks to keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitives and those under restraining orders. Stronger background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, agree on.\n\nI also believe we should have safe storage laws, and personal liability for not locking up your gun. The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns. They were too easy to access. That’s how he got the weapons. The weapon he used to kill his mother, and then murder 26 people, including 20 first graders.\n\nIf you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it. Every responsible gun owner agrees. To make sure no one else can have access to it. To lock it up. To have trigger locks. And if you don’t, and something bad happens, you should be held responsible.\n\nWe should also have national red flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates or experiencing suicidal thoughts — it makes them a danger to themselves or to others. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws. The Delaware law is named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\nFort Hood, Texas, 2009. Thirteen dead and more than 30 injured. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., 2018. Seventeen dead, 17 injured. In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds. Red flag laws could have stopped both these shooters.\n\nIn Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused. But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon, even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21.\n\nIf we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21. Look, I know some folks will say 18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons, but that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.\n\nWe should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons. They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.\n\nImagine. Imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued, where we’d be today. The gun industry’s special protections are outrageous. It must end.\n\nAnd let there be no mistake about the psychological trauma that gun violence leaves behind. Imagine being that little girl, that brave little girl in Uvalde, who smeared blood off her murdered friend’s body onto her own face, to lie still among the corpses in her classroom and pretend she was dead in order to stay alive. Imagine. Imagine what it would be like for her to walk down the hallway of any school again.\n\nImagine what it’s like for children who experience this kind of trauma every day in school, on the streets, in communities all across America. Imagine what it’s like for so many parents to hug their children goodbye in the morning, not sure whether they’ll come back home. Unfortunately, too many people don’t have to imagine that at all.\n\nEven before the pandemic, young people were already hurting. There’s a serious youth mental health crisis in this country. We have to do something about it. That’s why mental health is the heart of my unity agenda that I laid out in the State of the Union address this year.\n\nWe must provide more school counselors; more school nurses; more mental health services for students and for teachers. More people volunteering as mentors to help young people succeed. More privacy protection and resources to keep kids safe from the harms of social media.\n\nThis unity agenda won’t fully heal the wounded souls, but it will help. It matters.\n\nI just told you what I’d do. The question now is: What will the congress do?\n\nThe House of Representatives already passed key measures we need: Expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun sales, including at gun shows and online sales. Getting rid of a loophole that allows a gun sale to go through after three business days, even if the background check has not been completed.\n\nAnd the House is planning even more action next week. Safe storage requirements. The banning of high-capacity magazines. Raising the age to buy an assault weapon to 21. Federal red flag law. Codifying my ban on ghost guns that don’t have serial numbers and can’t be traced. And tougher laws to prevent gun trafficking and straw purchases.\n\nThis time, we have to take the time to do something. And this time, it’s time for the Senate to do something.\n\nBut, as we know, in order to get anything done in the Senate, we need a minimum of 10 Republican senators. I support the bipartisan efforts that include a small group of Democrats and Republican senators trying to find a way. But my God. The fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable.\n\nWe can’t fail the American people again. Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday, at a hospital in Tulsa, Okla. A shooter deliberately targeted a surgeon using an assault weapon he bought just a few hours before his rampage that left a surgeon, another doctor, a receptionist and a patient dead, and many more injured. That doesn’t count the carnage we see every single day that doesn’t make the headlines.\n\nI’ve been in this fight for a long time. I know how hard it is, but I’ll never give up. And if Congress fails, I believe this time, a majority of the American people won’t give up, either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote. Enough, enough, enough.\n\nOver the next 17 days, the families in Uvalde will continue burying their dead. It will take that long, in part, because it’s a town where everyone knows everyone, and day by day they will honor each one they lost. Jill and I met with the owner and staff of the funeral home, who was being strong, strong, strong to take care of their own. And the people of Uvalde mourned, as they do over the next 17 days. What will we be doing as a nation?\n\nJill and I met with the sister of the teacher who was murdered and whose husband died of a heart attack two days later, leaving behind four beautiful, orphaned children. All now orphans.\n\nThe sister asked us: What could she say? What could she tell her nieces and nephews? The most heartbreaking moments that I can remember. All I could think to say was, I told her to hold them tight. Hold them tight.\n\nAfter visiting the school, we attended Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church with Father Eddy. In the pews, family and friends held each other tightly. As Archbishop Gustavo spoke, he asked the children in attendance to come up on the altar and sit in the altar with him, as he spoke. There wasn’t enough room, so a mom and her young son sat next to Jill and me in the first pew.\n\nAnd as we left the church, a grandmother who had just lost her granddaughter passed me a handwritten letter. It read, quote: “Erase the invisible line that is dividing our nation. Come up with a solution and fix what’s broken and make the changes that are necessary to prevent this happening again.” End of quote.\n\nMy fellow Americans, enough. Enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part. It’s time to act. For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love. Let’s hear the call and the cry. Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.\n\nGod bless the families who are hurting. God bless you all. From a hymn based in the 91st Psalm, sung in my church: “May he raise you up on eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn. Make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand.”\n\nThat’s my prayer for all of you. God bless you.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence. However, to fully address this problem, Congress must act.', 'Full_text': 'In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Attorney General to move as close to universal background checks as possible within existing law. Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called “fire sale loophole.”\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to “predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole” or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.\n\n###'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'Reporting from Washington.

The new rule will go through the federal rulemaking process.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday that the move is a result of the bipartisan law passed by Congress last year.\n\n“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was passed by Congress to reduce gun violence, including by expanding the background checks that keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said. “This proposed rule implements Congress’s mandate to expand the definition of who must obtain a license and conduct a background check before selling firearms.”\n\nThe ""gun show loophole"" has been cited for years as a major hole in the federal background check system, allowing a vast number of private sales without background checks. The ATF currently licenses about 80,000 brick-and-mortar gun dealers, but gun sales are increasingly taking place outside that system, free of background checks.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signed an executive order designed to expand background checks. It directed Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, an authority an administration official said was detailed in the bipartisan gun law.\n\nNBC News reported last year about some of the provisions of the law that led to Thursday\'s proposed rule. At the time, however, sources close to the negotiations behind the legislation tempered expectations that it could close the gun show loophole or have a significant effect on the sale of guns online, although they hoped it would bolster enforcement and oversight of the firearms market.\n\nThe sources said they had in mind the shooter in Midland-Odessa, Texas, who killed eight people in 2019 with a gun that he bought through a private sale. He had previously failed a background check from a licensed gun seller and was not allowed to buy a weapon.\n\nBiden touted the bipartisan legislation in June, a year after he signed it into law, saying that it was already saving lives.\n\nThe president said the law has allowed the Justice Department to run enhanced background checks through the FBI on adults under 21 who try to buy firearms. It has also provided funding to states to expand the so-called red flag laws that allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. And it has provided money to states to boost mental health services, especially for young people. Biden also noted that the law closed the so-called boyfriend loophole by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.\n\nBiden has long made it a priority to enact policies focused on curbing gun violence. He and then-President Barack Obama attempted to push Congress to pass such measures, and the closest it came was in 2013, a few months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The Senate fell six votes short of advancing a bill by Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would have required background checks in all commercial gun sales.\n\nSince becoming president, while still pressuring Congress to pass legislation, Biden has also used his executive authority to try to reduce gun violence, although he faces limits. He has repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass another assault weapons ban in the wake of several mass shootings.\n\nThere\'s little chance of such a measure passing through both chambers of Congress. Republicans narrowly control the House, and Democrats have a thin majority in the Senate, meaning they would need substantial Republican support to overcome a filibuster.'}}",93.33333333333333,1

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/13/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-to-increase-transparency.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership.

Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken historic actions to deliver on the President’s call to action and ensure seniors and people with disabilities get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve.\n\nToday, in a continued effort to deliver on the President’s commitment, HHS announced additional action to increase the transparency of nursing home ownership and management. The Department issued a proposed rule to require nursing homes to disclose to CMS and states additional ownership and management information. The rule also includes private equity and real estate investment trust definitions, setting the stage for the disclosure of whether nursing home owners are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. The proposal marks an important step in continuing to implement President Biden’s initiative to improve the quality and care available at nursing homes. By making facility ownership and oversight more transparent, nursing home residents and their families will be more empowered to make informed decisions about care.\n\n“President Biden has made clear: improving our nation’s nursing homes is an urgent priority, and this Administration is not afraid to take bold action to tackle this head-on,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are continuing our unprecedented efforts to increase nursing home ownership transparency – because it’s what the public deserves. We are pursuing all avenues to shine a light on this industry. We will keep doing everything we can to ensure all Americans receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve.”\n\n“CMS is committed to using every tool at our disposal to improve nursing home care and identify trends that enhance residents’ quality of life,” CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “If finalized, this rule would strengthen our ability to examine ownership types, including private equity and real estate investment trusts.”\n\nThe proposed rule would implement portions of Section 6101(a) of the Affordable Care Act. This would require nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes would disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or support, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. The proposed rule would also require additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nIn addition to the Section 6101(a) disclosures, the proposed rule would provide definitions of “private equity company” and “real estate investment trust” to assist nursing homes when reporting this data.\n\nThese key definitions will lead to the disclosure of whether direct and indirect nursing home owners are private equity companies or real estate investment trusts via an updated nursing home enrollment application expected to be ready for public use in the summer of 2023.Concerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a 17-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership. Another study found that private equity-backed nursing homes had a COVID-19 infection rate and death rate that were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that private equity ownership of nursing homes may lead to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule would be publicly reported pursuant to section 6101(b) of the Affordable Care Act. This transparency will, among other things, allow families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones, and it will enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nThese new data and analysis support President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of improving transparency around nursing facility ownership and improve competition of the overall industry. Greater transparency will help both the Administration and external parties better understand how the nursing home market is changing and whether the market is becoming more concentrated, which could potentially disrupt market competition and affect quality of care. For example, data analysis has shown:\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership. The number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016.\n\nThe largest 10 nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes—a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nNursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecently published research has found that in the 2-3 years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%.\n\nToday’s proposed rule builds on the Department’s historic releases of data and unprecedented efforts to increase transparency. In April 2022, CMS released data publicly – for the first time ever – on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership from 2016-2022 for hospitals and nursing homes enrolled in Medicare. In September 2022, CMS released additional data publicly on the ownership of approximately 15,000 nursing homes certified as a Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility, regardless of any change in ownership, including providing more information about organizational owners of nursing homes. In December 2022, CMS released ownership data publicly — for the first time ever — for all Medicare-certified hospitals.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care ...', 'Snippet': 'To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety ...', 'Full_text': ""All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and to have access to quality medical care. The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists. CMS will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these requirements to help improve resident health and safety.\n\nEnhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness. Both the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the next weather-related emergencies.\n\nIntegrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements. The pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and other areas, using an equity lens.\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/15/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home-ownership.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Final rule will require disclosure of new information to shine a light on private equity ownership.

Today’s final rule includes definitions of private equity and real estate investment trusts, setting the stage for identifying whether a nursing home belongs to one of these types of owners. These actions continue to build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to improving the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes and President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Earlier this year, CMS and HHS also proposed a rule in September to establish national minimum staffing standards for nursing homes to enhance the quality and safety of care.\n\n“HHS continues to take action to improve the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing homes,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that residents living in nursing homes should receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. Taking steps to help consumers to learn more about the owners of a nursing home will allow them to make the choice that best meets their needs.”\n\n“CMS is committed to leveraging our tools to improve safety and quality of care in nursing homes, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “By strengthening our ability to examine nursing home ownership, including private equity and real estate investment trusts, we can improve transparency for the people we serve and their loved ones, researchers, and regulators, and enable better informed decisions about nursing home care.”\n\nThe final rule requires nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding their owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes will disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes. Nursing homes will also be required to disclose entities that exercise financial control over the facility, such as an organization the nursing home hires to manage all of its financial matters.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or supports within a facility, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. That will change under this rule. The final rule also requires additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nConcerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011, and the sector continues to attract robust sales.\n\nThe number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016, generously outpacing that of hospitals. Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership – four times more than hospitals. Nursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes, and in the two to three years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%. Private equity ownership of nursing homes may also lead to an uptick in Medicare costs. Additionally, the 10 largest nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes — a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule will be public, allowing families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones. This will also enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nFor a fact sheet on the final nursing home ownership disclosure rule, visit: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/disclosures-ownership-and-additional-disclosable-parties-information-skilled-nursing-facilities-and-0\n\nFor the ASPE report on nursing home ownership and quality trends, visit:\n\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/nh-ownership-its-implications-quality-availability-care.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Announces New Steps to ...', 'Snippet': 'Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer.', 'Full_text': ""For far too long, nursing home residents have been victims of an industry with little accountability to keep American seniors safe and protected. COVID-19 has laid bare the challenges in America’s nursing homes, with over 200,000 residents and staff dying from COVID-19. That’s why in his State of the Union, President Biden launched an action plan to improve the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to increase accountability of bad actors in the nursing home industry, improve the quality of nursing homes and make them safer. These efforts complement the Administration’s investments in home and community-based services to prevent unnecessary nursing home admissions and help nursing home residents transition back home when possible.\n\nMore Aggressive Enforcement for the Worst-Performing Nursing Homes\n\nToday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced new actions to significantly strengthen accountability for nursing homes in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, an oversight program for the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The SFF Program already provides more frequent inspections of these nursing homes, but more action is needed to ensure these nursing homes improve.\n\nThe SFF Program reforms announced for the first time today:\n\nIncrease penalties for nursing homes in the program that fail to improve: CMS will, effective immediately, begin using escalating penalties for violations, including considering facilities with citations for dangerous violations in two successive inspections for termination from Medicare and/or Medicaid funding.\n\nIncrease safety standards for improvement: Under today’s changes, CMS is increasing the requirements that nursing homes in the SFF Program must meet to be successful and graduate from the program. Even after a facility graduates from the program, CMS will now continue close scrutiny of the facility for at least 3 years—helping ensure these nursing homes consistently maintain compliance with safety requirements.\n\nIncrease technical assistance: CMS is also increasing its engagement with these poor-performing nursing homes, through direct and immediate outreach by CMS officials upon their selection as an SFF, to help them understand how to improve and to access support resources like CMS Quality Improvement Organizations.\n\nMore Resources to Support Good-Paying, Union Jobs in Nursing Home Care\n\nSufficient, high-quality staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality-of-care residents receive. Creating good-paying, union jobs in the nursing home industry—and career pathways into those jobs—promotes the “double dignity” of both patients and workers. That’s why today the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Department of Labor (“DOL”) are highlighting funds that are newly available to support pathways into good-quality nursing jobs—including for the nursing home workforce:\n\nA wide variety of workforce stakeholders can apply for $80 million in grant funding available right now: Now through January 6, nonprofit healthcare organizations, industry organizations or trade groups, labor unions, labor management organizations, education and training providers, workforce development entities, and Native American Tribal Governments can apply for the DOL’s Nursing Expansion Grant program, which will provide $80 million in grants to help address bottlenecks in training the U.S. nursing workforce and expand and diversify the pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. Specifically, these funds will help: 1) increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators, and 2) train frontline healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance along a career pathway and attain recognized postsecondary credentials, including Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Nurses. This program will emphasize training those from historically marginalized and underrepresented populations, which helps to address the growing health equity gap in medically underserved communities.\n\nHHS is announcing $13 million in grants to expand nursing education and training: These funds made available through the Health Resources and Services Administration will help expand the number of nursing preceptors—experienced licensed clinicians who supervise nursing students during their clinical rotations. Expanding preceptors will help support the goal of nursing schools admitting more students by providing more opportunities for well-supported clinical rotations and, ultimately, career paths.\n\nHHS and DOL will provide opportunities to apply for additional federal funds to support the nursing workforce pipeline: HHS and DOL have identified hundreds of millions of dollars in funds coming online over the next year to help improve nurse staffing and workforce sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration encourages eligible entities to braid these programs to attract and retain high-quality workers to serve in healthcare professions such as nursing aides, home health aides, and registered nurses:\n\nBy the end of this year, DOL’s Employment and Training Administration’s (ETA’s) YouthBuild will make available approximately $90 million in grant funding for eligible nonprofit organizations or consortia eligible to provide education or employment training under a Federal program, in order to provide job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth, with over one-third of recent grantees offering healthcare-related training.\n\nOn a rolling basis, ETA’s National Dislocated Worker Grants program makes tens of millions or more in grant funding available to eligible States, outlying areas designated by the Governor, and organizations eligible for funding through the Native American Programs to develop training in entry-level nursing occupations such as Certified Nursing Assistant, Medical Assisting, and Physical Therapy. These funds help develop training after major economic dislocations, such as plant closures, mass layoffs, or higher-than-average demand for employment and training activities for dislocated members of the Armed Forces and their spouses—with approximately three-quarters of grantees connecting participants to careers in healthcare.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, ETA’s WORC Initiative Grants will make available up to $35 million in grants to eligible State Government, County Government, City or Township Government, Special District Government, Regional Organization, Independent School District, Public/State Controlled Institution of Higher Education, Private Institution of Higher Education, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian/Native American Tribal Governments. These grant funds enable impacted communities to develop local and regional workforce development solutions aligned with existing economic development strategies and community partnerships to promote new, sustainable job opportunities and long-term economic vitality, all to support dislocated workers, new entrants to the workforce, and incumbent workers for good jobs in high-demand occupations including behavioral health, dental health, and health IT.\n\nBuilding On Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s efforts build on the many other actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to improve nursing home quality and accountability since President Biden announced the Nursing Home Reform Action Plan in the State of the Union:\n\nEstablishing minimum staffing requirements: CMS launched a public input process and research study that will inform future rulemaking on a minimum staffing requirement, and the proposed rule is on track for release by Spring 2023.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection: CMS is working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to crack down on nursing homes that illegally hold families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nIncreasing transparency & accountability: CMS made available more data on who owns Medicare-certified nursing homes, helping empower families who are comparison shopping to understand whether a nursing home is part of a bad chain. CMS also released data publicly—for the first time—on mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and changes of ownership for nursing homes and hospitals enrolled in Medicare.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding: CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2023, including a nearly billion dollar payment increase and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. CMS also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for nursing home residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention efforts—i.e., to tie Medicaid payments to measures of safety and quality of care.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop: CMS launched its enhanced Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System, integrating data on nursing homes’ weekend staffing rates for nurses and information on annual turnover among nurses and administrators. The updated Star Ratings increase transparency to make it easier for families to comparison shop to find the reliable, quality care their loved ones deserve.\n\nPreventing fraudsters from receiving Medicare funds: CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks to be eligible for Medicare funds, preventing abuse and Medicare fraud by nursing home owners.\n\nEnsuring pandemic preparedness: CMS updated its guidance to nursing home inspectors, including, among other things, requiring infection control specialists to be on site—not just off-site consultants as the prior Administration allowed.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/op-ed-the-president-nursing-homes', 'Headline': 'Op-Ed by the President on Nursing Homes', 'Snippet': ""September 01, 2023.

We\'re ending the abuse today.\n\n[President Joe Biden, 9/1/23]\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nIt\'s one of the most gut-wrenching moments American families face: when a loved one can no longer be cared for at home and needs to move into a nursing home. You lie awake at night wondering: will they receive the care and support they need? How can you be sure they\'ll be safe? Are you doing the right thing?\n\nUnfortunately, too many Americans across the country know firsthand how hard it can be to find a nursing home that provides that peace of mind. A woman in Texas, who has changed nursing facilities three times in four years over concerns about care, wrote to me, ""we keep looking for someplace that will fulfill the promises they make when you\'re admitted."" A daughter in New York, whose mother is in a facility, wrote ""it keeps me up at night, when there\'s half of what\'s needed"" to keep her mom safe.\n\nDespite nursing homes receiving nearly $100 billion annually from American taxpayers, too many facilities are understaffed, which can result in severe illness and even death for residents. Those vulnerabilities were exposed during the pandemic, when more than 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died from COVID-19. And in recent years, more private-equity firms have been buying up nursing homes and slashing key staff to cut costs and make bigger profits, endangering the safety of their residents in the process.\n\nIn my State of the Union address, I pledged to crack down on nursing homes that put the well-being of their residents at risk. Today, here\'s how my administration is following through on this commitment to ensure every nursing home is safe for every resident, and residents get the care they deserve.\n\nWe\'re proposing minimum staffing requirements for every taxpayer-funded nursing home. Under our new proposed standards, every nursing facility would have to provide a registered nurse on site 24/7 and have enough nurses and nurse aides to provide routine bedside care, among other tasks. Research shows that these staffing levels will save lives, provide residents with a higher quality of life and prevent needless suffering.\n\nThink of it this way: we are working to make sure no nursing home can sacrifice the safety of their residents just to add some dollars to their bottom line. It\'s telling that non-profit nursing homes are three times as likely as for-profit facilities to already satisfy the minimum staffing standard we\'re proposing today. Some corporate nursing home owners are taking taxpayer dollars while cutting corners on staffing so they can make big payouts to executives and shareholders. It\'s wrong.\n\nWe\'re also supporting the folks who are doing God\'s work – the nursing staff who care for so many of our loved ones, but who are over-worked and under-resourced. Nursing home staff describe getting burnt out when they have too many residents to care for in too little time. Many end up leaving the industry. Minimum staffing standards would help them stay in the jobs they love. And we\'re doing our part.\n\nToday, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing a new $75 million investment, on top of hundreds of millions of dollars already committed, to recruit, train and retain nurses and other caregivers.\n\nThese announcements are the latest in my administration\'s effort to make nursing homes safer and to make sure taxpayer dollars are well spent. We\'ve increased transparency and accountability for nursing home owners, gone after fraud and abuse and more. We also remain focused on supporting high quality care at home. That\'s why in April, I signed an executive order to support caregivers, building on prior actions and investments in home and community-based care.\n\nAs a country, we\'re delivering a clear message to the nursing home industry: no more padding profits on the backs of residents and nurses. If you tell families you\'ll take care of their loved ones, then follow through.\n\nThat\'s how we build a long-term care system where loved ones can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive the care they need in the setting of their choice and where there is a pipeline of health care workers into good-paying jobs – that include the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\nFor all you facing that most gut-wrenching of moments, you and your loved ones deserve nothing less than peace of mind and dignity. I have your back.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/politics/biden-to-launch-ambitious-overhaul-of-nursing-home-quality/2771604/', 'Headline': 'Biden to Launch Ambitious Overhaul of Nursing Home Quality', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden will launch a major overhaul of nursing home quality in his State of the Union speech, White House officials said Monday, outlining a series of measures long sought by ...', 'Full_text': ""President Joe Biden will launch a major overhaul of nursing home quality in his State of the Union speech, White House officials said Monday, outlining a series of measures long sought by advocates and opposed by the industry.\n\nTaken together, the more than 20 separate steps would raise the bar on staffing and quality, increase government oversight, continue efforts to keep COVID-19 out of nursing homes, and shine a spotlight on a growing trend toward investor-owned, for-profit facilities.\n\nOne major missing element: New sources of federal financing to pay for the ambitious upgrade.\n\n“Overall these are very positive developments,” said Harvard health policy professor David Grabowksi, who tracks long-term care. “If you ask the industry, they'll tell you this will put them out of business. If you ask an advocate, they'll say there's plenty of money in the system. I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.”\n\nNursing home residents represent a disproportionate share of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic, and the Biden administration has also been working to develop home- and community-based care as an alternative.\n\nThe cornerstone of Biden's nursing home plan is a new requirement for minimum staffing standards. He's ordering the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to conduct a study on staffing and publish proposed regulations within a year.\n\nExperts say staffing levels are the single most important marker for nursing home quality, and many facilities lack sufficient numbers of nurses, nursing assistants and other workers involved in providing direct care to patients. The coronavirus pandemic has led to many workers leaving the industry, even as nursing homes raised wages, so a new federal staffing requirement may take time to put into place.\n\nLawmakers in Congress have been debating legislation to require minimum staffing standards for facilities that accept payment from Medicare and Medicaid, as virtually all do. The original plan was to include staffing requirements in Biden's domestic agenda bill, but with that legislation stalled the administration seems to be shifting to using its regulatory powers to bring about changes.\n\nBiden's plan also calls for moving nursing homes toward private rooms for their residents, directing federal regulators to explore how to phase out living arrangements that house three or more residents in the same room.\n\n“Despite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, substandard care that leads to avoidable resident harm,” said a White House policy document that outlined Biden's plan.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the major nursing home industry groups.\n\nBeefed-up oversight is another priority for Biden. His plan calls for increasing the nursing home inspection budget by $500 million, a boost of nearly 25%. Nursing home inspections are generally carried out by the states, following guidelines from Medicare. Biden is planning to revamp a special inspection program that focuses on low-performing facilities, to raise fines on nursing homes that fail to improve and, if necessary, cut off Medicare and Medicaid payments.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the problems of nursing homes, a neglected part of the health care system. More than 200,000 residents and staff of long-term care facilities have died, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. While nursing home residents and staff account for a tiny share of the U.S. population, they have accounted for more than 1 in 5 deaths.\n\nBiden's plan calls for the government to keep a focus on vaccinating and boosting nursing home residents and staff, along with regular testing. While the omicron wave saw increased cases and deaths in nursing homes, facilities were largely spared a repeat of last winter's grim experience.\n\nWith infection control considered a chronic problem at many facilities, Biden is directing Medicare to strengthen requirements that the nursing homes employ on-site infection prevention specialists.\n\nMore than half of the nation's nursing homes are owned by for-profit companies, and the administration wants to shine a spotlight on a growing trend of private equity firms snapping up ownership of facilities.\n\nThe White House said the private equity stake in the industry grew from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion by 2018.\n\n“Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people, a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities,” the White House policy document said.\n\nOfficials said federal agencies will be directed to examine the role of private equity investors in the nursing home industry “and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents' best interests.”\n\nAdvocates were cheered by the White House announcement.\n\n“This plan is a major step forward for quality and safety in our nation’s nursing homes,” said Terry Fulmer, president of the nonprofit John A. Hartford Foundation, which works to improve long-term care. “It will be essential that it get implemented quickly and monitored closely for the improvements we need now.”""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2022/changes-to-medicare-services-retirement-requirements-congress-deciding.html', 'Headline': 'Retirees, Medicare Enrollees Will Benefit From Spending Plan ... - AARP', 'Snippet': 'Older Americans willl be better able to save and plan for their retirement and have more options for getting Medicare services at home under a sweeping 2023 spending bill President Joe Biden signed into law on Dec. 29.

The legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Dec. 23 by a vote of 225-201 with one member voting ""present."" The measure had passed the U. S. Senate on Dec. 22 by a 68 to 29 vote.\n\n“Older Americans, like Americans of all ages, want elected officials to work together to ensure their health and financial security,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, says in a statement.\n\n“AARP is pleased that the bipartisan government funding bill addresses important priorities for Americans age 50-plus, including increasing Social Security Administration funding, making it easier to save for retirement and extending critical Medicare benefits.”\n\nHere’s a look at some elements of the law that address the financial and health needs of older adults:\n\nSocial Security\n\nThe spending law includes $14.1 billion for the Social Security Administration (SSA), an increase of $785 million, or 6 percent, from the previous fiscal year.\n\nAARP had called on Congress to fully fund the administration’s $14.8 billion budget request, which the SSA says it needs to begin reversing a crisis in customer service that older Americans and people with disabilities are feeling after years of funding cuts and staff losses at the agency.\n\nThe average wait time for someone calling Social Security’s national phone line has more than doubled in the past year, reaching 34 minutes, and processing claims for disability benefits takes twice as long on average as it did a decade ago, according to SSA data.\n\n“Funding for the Social Security Administration has steadily eroded over the past decade, while the number of people it serves has grown,” LeaMond says. “The higher funding included in this legislation is a needed step to begin to address this customer service crisis, but more must be done.”\n\nRetirement savings\n\nThe new law includes a package of provisions collectively called SECURE 2.0 that will expand workers’ access to retirement plans and older Americans’ ability to contribute to and maintain such accounts. AARP strongly backed the package, which builds on changes to retirement savings adopted in a 2019 bill called the SECURE Act (Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement).\n\n“While Social Security is the bedrock of retirement income for American workers, individuals want and need additional retirement income,” LeaMond says.\n\nAmong other things, SECURE 2.0 will:\n\nReplace the Saver’s Credit, a tax break that can reduce tax bills for low- and moderate-income earners who contribute to qualified retirement plans, with a federal matching contribution of up to $1,000 and make it available to more taxpayers, starting in 2027.\n\nRequire most employers that offer new 401(k) or 403(b) plans to automatically enroll their employeees, and to annually increase their contribution level, unless the employee opts out. This will begin in 2025. Auto-enrollment more than triples participation in workplace retirement plans, a 2021 Vanguard study found.\n\nRequire employers to allow part-time workers to join a retirement plan within two years of being hired, rather than having to wait the current three, starting in 2025.\n\nIncrease from 72 to 75 the age at which individuals must start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts. The change will be phased in from 2023 to 2033.\n\nRaise limits on catch-up contributions to 401(k) and 403(b) accounts for people ages 60 to 63, starting in 2025.\n\nProvide annual paper statements to workers enrolled in retirement plans, detailing the state of their account and prospective benefit. Companies will still be able to provide electronic statements.\n\nEstablish a national lost and found database for retirement accounts to help ensure people don’t lose track of money in plans tied to past employers.\n\nHealth care\n\n“The budget package extends several pandemic-era provisions for people on Medicare,” LeaMond says. “These provisions will help many older adults access medical care more easily.”\n\nTelehealth: The spending package will extend for two years — until the end of 2024 — the expansions to telehealth medicine that were put in place in Medicare during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBefore the coronavirus hit, Medicare coverage for telehealth was limited, available mainly to people in rural areas for whom getting to a doctor’s appointment was difficult. In March 2020, these virtual visits were made available to all Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, Medicare expanded the types of providers that could get paid for telehealth sessions, enabling nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists and licensed clinical social workers to “see” Medicare patients remotely.\n\nThe telehealth changes in the spending law will also allow Medicare enrollees to have remote visits either via video or telephone. Before the pandemic, telehealth visits had to include video, which made it difficult for some beneficiaries with limited or no broadband access.\n\nHospital at home: The bill would extend a decision by Medicare to allow hospitals to treat some patients — including some who would ordinarily be seen in emergency rooms — in their homes instead of admitting them to a hospital.\n\nThis effort began in November 2020, when COVID-19 cases were flooding the nation’s hospitals. It was designed to free up hospital bed space and protect older Americans from being exposed to the virus. Under the spending package, this hospital-at-home expansion will continue through the end of 2024.\n\nBehavioral health: Beginning in 2024, Medicare will increase the number and types of providers the program covers to treat behavioral and mental health disorders. In addition to reimbursing marriage and family therapists and licensed professional counselors, the spending measure provides coverage for intensive outpatient behavioral health services.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/bidens-crackdown-on-junk-fees-in-retirement-plans', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Crackdown on Junk Fees in Retirement Plans - U.S. News', 'Snippet': 'Retirement advisors specialize in the life events that happen after retirement. Coryanne Hicks Jan. 7, 2021 Tags: retirement , money , hidden fees , financial advisors , Joe Biden , consumers', 'Full_text': ""As part of its initiative to curb junk fees, the Biden administration is setting its sights on retirement plans.\n\nIn October, the Department of Labor proposed a rule aimed at closing loopholes and requiring financial advisors to provide retirement advice in the best interest of clients. It would expand on the current fiduciary standard that covers advice related to purchasing securities to include types of nonsecurities, affecting recommendations for IRA rollovers and advice to retirement plan sponsors and employers.\n\nThe initiative also aims to reduce junk fees in retirement products such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s. To understand President Joe Biden’s crackdown on junk fees, consider:\n\nHow much Americans pay in junk fees.\n\nWhat the proposal to crack down on junk fees includes.\n\nHow the rule would impact the financial industry.\n\nWhat you can do to avoid junk fees.\n\nBest practices to work with a financial advisor.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhere to Look for Junk Fees\n\nHow Much Americans Pay in Junk Fees\n\nWhen retirement advisors meet with consumers, they often make suggestions about investment products. Some firms pay their financial advisors a higher commission for recommending certain options over others, which could lead them to recommend an investment product that isn’t in the best interest of the saver.\n\nThis creates a conflict of interest, and consumers could lose out on investment earnings if they choose products that are not suited to their situation. For instance, the Biden Administration points to research from the White House Council of Economic Advisers that says conflicts of interest surrounding the sale of fixed index annuities could lead savers to collectively lose as much as $5 billion a year.\n\nWhat the Proposal to Crack Down on Junk Fees Includes\n\nThe rule, part of a broad effort by the Biden administration to slash junk fees in everything from rent to airfare to concert tickets, would create changes in three specific areas to lower fees for Americans preparing for retirement. These are related to closing loopholes in the purchase of any investment product, advice given about IRA rollovers and recommendations for 401(k)s and other company-sponsored plans.\n\nClosing Loopholes in the Purchase of Any Investment Product\n\nCurrently, recommendations for buying securities such as mutual funds must be in the best interest of retail investors, per the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the SEC’s guidelines don’t usually cover commodities or insurance products. States oversee the advice for purchasing insurance products.\n\nThe new rule would change this and require retirement advisers to provide advice in the best interest of the consumer for the purchase of commodities and insurance products.\n\nIRA Rollover Advice\n\nIn 2022, Americans rolled over about $779 billion from retirement plans such as 401(k)s into IRAs, according to research and consulting firm Cerulli Associates. Under current regulations, advice that is given on a one-time basis is usually not required to be in the best interest of the consumer. The proposed rule would change this and make it necessary to give one-time advice in a saver's best interest, including suggestions for IRA rollovers.\n\nRecommendations for 401(k)s and Other Company-Sponsored Plans\n\nAdvisors share suggestions with plan sponsors about which types of investments to include in retirement accounts like 401(k)s. Currently, these recommendations are not subject to the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest. The new rule would change this and make it necessary to give consumers access to investments that are in their best interest.\n\nREAD:\n\nWays to Avoid 401(k) Fees and Penalties\n\nHow the Rule Would Impact the Financial Industry\n\nFinancial advisors who act in the best interest of clients are known as fiduciaries. They are ethically and legally bound to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own.\n\n“Perhaps the easiest way to understand the intended effect of the proposed rule is to envision a fiduciary umbrella,” said Matthew Eickman, national retirement practice leader for Qualified Plan Advisors in Overland Park, Kansas, in an email. “The current fiduciary umbrella provides the opportunity for strong coverage of assets while they’re in the retirement plan but most often doesn’t extend to recommendations to move assets out of a plan or what to do once the assets leave the plan.”\n\nThe proposed rule would expand that umbrella to provide greater transparency in those situations. This could provide “more investor-specific protections relating to an individual’s particular retirement savings account,” Eickman said.\n\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid Junk Fees\n\nOne way to keep a careful eye on the costs associated with your investments is to read the fine print and ask questions about the fees. If your 401(k) is professionally managed, you may be charged a management fee or assets under management fee.\n\n“Typical 401(k) investment fees run anywhere from 0.25% to 2% a year,” said Pam Krueger, founder of advisor matching platform Wealthramp in Belvedere Tiburon, California, in an email.\n\n“You are charged a fee for the funds you hold within your retirement accounts as well,” said Kendall Meade, certified financial planner at SoFi in Charleston, South Carolina, in an email.\n\nYou can look for a fee attached to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that is often called the expense ratio. “Keep this cost in mind as you are choosing investments,” Meade said. “Actively managed funds typically have a higher expense ratio than passively managed funds.”\n\nCheck for additional charges such as administrative fees and record-keeping expenses. Sometimes the employer may cover part of the cost, and other times you could be charged.\n\nREAD\n\nWhat to Know About Financial Advisor Fees & Costs\n\nBest Practices for Working With a Financial Advisor\n\nAs you look for a professional to help you manage your long-term plan, consider their credentials and experience and understand how they are paid. “Don’t choose a nonfiduciary advisor who is not legally on the hook to have your best interests and who doesn’t have a game plan to keep fees down as part of your strategy to maximize returns and reduce risk,” Krueger said. “You need somebody on your side.”""}}",,1

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Jackson, a regional director, had witnessed problems at three trial sites she was overseeing and complained to an FDA inspector about a range of problems including falsified data, unblinded patients, and inadequately trained vaccinators who were slow to follow up on adverse events. “I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and take care of everything. What I was reporting was so important,” Jackson told The BMJ. The FDA did not, however, inspect the trial sites in question.\n\nThis lack of oversight was not an isolated case, The BMJ has learnt. Regulatory documents show that only nine out of 153 Pfizer trial sites1 were subject to FDA inspection before licensing the mRNA vaccine. Similarly, only 10 out of 99 Moderna trial sites2 and five of 73 remdesivir trial sites3 were inspected.\n\nNow, facing a backlog of site inspections, experts have criticised the FDA’s oversight of clinical trials, describing it as “grossly inadequate.” They say the problem, which predated covid-19, is not limited to a lack of inspections but also includes failing to notify the public or scientific journals when violations are identified—effectively keeping scientific misconduct from the medical establishment.\n\nThe FDA is “endangering public health” by not being candid about violations that are uncovered during clinical trial site inspections, says David Gortler, a pharmacist and pharmacologist who worked as an FDA medical reviewer between 2007 and 2011 and was then appointed as a senior adviser to the FDA commissioner in 2019-21.\n\n“The lack of full transparency and data sharing does not allow physicians and other medical scientists to confirm the data independently and make comprehensive risk-benefit assessments,” continues Gortler, who is now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington DC.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/12/texas-sues-pfizer-with-covid-anti-vax-argument-that-is-pure-stupid/', 'Headline': 'Texas sues Pfizer with COVID anti-vax argument that is pure stupid', 'Snippet': 'If Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pfizer last week, claiming the pharmaceutical giant ""deceived the public"" by ""unlawfully misrepresenting"" the effectiveness of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and sought to silence critics.\n\nThe lawsuit also blames Pfizer for not ending the pandemic after the vaccine\'s release in December 2020. ""Contrary to Pfizer’s public statements, however, the pandemic did not end; it got worse"" in 2021, the complaint reads.\n\n""We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,"" Paxton said in a press release. ""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/pfizer-is-sued-by-texas-over-covid-19-vaccine-claims-2023-11-30/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer is sued by Texas over COVID vaccine claims | Reuters', 'Snippet': 'The lawsuit seeks to stop New York-based Pfizer from making alleged false claims and silencing ""truthful speech"" about its vaccine, and more than $10 million in fines for violating a Texas law ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/05/30/fact-check-claim-misinterprets-data-2021-pfizer-report/9898129002/', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Claim misinterprets data from a 2021 Pfizer report - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities As health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million ...', 'Full_text': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities\n\nAs health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million deaths in the U.S., some online posts falsely claim the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine makes people sick and kills them.\n\n""So the leak distracted from the Pfizer dump. 46,000 people took the vaccine in a trial period...42,000 had adverse affects (sic) and 1200 died,"" reads an Instagram post shared May 5.

The vaccine had prevented a lot of contamination compared to the placebo, so we would have had very few people infected despite the vaccination.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00059-023-05183-5', 'Headline': 'The COVID-19 pandemic in China: from dynamic zero-COVID to current ...', 'Snippet': 'On 8 January 2023, after 3 years of pandemic control, China changed its management of COVID-19, applying measures against class B infectious diseases instead of Class A infectious diseases.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID U-Turn Reveals Xi Jinping’s Deep Paranoia - TIME', 'Snippet': 'It’s a quite staggering reversal.

On Tuesday, officials announced five deaths from COVID-19—up from two the previous day, which were the first recorded in the country since Dec. 3. On Wednesday, there were officially none. But a glance online tells a different story. Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45934-2', 'Headline': 'The unseen toll: excess mortality during covid-19 lockdowns - Nature', 'Snippet': 'We find that the average effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden in our period of analysis, is 33.2 deaths/100,000 inhabitants. This translates to approximately 3420 deaths in ...', 'Full_text': 'We use the Human Mortality Databases’ Short Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF)15 data (See “Placebo tests” for details) and synthetic control methods with Sweden as the treated unit to estimate the causal effect of not implementing a lockdown on excess deaths. We examine two outcomes to measure excess deaths. We use (accumulated) weekly excess mortality which are based on the 5 year average death count model, i.e., starting from the first week of November 2019 we compute the difference between weekly deaths and the average number deaths in the previous 5 years in the same week, accumulated at each subsequent week.\n\nRecent work on the viability of different model specifications for estimating excess deaths14 finds that, out of 9 different estimation methods considered, a 5 year average death count model has the strongest upward bias of excess, while a 5 year average death rate model has the strongest downward bias of excess. Accordingly, it is suggested that studies using excess death as an outcome ought to test for effects using estimates of excess deaths from both these models. If effects exist using the outcomes derived by both models, they are likely to be robust against bias introduced due to the excess death estimation approach chosen. While the death rate model adjusts for increasing deaths due to population aging, both models do not adjust for decreasing deaths due to mortality improvements14. Previous work has shown that when accounting for improved life expectancy, post-pandemic excess mortality in Sweden is higher16, thus our findings are likely to be a conservative estimate of the effect of not locking down.\n\nThe idea behind SCM is to construct a counterfactual version of Sweden (synthetic Sweden) as a weighted average of the outcome of the control units (in our case all the other countries in the STMF data for which we observe deaths and death rates from November 2014 to the end of 2020). The weights are chosen such that the distance between the observed characteristic of the treated unit and the control unit is minimized in the pre-treatment period. If the chosen weights make the pre-treatment trends of the outcome of the treated and the synthetic control overlap, under the assumption that this overlap would have continued in the treatment period in the absence of the treatment, we can use the synthetic control to estimate what would have happened to the treated unit had not it received the treatment. By using SCM, we ensure that our synthetic control unit (Synthetic Sweden) evolved in a comparable way to our treatment unit (Sweden) before the implementation of mandatory lockdown measures and therefore we can control for all confounders (including time varying confounders) which depend on pre-treatment differences. As a robustness check, we also estimate the effect of not implementing a strict lockdown in Sweden by the augmented synthetic control method12, which allows for negative weights and better pre-treament fit, and by the synthetic difference-in-differences (Synth-DiD)13, which construct weights for pre-intervention periods as well as for each unit in the donor pool. The advantage of Synth-DiD is that it allows to account not only time varying pre-treatment confounders as SCM but also for unit specific time invariant confounders as the standard DiD, combining the strengths of the two methods. For each outcome considered, we optimise the weights separately.\n\nIn Sweden, the number of infections surpassed a threshold of one infection per one million inhabitants on the 29th of February, 2020. The timing at which countries implemented a mandatory lockdown varies between 13 to 24 days from this threshold. As the treatment is not implementing a mandatory lockdown, a hypothetical treatment start date has to be chosen. For our main specification, we provide a conservative estimate choosing a slow response (4 weeks), and provide an alternative scenario for a rapid response (2 weeks) as a robustness check.\n\nSynthetic Sweden is constructed based using the weeks leading up to the start date which is Week 1 (1st week of November, 2019) to Week 22 (4th week of March, 2020) for our main specification. Our donor pool consist of 29 countries: Austria; Belgium; Bulgaria; Canada; Switzerland; Czechia; Denmark; Germany; Spain; Estonia; Finland; France; Croatia; Hungary; Iceland; Israel; South Korea; Italy; Luxembourg; Lithuania; Latvia; Netherlands; Norway; New Zealand; Poland; Portugal; Russia; Slovenia; and Slovakia.\n\nFor our main outcome of weekly excess deaths/100,000, the weights received by each country which contribute (at least 1%) to construct synthetic Sweden are: 12.3% Belgium; 19.6% Denmark; 3.8% Finland; 17.5% Lithuania; 29.6% Norway; and 17% New Zealand (the remaining 0.2% weights are assigned to the other countries in the donor pool). For our secondary outcome of weekly excess rate, the weights received by each country which contribute (at least 1%) to construct synthetic Sweden are: 52.4% Norway; 36.5% Lithuania; 4.8% Latvia; and 6.1% New Zealand (the remaining 0.2% weights are assigned to the other countries in the donor pool). Synthetic Sweden is assumed to have a lockdown lasting approximately 10 weeks, which is the average period for which the 6 donor countries imposed the mandatory lockdown. Section “Leave-one-out results” shows that the results are robust to alternative donor compositions.\n\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics and weight of the predictors used to construct synthetic Sweden. Pre-treatment values of the outcomes contribute the most when constructing the weights, while other control variables contribute less to the construction of synthetic Sweden. Deaths due to cardiovascular disease and population density are lower in Sweden as compared to synthetic Sweden. However these variables also receive low weights and at worst would likely bias our results towards zero. Due to the difficulty to construct credible measures of climate that capture variation at the country level, especially for countries with vast territories such as Sweden, we are not able to credibly control for climate. Using the World Bank data catalog that measure average monthly temperature in each country in the period 1961-1999, we find that on average Sweden is colder than Synthetic Sweden. This indicates that controlling for climate would make our estimates even larger.\n\nPanels a and b in Fig. 1 show the results of our preferred conservative estimate of a slow response (4 weeks). We find that the average effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden in our period of analysis, is 33.2 deaths/100,000 inhabitants. This translates to approximately 3420 deaths in Sweden that may have been avoided, had Sweden imposed a mandatory lockdown by Week 22, ie. towards the end of March, 2020. While Sweden and synthetic Sweden start to diverge immediately, we find that the divergence peaks towards the end of June (Week 35) with a size of 42.82 deaths/100,000 inhabitants which translates to approximately 4411 deaths. Further, we compute the SCM estimates separately by sex and find peak effect sizes of 16.68 deaths/100,000 inhabitants for females and 22.49 deaths/100,000 inhabitants for males which is consistent with the documented sex-differences in Covid-19 deaths.\n\nIt is well documented that Covid-19 disproportionately affected the elderly, particularly in the case of Sweden where Covid-19 mortality in long-term care facilities were reportedly much higher than its neighbours, 5 fold higher than in Denmark and 11 fold higher than in Norway and Finland17. We explore if our results corroborate this by examining cumulative excess deaths by heterogeneous age groups of inhabitants who are 65+ years of age and inhabitants who are below 65 years of age in panels c and d in Fig. 1. The results suggest that our main results are almost fully driven by excess deaths in the 65+ age group, in support of the evidence that ’dry-tinder’(Referring to a hypothetical stock of individuals who are at risk of dying soon18) does not account for the level of excess recorded in Sweden18.\n\nRapid response\n\nPanels e and f in Fig. 1 consider a rapid response (2 weeks), such that the hypothetical treatment starts in Week 20, for cumulative death counts and cumulative death rates respectively. Our results are not sensitive to the response time chosen.\n\nPre-treatment fit\n\nThe synthetic counterfactual for Sweden closely follows the trend of cumulative excess mortality in Sweden in the weeks leading up to the pandemic as shown in all panels in Figs. 1 and 2. The drop in excess deaths between week 10 and 20 is explained by lower mortality, especially compared to February 2018 which saw significant influenza related excess deaths in Sweden19. Extending the pre-treatment period even further by including data from previous years is not possible, as this would have severely limited our donor pool as some countries do not report weekly mortality data in the STMF-dataset for previous years. A further restriction in this regards is that excess mortality is constructed using a 5 year average approach, therefore requiring data not only for the pre-treatment period, but also 5 years prior (2014–2020). Reassuringly, our results are similar when using the augmented SCM, in Sect. “Augmented synthetic control method”, which indicates that the pre-treatment fit in our main specification is good.\n\nPlacebo tests\n\nPanels a and b in Fig. 2 present the results of placebo test in space for the outcomes of excess death counts and excess death rate respectively. The placebo tests are obtained by iteratively applying the SCM to each unit in the donor pool to obtain a distribution of placebo effects. This allows us to infer whether the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden is extreme when compared to the donor pool’s placebo effects. The figures clearly show that if any of the countries in the donor pool had not implemented a mandatory lockdown, we would seldom find an effect as extreme as that found in Sweden. This shows that our estimated impact of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden is not likely to be observed by chance, and is clearly driven by the treatment in question.\n\nLeave-one-out results\n\nPanels c and d in Fig. 2 graphs the two models for the cumulative excess deaths and excess death rate respectively, where step-wise one of the 6 donors is left out. The leave-one-out analysis reveals that the overall findings are independent of individual donor countries with the overall development of cumulative excess deaths in all leave-one-out counterfactual models behaving with rather similar trends. However, they also reveal that for the later part of 2020 (around week 35), marking the onset of what most countries referred to as “the second wave”, the findings do not appear to be clearly independent of individual donors any longer, in particular when examining the excess death rate.\n\nAugmented synthetic control method\n\nA prerequisite for SCM to be valid is that the pre-treatment outcomes for Sweden closely match the pre-treatment outcomes of synthetic Sweden. As an additional check, we use augmented SCM12, which includes a ridge regression predicting post-treatment outcomes among control units, with pre-treatment outcomes and covariates as predictors. Panels a and b in Fig. 3 present the results of augmented SCM on weekly excess deaths and weekly excess death rates respectively. The graphs plot the week-by-week point estimates along with 95% confidence intervals, calculated using the novel jackknife+ method20. The confidence intervals are quite small and show a significant positive effect in the entire post-treatment period for both outcomes (see Panels a and b in Fig. 3). The average effect size, for the weeks we examine, is 30.04 deaths/100,000 inhabitants. This is similar to our estimate using the SCM, which indicates that the estimated bias is small and that the pre-treatment fit in our main specification is adequate.\n\nSynthetic difference-in-difference\n\nWe ensure our results are robust to using the very recent advances in the SCM literature, the synthetic difference-in-difference (Synth-DiD) method21 which combines the strengths of SCM and difference-in-difference. Synth-DiD introduces weighting for both, cross-sectional units and pre-treatment time periods in the construction of synthetic Sweden, thereby improving on the precision and reliability of the estimator. Similar to SCM, it ensures that pre-treatment trends are matched somehow weakening parallel trend type assumptions typically imposed by DiD methods. Moreover, Synth-DiD, as DiD, allows for the presence of time invariant confounders. Panels c and d in Fig. 3 graph the results of this estimation for the accumulated weekly excess deaths and excess death rates respectively. The shadowed red areas under each pre-treament period represenent the weights that synth-DiD give to each period. For both outcomes the last pre-treatment week receive most of the weight. This is not surprising given that the SCM already achieved a good pre-intervention fit. The difference between the solid red line and the solid green line is the estimated average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) which is 30.06 deaths/100,000 inhabitants with a 95% CI [4.89, 55.24], this confidence interval is obtained using the method described in21. The effect is graphically illustrated by the black arrow. The dotted black line represent what would have happened had Sweden imposed a mandatory lockdown under the standard parallel trend assumption adjusting for pre-treatment trends by the synthetic control weighting. The Synth-DiD estimator approximates that 3096 excess deaths could have been avoided, had Sweden implemented a mandatory lockdown. Figure 3 also includes a placebo test which estimate the of a fake intervention that would have occurred at week 10, placebo synth-DiD Sweden is represented by the blue line. The treatment effect of the placebo intervention is very close to zero for both outcomes as shown in both panel c and d.\n\nWhat is the magnitude of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown?\n\nWith regards to the magnitude of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown, previous studies have found that implementing a lockdown in Sweden could have resulted in a 34% (by May 17th9) to upto 47% (by June 30th11) reduction in Covid-19 specific deaths. Our estimates are not directly comparable to these as we use measures of excess deaths as outcomes, as opposed to Covid-19 specific deaths. We find a conservative effect size of approximately 30 deaths/100,000 inhabitants in Sweden as compared to synthetic Sweden. This result is slightly higher than10, who finds that upto 25% of excess deaths could have been avoided by the week ending June 13th. Our findings also corroborate that of10 in that the divergence peaks towards the end of June. The magnitude of this effect remains fairly robust irrespective of the estimation method used.\n\nIs there a delay in the effect of the lockdown?\n\nWe find that Sweden and synthetic Sweden begin to diverge from end of March (Week 22) onward. This is in contrast to early studies9,10 that find a 3–5 week delay in the effect of the lockdown on Covid-19 infections which could be an artifact of idiosyncratic testing rates, specifically the extremely slow testing rate in Sweden during the initial phase of the pandemic. Our results are comparable to more recent studies using Covid-19 deaths as outcomes11, where effects are seen within a week after the introduction of lockdown in synthetic Sweden.\n\nDid Swedes reduce their mobility despite the lack of a mandatory lockdown?\n\nWe use Google mobility data to compare actual behavioural adjustments between Sweden and synthetic Sweden. Figure 3 presents the Google mobility trends for both, places of work (e) and residential areas (f) for Sweden (solid line) and for our previously constructed counterfactual synthetic Sweden (dotted line). Previous studies suggest a correlation between Covid-19 restrictions and mobility22. In comparison to the baseline (first 5 weeks of 2020), it becomes clear that during the first wave of the pandemic (March–June) Swedes spent substantially less time at their workplace (e) and instead spent more time in their residences (f). However, during this first period these changes are substantially smaller than what is observed for the earlier constructed synthetic Sweden. These results are consistent with previous work that show that Sweden only reduced its mobility by approximately half of that of its Nordic neighbours23, indicating a more limited behavioural adjustment due to the lack of regulations being enforced as mandatory. During the later half of 2020 reduced adherence and eased restrictions lead to a normalisation of mobility patterns in many countries24 with Sweden being an apparent exception, first drastically reducing workplace mobility around week 36. While mobility data is a direct measure of a certain type of individual behavioural adjustments, it is not the only one that might be relevant. Other studies25 have highlighted the potential effect of related behaviour adjustments, such as physical separation at the workplace—however, these more detailed individual behavioural adjustments and their potential impact on infection dynamics are outside the scope of this study.\n\nCan differences in healthcare capacities explain observed excess mortality?\n\nIn a 2018 study measuring healthcare access and quality performance, Sweden, unsurprisingly, scored among the leading countries in the World26 with very few cases of amenable mortality–deaths from causes that should be avoidable. A later comparison of healthcare capacity27 during the early COVID-19 pandemic found that, among the countries studied, Sweden had the lowest capacity of ICU and acute care beds going into the pandemic. The study also finds that Sweden had been able to more than double its capacity during the pandemic. To ensure our results are not driven by differences in healthcare capacity, we included two indicators of healthcare capacity (physicians and hospital beds) as controls in our analysis. Our results remain robust to this inclusion such that these controls receive almost no weight in the construction of synthetic Sweden, suggesting that Sweden’s ability to drastically increase healthcare capacity during the pandemic acts as a moderating factor. The overall composition of synthetic Sweden as countries with similarly excellent healthcare systems and thereby also similar pre-pandemic mortality patterns points towards the fact that such pre-existing trends are successfully controlled for and therefor does not explain the observed excess mortality for Sweden.\n\nExcess mortality is defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods. For excess mortality, we use the Human Mortality Databases’ STMF data series. These provide data on all-cause mortality fluctuations by week, sex and aggregated age group within each calendar year. There are several advantages of using excess deaths over data on infections or covid specific deaths to evaluate the overall impact of covid and the effectiveness of associated lockdown measures. First, data on infections are likely to suffer from measurement error due to missing data on number of tests, imperfection of accuracy of tests and sample selection in that not all covid positive individuals will get tested. Second, data on deaths due to covid is likely to be an underestimate as covid may not always be diagnosed, especially in the earlier months of the pandemic and because of heterogeneous testing policies across countries. Data on excess deaths do not suffer from measurement error arising from these dimensions. Therefore to the extent that the excess mortality has been accurately predicted, these are likely to provide a more accurate picture of the effect of Covid-19 and associated lockdown measures. Our outcomes are 5 year average death counts, and death rates calculated using the Lee-Carter model28. Data on control variables were retrieved from the Worldbank (GDP per capita 2020 & Life expectancy 2019) or Our World in Data (Age-standardized death rate cardiovascular 2019, Urbanization 2020 & Population density 2020). To control for life expectancy and age-standardized death rate by cardiovascular disease we utilized 2019 instead of 2020 data as these could be strongly affected by the pandemic itself.\n\nWe restrict our analysis to the end of September for four reasons. First, the end of September marked a return of Swedes to workplaces, as compared to synthetic Sweden shown by our analysis of Google mobility reports in Fig. 3. Second, there were significant and considerable policy changes in Sweden by October, 2020, with regards to restrictions. On the 20th of October, Uppsala became the first region to introduce local restrictions and stricter recommendations for workplaces (everyone who can work from home should do so), shops and sports facilities. People were urged to avoid public transport and contact with others who are not members of the same household. While no legal sanctions introduced, these were no longer optional restrictions. Several other regions followed suit, such that within one month, by the 19th of November, 20 out of the 21 regions of Sweden had such local restrictions and recommendations in place. Third, by the 6th of November, the difference between Sweden and Norway, the largest contributor to synthetic Sweden, with regards to their Health and Containment Index (Calculated on the basis of the following thirteen metrics: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; international travel controls; testing policy; extent of contact tracing; face coverings; and vaccine policy.) was less pronounced29. Thus, by November, synthetic Sweden is no longer an appropriate counterfactual for Sweden due to policy changes in the donor countries. We do not attempt a region based SCM analysis as done in other contexts30,31 due to low numbers in excess mortality when disaggregated into regions. Finally, yet importantly, it has been shown that estimates for excess mortality, irrespective of the specific method of estimation, struggle to accurately predict mortality patterns especially during influenza season (usually Fall / Winter)14, providing yet another reason why we decided to restrict our analysis to the end of September.\n\nSignificance statement\n\nThis paper estimates the causal effect of not implementing a lockdown in Sweden on excess deaths. We find that by the end of September, 2020, approximately 10% of all deaths in Sweden could have been avoided, had Sweden implemented a mandatory lockdown. We also find that the effect of not implementing a lockdown on excess mortality was seen in the weeks immediately following, which is in contrast to the existing evidence that examines Covid-19 infections as outcomes. By examining excess deaths attributed to all causes, we provide a comprehensive estimate of the effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown, by accounting for all deaths caused and prevented by disruptions due to the pandemic.(Supplementary information 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/world/asia/china-zero-covid-explainer.html', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-Covid Approach Explained - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'China’s “dynamic zero-Covid” policy was born out of the effort to control the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan.

But China, where it first appeared in late 2019, remains intent on eradicating the virus, carrying out extensive lockdowns and testing wherever new cases arise.\n\nThe country’s “zero-Covid” policy has been a drag on China’s economy, travel and everyday life. In some cases, lockdowns have led to widespread shortages of food and other daily necessities, such as in the northwestern city of Yining, also known as Ghulja. There, residents under lockdown for more than a month have complained about being forced to go hungry or endure woeful conditions in quarantine camps.\n\nSuch disruptions have spurred debate on whether “zero Covid” remains the best course for managing the risks posed by the pandemic. But Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has staked much of his political reputation on the policy and appears intent on sticking with it.\n\nHere’s a look at how China handles the coronavirus, the reasons behind its methods and the future of the policy.\n\nWhat is ‘zero Covid’?\n\nChina’s “dynamic zero-Covid” policy was born out of the effort to control the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan. People who have the virus are isolated or sent to hospitals, depending on the severity of their cases. Anyone deemed a close contact, which can be very broadly defined, is also isolated.\n\nWhen outbreaks are deemed severe enough, entire cities can be shut down, as Shanghai was for almost two months this spring. The southwestern city of Chengdu, with 21 million people, is now under lockdown, and many more people around the country are under some form of restriction.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

At that time, the omicron ...', 'Full_text': 'For the first time in three years, millions traveled within China earlier this month to reunite with loved ones for the country’s most important holiday, the Lunar New Year. Unfortunately, these celebrations coincided with — and are sure to exacerbate — a Covid-19 outbreak currently spreading throughout the country.\n\nThis spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.\n\nThese initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.\n\nBeijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.\n\nAlthough a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in.\n\nLockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.\n\n“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”\n\nLockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\n\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.\n\nMany countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.\n\nChina had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.”\n\nIn the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.\n\nMeanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.\n\nInstead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nIn mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.\n\nWhy China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\n\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.\n\nHowever, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.\n\nUnlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.\n\nRather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.\n\nFor example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.\n\nOther countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.\n\nAs part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.\n\nYet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”\n\nThat said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”\n\nLack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.\n\n“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”\n\nWhat this teaches us for the next pandemic\n\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases. And lockdowns, when used appropriately and swiftly, remain a useful tool in our arsenal for early pandemic days.\n\nCovid-19 was actually the “ideal candidate” for lockdowns, said Miller. This is because of the virus’s highly transmissible, airborne, and often asymptomatic nature. “Candidates for lockdown include pathogens that are novel to human populations, and therefore there is no innate immunity to them,” Miller said. “Highly infectious pathogens for which there are (currently) no vaccines or treatments are also candidates for lockdown.” In theory, the only type of diseases that lockdowns cannot mitigate are those that are not transmitted via human-to-human contact, such as water or foodborne illnesses, said Bouey.\n\nLockdowns give leaders time to develop vaccination distribution campaigns, set up contact tracing programs, and learn more about the pandemic-causing disease, Miller added.\n\nThis is why it’s important to distinguish between “short-term lockdowns with underlying goals” and “long-term lockdowns that hope to beat the odds and keep Covid out indefinitely,” said Miller. Brief lockdowns that helped “flatten the curve” were effective and helped keep hospitalizations and deaths down. But extended lockdowns, like the ones seen in China, failed to contain the virus and damaged the country’s economy and well-being.\n\n“As we have seen, these lockdowns are very disruptive, in terms of economic livelihood, as well as social life and even mental health,” said Bouey. “There is profound damage to the society and to the economy.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00191-7', 'Headline': 'China’s zero-COVID strategy: what happens next? - Nature', 'Snippet': 'China’s stringent zero-COVID strategy is likely to face its toughest test yet in the next few weeks, as millions of people travel around the country for Chinese New Year, and the Winter Olympics ...', 'Full_text': 'With Omicron or Delta outbreaks already in multiple provinces, scientists say next week’s Winter Olympics will present a major test of China’s zero-tolerance approach.'}}",97.91666666666667,1

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows.

However, if you have a side business or are self-employed, your unemployment benefits might not be as high as those who aren’t working at all.\n\nHow do unemployment benefits work?\n\nUnemployment benefits are a form of unemployment insurance meant to provide temporary financial assistance when you lose your job. This safety net is a joint program operated by states and the federal government and is designed to provide out-of-work Americans with cash.\n\n“Unemployment insurance is just that—insurance to protect you when you’ve lost your employment income through no fault of your own,” says George Warner, program director and staff attorney for the non-profit legal services provider Legal Aid at Work, which focuses on workers rights.\n\nEach state establishes its own specific criteria for benefits eligibility but generally, these criteria include:\n\nHaving become unemployed through no fault of your own.\n\nMeeting work history and wage requirements, which generally involve state criteria pertaining to the amount of time you worked prior to losing employment and the wages earned during that time.\n\nYour state may also have different requirements. You can research local requirements using the Careeronestop website, which is sponsored by the Department of Labor.\n\nCan you collect unemployment if you have a side business?\n\nUnder traditional unemployment insurance programs, the answer to whether you are able to collect unemployment benefits while operating a side business varies case by case.\n\n“It depends on a person’s specific circumstances,” says Warner. “You may be able to collect unemployment insurance even if you have a side business or part-time job. The maximum amount you can earn each week from a side business and still be eligible for benefits depends on your prior earnings and state law.”\n\nSome states, for instance, reduce the amount of unemployment benefits you are eligible to collect, says Warner. Exactly how much depends on the exact laws where you live but could be as much as a dollar-for-dollar reduction based on your side hustle income. There are states, however, that allow you to earn up to a certain percentage of your total weekly unemployment benefits from a side business or part-time job without it impacting or reducing the benefits you are paid.\n\nHowever, if you earn too much from a side business, it could make you ineligible for unemployment benefits altogether.\n\nYou’ll also want to be sure to fully report your side hustle income, as failure to do so can be considered unemployment insurance fraud, the penalties for which range from having to pay benefits back with interest to criminal charges.\n\nTo find out more about local regulations visit your state’s unemployment insurance website.\n\nHow do you apply for unemployment benefits?\n\nAnyone seeking unemployment benefits, including those with a side business, can generally do so in person, over the phone or online through the unemployment office in the state where you worked.\n\nAlthough the application process varies by state, some basic steps to take include:\n\nLocate your state’s unemployment office. The U.S. Department of Labor provides a helpful unemployment benefits locator map.\n\nPrepare your personal information. You’ll need to have details like your address, phone number and Social Security number, as well as bank information if you’d like to receive your benefits through direct deposit.\n\nGather your income information, including recent pay stubs. You might be asked for financial information, like your total income for the year. If your unemployment office requests additional documentation, you should have 1099s, your annual tax return or other proof of income on hand.\n\nWhat should you do if you’re not eligible for unemployment benefits?\n\nIf you applied for unemployment benefits as a side business owner but your application was denied, you might still have options to help you stay afloat.\n\nConsider appealing the decision\n\nYou have the right to file an appeal if you were denied unemployment benefits. Contact your state’s unemployment benefits website to formally submit an appeal. The exact requirements for the appeal might vary between states.\n\nIf your appeal is still denied, you might be able to file a second-level appeal in some states. For example, California workers can file a second-level appeal within 30 days of the date when the initial appeal was denied.\n\nCommunicate with your creditors\n\nAs you navigate a potential appeal, it’s helpful to find relief for immediate bills that come due while you await the appeal’s outcome.\n\nCommunicate regularly with your creditors to explain your current financial situation. Learn about repayment options the lender or creditor offers for individuals facing temporary financial hardship. Some lenders might offer short-term deferment or forbearance, allowing you time to look for another job before your payments begin again.\n\nSimilarly, some might be willing to negotiate a more manageable payment plan. For example, this approach can be useful for hospital bills or phone bills\n\nLiving on only your side business earnings can feel like a blow to your financial stability. However, some resources and strategies might be available to help you get through financially uncertain periods.\n\nOther alternatives if you’re small business is struggling\n\nIf you’re working to ramp up a side hustle because of a layoff, or are otherwise relying on a small business income but are struggling, you aren’t entirely without options. You can work on your small business, seek out resources and aid, and potentially look for part-time or full-time work at the same time.\n\nFor instance, the federal Small Business Administration funds a variety of specific grant programs that could apply to your business. At the state and local level, the Chamber of Commerce may have benefits for you, from grant and loan opportunities to help your business weather a setback, to mentoring and discounted membership to increase your visibility to customers. You can find your local Chamber of Commerce here.\n\nMuch like you can let side business income help float you during a layoff, you can consider seeking part-time or full-time employment during a quiet period for your side business. If your side business work has dried up or has a quiet season, look at the temporary work that is available in your area to fill the gaps. Working these jobs keeps you out and about while bringing in needed income; you may learn something in the course of working a job that makes your next steps more clear for your small business.\n\nBottom line\n\nHaving a side business that provides additional income helps combat the instability that may come from losing a job or facing unemployment. However, having additional income available to you might also make it harder for you to access the unemployment benefits that would otherwise be available if your primary source of income were to disappear.\n\nLook into your state’s rules for unemployment benefits claims to find out what you can access. Prepare all of your documentation about your loss of employment as well as your side businesses and income, and be prepared to present that information and file an appeal if necessary to get any unemployment benefits that are available to you.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/data-deep-dive-how-government-benefits-programs-are-contributing-to-the-labor-shortage', 'Headline': 'Data Deep Dive: How Government Benefits Programs Are Contributing to ...', 'Snippet': 'A new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

Millions of Americans benefited from pandemic relief payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and bolstered social programs.\n\nThese support mechanisms provided necessary help to many families during difficult times, but these same programs can discourage Americans from joining or rejoining the workforce—especially when increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits.\n\nAs businesses continue to grapple with a national workforce shortage, a flawed government benefits framework is one of many factors keeping Americans on the sidelines of the labor force.\n\nThis page dives deep into the effect pandemic benefits had on Americans\' financial wellness and unintended “benefit cliffs,” the point at which benefits are cut off, which can discourage labor market participation.\n\nThe impact of enhanced unemployment benefits\n\nDuring the pandemic, more than 20 million Americans received unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. From March 2020 to September 2021, the federal government provided an additional $300 - $600 a week to any person who was earning at least $1 in UI benefits.\n\nThe enhanced UI benefits were generous compared to regular UI benefits. On average, UI typically replaces 38% of a claimant’s average weekly wage.\n\nThe enhancement meant that most individuals were earning more on unemployment than they were while working, boosting Americans’ savings accounts, and deterring many from returning to work.\n\n24%\n\nThose who say government aid packages during the pandemic incentivized them to not actively look for work\n\n21%\n\nThose who say they never expect to be back to work full time\n\nSource: U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nEnhanced unemployment insurance and pandemic relief checks helped facilitate historic savings during the pandemic—as did the limited options for spending those savings as many normal spending options were unavailable, or significantly limited. Although those savings are coming down, in total, Americans saved about $2.7 trillion during the pandemic, 10% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nHistorically, layoffs and health emergencies stress Americans’ bank accounts and unemployed workers are eager to return to a steady paycheck. But during the pandemic, savings accounts broke with tradition and rose to unprecedented levels.\n\n$2.7 trillion\n\nThe amount Americans saved during pandemic, equal to 10% of the nation’s GDP\n\nDespite savings dwindling, labor force participation has not gone up\n\nMany Americans were able to live off the money they’d put aside, postponing a return to work. Now, more than a year out from pandemic checks and enhanced benefits, Americans are seeing their saving account dwindle with prices rising and spending on necessities resuming. But despite savings levels coming down, there has not been a substantial increase in the nation’s labor force participation.\n\nThe labor force participation rate still lags around one percentage point below where it was at the start of the pandemic, meaning nearly three million workers are still missing from the workforce.\n\nAlthough there are other barriers keeping Americans out of work, like access to childcare, navigating the loss of government benefits when earnings or savings increase is a contributing factor keeping Americans out of work right now.\n\nNavigating a loss in government benefits\n\nMost states provide 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. During that time, unemployed individuals are required to look for suitable employment and are often matched with reemployment services. Not all claimants find work by the time their UI benefits end, however. In these cases, additional government programs become critical.\n\nState and federal government benefit programs are available to assuage some difficult financial situations for low-income families and individuals. Benefits are administered at the state and federal level and most often are targeted toward a certain expense—food, care, and housing.\n\nA majority (70%) of public benefits go to non-elderly people who work, and more than half of all workers in the bottom 20% of the wage distribution receive public benefits.\n\n41 million\n\nPeople receiving SNAP benefits in 2021\n\n1 million\n\nFamilies receiving TANF benefits in 2020\n\n80.5 million\n\nPeople enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2021\n\n2.2 million+\n\nFamilies receiving housing choice vouchers in 2021\n\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; County Health Executives Association of California; The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nWhile many programs operate on a sliding scale, gradually phasing out as income rises (like SNAP benefits), some programs are terminated at the onset of increased earnings or accrued savings.\n\n$10,326\n\nAnnual value of Medicaid benefits when earned income reaches $11,000\n\n$7,552\n\nValue loss of annual SNAP benefits when income reaches $35,000\n\nThe sliding scale and income thresholds lead to what is known as the “benefits cliff”—the point at which benefits are cut off. In some situations, the increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits. For this reason, some recipients are deterred from obtaining employment, working additional hours, or pursuing promotions and career development.\n\nThe two charts below from a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation describe the effect and severity of benefit cliffs.\n\nTake for example, public assistance in Durham County, North Carolina. Bundled public benefits decrease as earnings increase. However, if wages increase from $11,000 to $27,000 the family will experience a gap in health coverage between Medicaid and American Care Act subsidies because North Carolina is a non-expansion state for Medicaid.\n\n""Qualitative research reveals important insights about how employees navigate benefits cliffs,"" says Mathieu Despard, Ph.D., MSW. ""A 2016 study of benefit recipients in Cincinnati found that none of the recipients made a job or career decision based on impending benefits cliffs. Instead, these workers said they needed help in making the transition from public benefits to wage gains, such as budgeting for food amidst a loss in SNAP benefits, and that they felt worse off financially despite wage gains. Though workers preferred not to receive public benefits, they felt unprepared in losing these benefits.""\n\nA current snapshot of American’s financial wellness\n\nThe impact of benefits cliffs are especially relevant when considering the current financial wellness of Americans. With prices rising and pandemic savings dwindling, navigating benefits is more important than ever.\n\nDebt levels are beginning to rise again\n\nDebt levels declined during the pandemic, especially credit card debt. The drop in debt and rise in savings put consumers’ personal balance sheets in a strong position. However, debt levels are starting to rise as prices rise because of high inflation, the end of government pandemic benefits, and an increase in spending now that pandemic restrictions are mostly over.\n\nFurther, many did not pay their rent or mortgages during the pandemic. That moratorium is over which means they now need to make these large payments. With savings accounts no longer growing, prices rising, and spending on necessities resuming, Americans will see rising levels of debt as interest rates are climbing.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, overall debt levels have increased by 5.4%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Credit card debt, however, decreased during the same timeframe. In 2021, Americans acquired mortgages, car payments, and personal loans while paying down credit cards.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that a majority (61%) of American consumers are living paycheck to paycheck. While this standard financial lifestyle is most common among those who earn the least, living paycheck to paycheck exists across all income levels. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are precariously close to financial distress should an emergency occur.\n\n61%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\n\n79.9%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn less than $50k\n\n63.8%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn $50k-$100k\n\n42.2%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn more than $100k\n\nA proper social net should encourage and enable labor market entry, financial stability, and economic mobility. However, the steep benefit cliffs discourage labor market participation and promotion.\n\nChanging the current framework would allow employers to fill open jobs and maximize productivity while also ensuring beneficiaries can reach self-sufficiency, build assets, and increase net worth. Policy changes that help achieve this balance include raising income limits, phasing out benefits more gradually, implementing continuous enrollment and transitional benefits, and eliminating asset tests.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

You must regularly review these rules, as non-compliance could jeopardize the non-profit’s tax-exempt status.\n\nPotential Business League Violations\n\nBusiness leagues exist to promote their members’ common interests and improve business conditions of ‘one or more lines of interest.’ Typically, these groups get into trouble if they interpret terms such as ‘promote common interests’ and ‘improve business conditions’ too broadly.

Legislators gathered back in November for the first time since adjournment in April 2022 for a two-week Veto Session. The two-week term was rather quiet, with legislators opting to leave many of the “bigger” issues unresolved until the Lame Duck Session, which ran from January 4 through January 11.\n\nWith numerous proposals being considered during that time, the Chicagoland Chamber worked to ensure that the interests of the Chicago business community were well represented.\n\nChamber and Business Groups Negotiate Successful Resolution of Historic $4.5B Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Deficit\n\nDuring the 2022 fall Veto Session and January 2023 Lame Duck Session, the Chamber, working with business partner organizations, labor representatives, the Governor’s Office, and the General Assembly, agreed to a package that eliminates the $4.5 billion Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deficit that accumulated during the early days of the pandemic, saving employers nearly a billion dollars in higher unemployment insurance taxes.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Chamber and other business groups successfully negotiated the utilization of $2.7 billion of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to be applied to the $4.5 billion Title XII debt incurred during the pandemic—largely in 2020, when government-mandated closures and operating restrictions were imposed on businesses. At the time, almost every other state used ARPA funds for repaying UI trust fund debt. Per federal law, when a state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund drops to a negative balance, federal funds are automatically borrowed. If the borrowing occurs for a period of two or more years, employers lose credit against their federal unemployment insurance tax—meaning employers will pay higher taxes.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pritzker Administration swapped $450 million from the state UI Trust Fund balance to further pay down a portion of the $1.8 billion federal Title XII debt left outstanding after the $2.7 billion payment was made in mid-2022. Then in December, Governor Pritzker signed SB 1698 (P.A. 102-1105) to provide for the substantive language of the deal, which (1) authorizes the State to use surplus revenues to pay the remaining $1.36 billion Title XII debt and (2) provides for the substantive agreement reached between business and labor groups. The final deal will mitigate tax increases on employers, improve predictability for employers, and bring greater stability to the UI Trust Fund, which was an initial ask of the labor groups. The deal is fair for both employers and workers. In the January Lame Duck Session, SB 2801 passed both the Illinois House and Senate to provide for the appropriation language necessary to finalize the agreement. It is expected that the Governor will sign the bill soon.\n\nThe UI deal is significant for Illinois employers and negates roughly $913 million in additional taxes that employers would have had to pay over the next five years. Perhaps, just as importantly, the deal and bipartisan roll call that ensued preserves the Unemployment Insurance Agreed Bill process, which has been in place since the 1980s and informally requires any legislation impacting the Unemployment Insurance System from advancing without an agreement from both business and labor groups. Without the agreed bill process, we most certainly would see annual employer tax increases. You can find the Chamber and business coalitions fact sheet on the agreement here.\n\nBusiness Development Proposal Passes with Chamber’s Strong Support\n\nEvery year, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce advocates for more State funding, support, and investment by the State in business development. Although the State has many programs and services in place that are meant to help employers throughout the state, amendments are often required.\n\nThe Government Relations team successfully managed to secure transformational changes to some of these state programs, including the following:\n\nGovernor’s “Invest in Illinois” Program: Given the State received an unexpected amount of tax revenue in 2022, due in large part to the lingering positive impact of the pandemic on consumer spending and business earnings, the Governor proposed the creation of a “closing fund”, which would grant the State the ability to offer new or existing businesses that are relocating, expanding, or making substantial investments in Illinois the ability to offer one-time cash grants to incentivize the projects. Other states, such as Ohio, Texas, among others, have perennial closing funds that they use to attract projects to their states. This year, the General Assembly headed the call and created the Invest in Illinois Program. $400 million were allocated to the program this year.\n\nEDGE Tax Credit Program. The bill (1) increases EDGE credits in projects located in underserved areas equal to 50% of the tax attributed to retained employees, (2) erodes the ‘but for” clause requiring EDGE credit applicants from demonstrating other State offers and cost differentials; and (3) reduces the requirement to self-certification. The EDGE program is one of the State’s biggest economic development tools used to attract and retain jobs in Illinois through a series of income and payroll tax credits.\n\nFilm Tax Credit Program. Extends the sunset date of the program from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2033 to allow prospective film or TV productions to have reliability in the program. The Film Tax Credit Program each year helps sustain the rapid growth of the film and TV industry in Illinois by offering productions with several tax incentives to film in Illinois.\n\nExpands Enterprise Zones. Expands the allowable square mileage of a Zone. The EZ program allows for various tax benefits to be offered to businesses that are activated in a Zone.\n\nImproves High Impact Business Program. Doubles the length of an allowable designation of a HIB and removes the requirement for businesses to prove that the incentive is needed. HIB is a tool that the State offers large business expansions or investments in new projects in the State.\n\nREV Credit Program. Expands the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) in Illinois Act (currently, Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act) to allow renewable energy product manufacturers to be eligible for REV credits, in addition to changing eligibility requirements to allow small-to-mid size businesses to apply for the credit. REV was first created in 2021 to incentivize new electric vehicle manufacturers and component part manufacturers to build in Illinois.\n\nMakes changes to the MICRO Act to grant DCEO the ability to determine criteria for the renewal of incentives provided under the Act. Increases the amount of MICRO credits for projects meeting retained employee goals to match new employee incentives. Allows for MICRO credits to be renewed for a total of either 20 or 30 years.\n\nCreates a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase sales tax credit from fuel purchased in Illinois by an air carrier from June 1, 2023 to January 1, 2033 in the amount of $1.50 per gallon of sustainable fuel. Prohibits the collection of the credit on soybean oil-derived SAF until air carriers collectively purchase SAF containing 10 million gallons of soybean oil feedstock.\n\n“Paid Leave for All Workers Act” Passes, Chamber Negotiates Deal\n\nPaid Leave is an issue that has been hotly debated for over five years in the Statehouse, with advocates typically leading the way to push for convoluted, onerous, and punitive proposals on employers. An agreement was finally brokered last week—with the Chamber playing a key role in making sure the best deal for business was reached.\n\nOnce it was clear that advocacy groups, unions, and Democratic leadership were eager to pass a bill in the last week of Session before the start of a new term, the business community came to the negotiating table seeking two main provisions: (1) require that any paid leave law passed by the General Assembly would be clear, easily implemented, and require no more than five days of leave and (2) prohibit the City of Chicago or Cook County (both jurisdictions that already have paid sick leave mandates in place) from enacting their own version of paid leave. In the end, through much negotiation, the final bill that has been sent to the Governor for his signature will contain the following:\n\n5 days of paid time off a year\n\nThere is no requirement for an employee to qualify why their leave is being taken, easing the administrative burden on employers\n\nThe employer may establish a specific process by which an employee may request time off if the request is made prospectively\n\nThe time may be front loaded or rolled-over\n\nExempts collective bargaining agreements\n\nRequires employers to maintain proper records for no less than three years\n\nFor employers that already have a leave policy in place that meets the requirements of this new law, no policy change is required\n\nProhibits retaliation\n\nAllows the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) to investigate any claims alleging a violation of the Law, and allows the IDOL to impose fines ranging from $500-$1000 for violations of the act, in addition to legal awards and additional civil penalties.\n\nThe new Law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and does not apply to any employer that is currently subject to the paid sick leave ordinances that are in effect in the City of Chicago or Cook County.\n\nOther Notable Action\n\nSB 1720 (Sims/Harris) – FY23 BIMP 2.0, which has passed both Chambers and needs to be signed into law by 12 p.m. on January 16 in order for the salary increases to go into effect. Notable provisions include:\n\nProvides for increased salaries for Constitutional Officers, Agency Directors, and members of the General Assembly\n\nThe establishment of the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force\n\n$5 million to DCEO to administer a Local Chamber Recovery Grants program\n\nAllows the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board to make grants to local units of governments and schools for the purpose of hiring and retaining law enforcement officials\n\nIncreases the cap on the Budget Stabilization Fund from 5% to 7.5% of total general funds estimated for the fiscal year and transfer $850 million from GRF to the Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nProvides the authorizing language to appropriate $460 million to hospitals throughout Illinois as hospital pandemic recovery stabilization payments\n\nProvides that, if and only if House Bill 4285 of the 102nd General Assembly becomes law, then the small purchase limit in the Procurement Code is reduced from $250,000 to $100,000\n\nHB 969 (Harris/Harmon) – FY23 Supplemental Appropriations package\n\nSB 2801 (Holmes/Welch) – Finalizes the agreed-bill Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deal to (1) appropriate $1.37 billion from GRF to UI Trust Fund to pay the remaining outstanding federal UI Title VII debt and (2) appropriate $450 million to the UI Trust Fund as a loan to be repaid over a 10-year period. The bill as amended by the House Exec Committee unanimously is awaiting House Floor action before going back to the Senate for concurrence.\n\nSB 1001 (Belt/Zalewski) – Eliminates state and local fees for liquor delivery throughout Illinoi and brings parity for liquor delivery between home-rule and non-home rule municipalities to regulate liquor delivery.\n\nHB 240 (Jones/Gillespie) – Hospital and health care omnibus package\n\nHB 4412 (Willis/Cunnningham) as amended by SA #1 – Limited changes to various energy-related provisions. The most controversial changes pertain to facility siting changes opposed by some units of local government.\n\nHB 268 (Williams/Feigenholtz) as amended by SA #1 – Creates the Tourism Preservation and Sustainability District Act, otherwise known as Tourism Improvement Districts. Similar to Business Improvement Districts, the legislation allows hotel owners to opt into a districts whereby special surcharges are assessed to be used only for the development, services, and benefits of the businesses contained in the Tourism Improvement District. The Chamber continues to discuss a similar model known as Business Improvement Districts with the City of Chicago and other stakeholders.'}}",90.0,1

But the life of the 35-year-old Air Force veteran from California, Ashli Babbitt, was far more complicated. In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death.

On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli ...', 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'Police chief turned yoga instructor insists Ashli Babbitt is not dead before Jan. 6 judge locks him up for more than a decade.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ashli-babbitt-jan-6-insurrectionist-portrayed-as-martyr-by-some-had-violent-past', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt, Jan. 6 insurrectionist portrayed as martyr by some ... - PBS', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nREAD MORE: Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nNorris later got a judicial order that barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was killed by a US Capitol police officer one year ago.\n\n“My daughter was an amazing, energetic, independent, powerful woman.

These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process. Most of them veterans, who fought for their right to be in this country, to exercise their First Amendment right to protest — and they are being denied the rights they fought for,” she said.\n\nAs Congress marked the anniversary with a moment of silence and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered speeches, a few supporters of the Jan. 6 effort gathered nearby.\n\nKeith Scott, who described himself as a proud Capitol rioter, traveled to DC from Corpus Christi, Texas, to observe the anniversary.\n\n“It was the greatest day of my life,” he said as he stood near the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the base of Capitol Hill.\n\n“I felt like a patriot – like a patriot before the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and I still feel that way.”\n\nBut he said he was disappointed the anniversary didn’t draw other supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n“Loyal Trump supporters are worn out,” he said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_hearings_of_the_United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack', 'Headline': 'Public hearings of the United States House Select Committee on the ...', 'Snippet': 'Early in the investigation, the committee held a preliminary hearing in 2021.It was only carried by C-SPAN and not widely covered on broadcast television.

An Executive Summary[7] of the committee\'s findings was published on December 19, 2022; a Final Report[8] was published on December 22, 2022.[9]\n\nDuring the first hearing on June 9, 2022, committee chair Bennie Thompson and vice-chair Liz Cheney said that President Donald Trump tried to stay in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election. Thompson called it a ""coup"".[10] The committee shared footage of the attack, discussed the involvement of the Proud Boys, and included testimony from a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Capitol Police.\n\nThe second hearing on June 13, 2022, focused on evidence showing that Trump knew he lost and that most of his inner circle knew claims of fraud did not have merit. William Barr testified that Trump had ""become detached from reality"" because he continued to promote conspiracy theories and pushed the stolen election myth without ""interest in what the actual facts were.""[11][12]\n\nThe third hearing on June 16, 2022, examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to selectively discount electoral votes and overturn the election by unconstitutional means, using John Eastman\'s fringe legal theories as justification.[13]\n\nThe fourth hearing on June 21, 2022, included appearances by election officials from Arizona and Georgia who testified they were pressured to ""find votes"" for Trump and change results in their jurisdictions. The committee revealed attempts to organize fake slates of alternate electors and established that ""Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort.""[14][15]\n\nThe fifth hearing on June 23, 2022, focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign on the Justice Department to rubber stamp his narrative of a stolen election, the insistence on numerous debunked election fraud conspiracy theories, requests to seize voting machines, and Trump\'s effort to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.[16]\n\nThe exclusive witness of the sixth hearing on June 28, 2022, was Cassidy Hutchinson, top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[17] She testified that White House officials anticipated violence days in advance of January 6; that Trump knew supporters at the Ellipse rally were armed with weapons including AR-15s yet asked to relax security checks at his speech; and that Trump planned to join the crowd at the Capitol and became irate when the Secret Service refused his request. Closing the hearing, Cheney presented evidence of witness tampering.[18]\n\nThe seventh hearing on July 12, 2022, showed how Roger Stone and Michael Flynn connected Trump to domestic militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys that helped coordinate the attack.[19][20][21]\n\nThe eighth hearing on July 21, 2022, presented evidence and details of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack on the Capitol, despite hours of pleas from officials and insiders. According to the New York Times, the committee delivered two significant public messages: Rep. Liz Cheney made the case that Trump could never ""be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again"", while Rep. Bennie Thompson called for legal ""accountability"" and ""stiff consequences"" to ""overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy.""[22]\n\nThe ninth hearing on October 13, 2022,[23][24] presented video of Roger Stone and evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] The committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony,[27][28] and a subpoena was issued one week later.[29] Trump refused to comply.[30]\n\nThe tenth hearing on December 19, 2022, convened to present a final overview of their investigative work to date, and the committee recommended that former President Donald Trump, John Eastman, and others be referred for legal charges.

This messaging presented a challenge for them, in part because they did not know in advance what information the committee would reveal at the hearings.[68][69] McCarthy spoke to donors on the morning of the second hearing, advising Republicans to ignore the proceedings, refuse public comment and avoid the topic. He suggested their party should instead discuss election issues that could garner more votes, such as focusing on rising inflation or fuel prices. Insiders have said former president Trump was not necessarily pleased with this strategy and felt there was ""no one to defend"" him.[70]\n\nPreliminary hearing – July 27, 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\n(D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nOfficer Harry Dunn – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Michael Fanone – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\nSergeant Aquilino Gonell – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Daniel Hodges – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSynopsis of preliminary hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 27, 2021, the committee held a hearing titled ""The Law Enforcement Experience on January 6th [2021]"".[42][71]\n\nAccording to C-SPAN, ""January 6 Committee Meeting with Capitol and D.C. Police: Capitol and District of Columbia police testified at the first hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Witnesses described their experiences on that day and efforts to protect the Capitol and elected officials. Throughout the hearing, graphic video footage captured during the attack was shown.""[72]\n\nThe four officers—Dunn, Fanone, Gonell, and Hodges—were given a front-row seat to all of the committee\'s public hearings in 2022.[73] All four, along with others, received the Presidential Citizens Medal from Joe Biden on January 6, 2023.[74]\n\nFirst hearing – June 9, 2022 – Primetime\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nCaroline Edwards – police officer, Capitol Police\n\nNick Quested – documentary filmmaker\n\nMarcus Childress – investigative counsel for the Select Committee[75]\n\nCandyce Phoenix – senior investigative counsel for the Select Committee[75]\n\nWilliam Barr – former Attorney General of the United States[76][77][78]\n\nJason Miller – senior Trump campaign spokesman[79]\n\nAlex Cannon – Trump campaign lawyer[80]\n\nIvanka Trump[81]\n\nJared Kushner[82]\n\nRichard Donoghue – former Acting Deputy Attorney General of the United States[83]\n\nMarc Short – Chief of Staff to Vice President Pence\n\nMark Milley – General, Chairman Of The Joint Chiefs Of Staff[84][85]\n\nJeremy Bertino[75]\n\nEnrique Tarrio – former Chairman of the Proud Boys[75]\n\nStewart Rhodes – founder, Oath Keepers[75]\n\nDonald Trump\n\nMike Pence\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nJim McGovern – Representative (D-MA 2nd district)\n\nJanuary 6 arrestees[86]\n\nRobert Schornack\n\nEric Barber\n\nJohn Wright\n\nGeorge Meza – member, Proud Boys\n\nDaniel Herendeen\n\nMatthew Walter\n\nUnnamed January 6 rioters\n\nSynopsis of first hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThis was the first of the hearings for broadcast on live television and was held during prime time. The committee showed never-before-seen footage of the Capitol attack to provide an accessible and compelling narrative of events for the public.[87]\n\nOpening statements by the panel members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee panel observed that Donald Trump attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy.[88][89] According to Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, ""Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan. 6, to overthrow the government ... The violence was no accident. It represents Trump\'s last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power."" According to the committee, Trump ""lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president.""[88][89]\n\nPanel members made reference to a federal district court opinion in which the Judge David O. Carter said Trump had ""likely"" violated two federal statutes and staged a ""coup in search of a legal theory"".[90][91] Rep Liz Cheney read part of the opinion, in which the court said:\n\nIf Dr. Eastman and President Trump\'s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.[92]\n\nCheney urged all Americans to read the opinion in full. Cheney said Trump\'s efforts were part of a ""sophisticated seven-part plan"", which the committee hearings would establish.[93]\n\nThe Trump administration\'s seven-part plan to overturn the 2020 election, according to the January 6 Committee[93][94]\n\n1. Trump had knowledge that he lost the 2020 election but spread misinformation to the American public and made false statements claiming significant voter fraud led to his defeat;\n\n2. Trump planned to remove and replace the Attorney General and Justice Department officials in an effort to force the DOJ to support false allegations of election fraud;\n\n3. Trump pressured Vice President Pence to refuse certified electoral votes in the official count on January 6, in violation of the U.S. Constitution;\n\n4. Trump pressured state lawmakers and election officials to alter election results in his favor;\n\n5. Trump\'s legal team and associates directed Republicans in seven states to produce and send fake ""alternate"" electoral slates to Congress and the National Archives;\n\n6. Trump summoned and assembled a destructive mob in Washington and sent them to march on the U.S. Capitol; and\n\n7. Trump ignored multiple requests to speak out in real time against the mob violence, refused to instruct his supporters to disband, and failed to take any immediate actions to halt attacks on the Capitol.\n\nA written version of the above plan was released after the hearing.[94][95]\n\nTrump knew that he lost\n\n[edit]\n\nMany in Trump\'s inner circle informed the president he had lost and there was no evidence of widespread fraud. According to several video clips of prior testimony shown by the committee:\n\nA senior adviser to the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, testified that Trump was internally advised he had lost the election. According to Miller, the campaign\'s top data aide, Matt Oczkowski, told Trump very shortly after the election ""in pretty blunt terms, that he was going to lose"".[96]\n\nTrump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon testified he had spoken to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in November 2020 soon after the election and told Meadows there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. According to Cannon, Meadows replied: ""So there\'s no there there.""[97]\n\nAccording to his testimony, attorney general Bill Barr ""said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were \'bullshit\'"".[97]\n\nIvanka Trump said she ""accepted"" Barr\'s assessment.[97]\n\nRush to issue presidential pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nCheney observed White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of lawyers had threatened to resign in response to an increasingly hostile climate of lawless activity within the Oval Office. Another video clip was then shown in which Jared Kushner characterized Cipollone\'s concerns as ""whining."" During his testimony, Kushner claimed that his primary ""interest at that time"" was to complete as many presidential pardons as possible.[98] Cheney also said that Representative Scott Perry and other Republican members of Congress had ""sought Presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.""[44]\n\nAttack on the Capitol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee showed video, much of it never before seen by the public, of the mob charging the Capitol and battling police. The video began with scenes of roughly 200 Proud Boys leading the assault on the Capitol. As later scenes showed a violent rampage, audio was overlaid of Trump later saying, ""The love in the air. I\'ve never seen anything like it."" As the attack lasted several hours, the video contained timestamps to illustrate the timeline.[99] Documentary filmmaker Nick Quested provided testimony during the live hearing; he was embedded with the Proud Boys on January 6. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also testified live and in-person; she was seriously injured[100] on January 6 while defending the Capitol against initial attacks by Proud Boys and during the mob violence that followed.[101]\n\nQuested testified that he joined the Proud Boys at the National Mall at 10:30 a.m., saying ""I don\'t know if violence was a plan, but I do know that they weren\'t there to attend the rally because they had already left the rally by the time the president had started his speech."" According to Quested, they then walked around the Capitol while taking some pictures and observed a sole police officer at the barricades by the Peace Circle.[44] After suggesting the Proud Boys were doing reconnaissance to spot security weaknesses, Chairman Thompson observed that the Proud Boys chose that barricade and breached it at about the same time President Trump directed the rally attendees to march to that same location. He then said:\n\nNow a central question is whether the attack on the Capitol was coordinated and planned. What you witnessed is what a coordinated and planned effort would look like. It was the culmination of a months\' long effort spearheaded by President Trump.[44]\n\nOfficer Edwards, who had sustained multiple injuries during the attack, testified that the group of Proud Boys who first approached the police barricades began by shouting rhetoric to turn the police into ""villains"" and then began their assault. She described in detail her experiences and injuries as police fell back. When asked what she remembers most vividly, Edwards described moving from an area with a relatively small field of view to one where she had her first view of the events unfolding before the Western Terrace.\n\nWhen I fell behind that line and I saw, I can just remember my—my breath catching in my throat, because what I saw was just a—a war scene. It was something like I\'d seen out of the movies. I—I couldn\'t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up ... Never in my wildest dreams did I think that, as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know, I—I\'m trained to detain, you know, a couple of subjects and—and handle—you know, handle a crowd, but I—I\'m not combat trained.""[44]\n\nPence called for the National Guard\n\n[edit]\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, in videotaped testimony, said the White House encouraged him to claim that Trump had ordered the National Guard to respond on January 6, even though it was Pence who in fact gave the order.[97] Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted on January 6 that former President Trump had ""directed"" the National Guard to respond.[102] The reasons that the White House attempted to falsely credit Trump for National Guard mobilization remains unclear.[103]\n\nIt was always known that Pence gave the order. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had publicly stated so on the day of the attack. As a result, CNN later questioned whether Pence was ""acting as commander in chief.""[102] Miller gave similar testimony to Congress on May 12, 2021, before the House select committee was formed.[104]\n\nSecond hearing – June 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nKevin Marino – attorney for Bill Stepien\n\nChris Stirewalt – former Fox News Political Editor\n\nBenjamin Ginsberg – election attorney, counsel to the George W.

J. Pak testified. Pak resigned from his position days before the January 6 attack; he later told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the White House informed him Trump would fire him if he did not publicly state his office had found election fraud in Georgia.[131][132]\n\nChris Stirewalt, a former Fox News politics editor, testified. Fox News was the first network to declare Biden as having won Arizona in the 2020 election; Stirewalt testified that as the vote count wrapped up, he saw Trump\'s statistical chances of winning shrink to essentially zero. After Stirewalt defended that journalistic choice, Fox News fired him in January 2021.[133][134]\n\nAl Schmidt, the Republican former city commissioner of Philadelphia, testified. He had drawn Trump\'s ire for refusing to publicly announce the city\'s election results were rife with fraud. He resigned in 2021, saying he had received death threats.[131]\n\nBen Ginsberg, a long-term Republican election attorney involved in the controversial Bush v. Gore litigation, testified as an expert about why Trump\'s election lawsuits failed.[135]\n\nSubpoena and absence of Bill Stepien\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Stepien was subpoenaed to testify, but his wife went into labor and he canceled his appearance;[133] his attorney was then to have read a statement on his behalf, but did not.[136] Stepien is a longtime Republican operative who joined Trump\'s 2016 campaign, later becoming the White House political director, before becoming Trump\'s campaign manager two months before the 2020 election. He was involved in the Stop the Steal effort, including spreading false information about voting machines despite a staff memo finding the allegations were false. Stepien had provided the committee a deposition under subpoena in December 2021.[137][138] The Select Committee made ten video clips of Stepien\'s deposition available following the meeting.[109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116][117][118]\n\nKnowledgeable insiders dismiss voter fraud allegations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Select Committee showed several video clips of White House and Trump campaign insiders patly dismissing claims of voter fraud.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said Rudy Giuliani was ""definitely intoxicated"" on election night when he advised Trump to lie that he had won.[139]\n\nTrump campaign staffer Bill Stepien said he disagreed with Giuliani\'s advice on this matter: ""Ballots were still being counted. It was far too early to be making any proclamation like that.""[139] Stepien said that Trump\'s advisers fell into two camps on this matter, and Stepien considered himself to be on ""Team Normal"".[140]\n\nMore video of Barr\'s testimony was presented. At times he could not control his laughter at the absurdity of some fraud allegations, such as the ""Italygate"" conspiracy theory, which claims that satellites controlled from Italy had been compromised and used to attack voting machines, and that former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez had orchestrated an election fraud scheme, despite having died seven years earlier. Barr testified Trump never gave ""an indication of interest in what the actual facts were,"" adding the president had ""become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff."" Barr also laughed at the mention of Dinesh D\'Souza\'s recent film 2000 Mules, dismissing the fictional assertions of widespread election fraud.[141][142]\n\nFalse claims appeared in Trump fundraising\n\n[edit]\n\nCommittee member Zoe Lofgren and the Select Committee\'s senior investigative counsel Amanda Wick described how Trump used false claims of election fraud by a ""left-wing mob"" to solicit donations for an ""Official Election Defense Fund"" beginning days after the election. The solicitation raised some $250 million in total, nearly $100 million in the first week. Lofgren noted most election-related litigation had ended within weeks of the election, yet the requests for cash contributions continued. Reuters analysis of the legal language of the email solicitations days after they began showed that donors were asked to register for recurring donations and that donations under $8,000 would not go into a defense fund, but rather to Trump\'s Save America PAC and to the Republican National Committee, which would have broad discretion over the funds. Lofgren asserted, ""Not only was there the big lie, there was the big rip-off."" Lofgren later said on CNN that the committee had evidence that members of Trump\'s family and inner circle had personally benefited from the post-election fundraising, specifically stating that Kimberly Guilfoyle had been paid $60,000 for delivering a 21⁄2 minute introduction at the Stop the Steal rally, though that fee was paid by Turning Point Action.[143][144][145][146]\n\nThird hearing – June 16, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\nGreg Jacob – former Counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nJ.

Pence himself was not present at the hearing and did not offer video testimony.[13]\n\nExperts testimony on the Constitutional role of the Vice President in the election\n\n[edit]\n\nJ. Michael Luttig, a longtime Republican who had clerked for Antonin Scalia and Warren Burger before becoming a federal appeals court judge, testified in-person.[169] Had Pence ""obeyed the orders from his president,"" it ""would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis,"" he said.[170]\n\nBefore the hearing, Luttig wrote a statement for the record that Trump and his allies ""instigated"" a war on democracy ""so that he could cling to power."" He continued, ""It is breathtaking that these arguments even were conceived, let alone entertained by the President of the United States at that perilous moment in history"" and that January 6 ""was the final fateful day for the execution of a well-developed plan by the former president to overturn the 2020 presidential election at any cost."" On the day before the Capitol attack, Luttig had—at the request of Pence\'s aides—publicly opined that the vice president had no constitutional authority to intervene in the election certification, which Pence cited in his January 6 letter stating he would not intervene.[171][172]\n\nGreg Jacob, former counsel to Pence, testified in-person. He had advised Pence he did not have the authority to overturn the election results.[13] In his legal opinion, he said, those who wrote the Constitution wouldn\'t have ""put it in the hands of one person to determine who would be the president of the United States"".[170] He also said that John Eastman had told him privately that he didn\'t expect a single Supreme Court Justice would support the validity of the fake electors scheme.[173]\n\nA video was shown of testimony by Marc Short, former Pence chief of staff.[170] According to Short, Pence knew he had no legal authority to overturn the election and had said so ""many times"" to Trump.[174]\n\nNarrative of Vice President Pence and the events of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer White House lawyer Eric Herschmann had told the committee that Rudy Giuliani privately admitted on the morning of January 6 that Pence didn\'t have authority to overturn the election, even though Giuliani gave a speech at the Ellipse that afternoon telling the opposite to the crowd. Herschmann\'s videotaped testimony was publicly revealed for the first time.[175]\n\nAccording to a timeline presented by the committee, by 2:10 pm the Capitol had been breached and the mob began swarming in. Trump became aware of the breach and at 2:24 pm tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what was necessary."" The committee revealed that the mob, some chanting ""hang Mike Pence,"" came within 40 feet (12 m) of the vice president as he was evacuated from his office to an underground loading dock. Greg Jacob testified the Secret Service instructed Pence and his aides to get in cars, which most did; Pence declined, and the head of his security detail assured the vice president he would not be evacuated from the Capitol without his permission. Pence responded that he knew and trusted his security chief, but that he was not the one driving the car. Jacob said Pence did not want the world seeing him fleeing and giving the insurgents any satisfaction from it. Pence then spent the next five hours in a secure underground location within the Capitol Building complex. The Department of Justice spoke to a confidential witness who traveled to Washington with the Proud Boys and swore under oath that they would have killed Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi if given the chance.[176][170][177]\n\nThe committee alleged that Eastman was aware his ""coup memo"" and other legal recommendations and political activities were potentially criminal. He emailed Trump\'s former attorney Rudy Giuliani several days after the attack on the Capitol, saying, ""I\'ve decided I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works"", but he did not receive a pardon.[170] During his taped deposition, he pleaded the Fifth 100 times—reserving the right to avoid self-incrimination—and refused to answer any questions regarding his participation in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[178][179]\n\nLuttig warns about 2024\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the close of the hearing, Luttig said:\n\nDonald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy. They would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election, but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020. I don\'t speak those words lightly. I would have never spoken those words ever in my life, except that that\'s what the former president and his allies are telling us ... [that they] are executing that blueprint for 2024 in the open, in plain view of the American public.[180][181]\n\nFourth hearing – June 21, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nRusty Bowers – Speaker of the Arizona State House of Representatives\n\nBrad Raffensperger – Georgia Secretary of State\n\nGabriel Sterling – Chief Operating Officer in the Georgia Secretary of State Office\n\nWandrea ""Shaye"" Moss – employee of the Department of Registration and Elections in Fulton County, Georgia, from 2017 until 2022\n\n""Lady"" Ruby Freeman – mother of Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, present in person but heard via pre-recorded testimony\n\nJosh Roselman – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nCasey Lucier – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nWilliam Barr – former Attorney General\n\nB.

The committee presented part of a video deposition of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who testified Trump had called her about helping to further the scheme; Eastman also participated in the call.[186][187]\n\nTrump calls the Georgia Secretary of State\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, whose phone call with Trump was cited in the former president\'s second impeachment, testified that his office pursued hundreds of allegations of voter fraud but found no widespread fraud that would have changed the election result. In the end, he found only 74 votes from people who had been ineligible to vote because of felony convictions and only 4 votes in the names of deceased people. There were no votes from underage or unregistered voters.[188] (Biden had won the Georgia election by 11,779 votes.) Gabriel Sterling, Raffensperger\'s deputy, also testified.[14]\n\nDuring the Raffensperger testimony, the committee played audio excerpts of the phone call he had with Trump on January 2, 2021, and another call with Frances Watson, the chief investigative officer for Raffensperger\'s office. Trump told Watson, ""when the right answer comes out you\'ll be praised."" Trump is heard to tell Raffensperger he had won Georgia by at least 400,000 votes, though he actually lost by 11,779 votes. He told Raffensperger, ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."" Trump repeated a debunked allegation that a video showed a suitcase containing a minimum of ""18,000 ballots, all for Biden"" brought to a ballot counting facility late at night for counting. Trump pleaded with Raffensperger to find ""the real truth"" and suggested Raffensperger could be criminally liable if he did not accede to the president\'s wishes:\n\nWhy wouldn\'t you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? So look, can you get together tomorrow? And Brad, we just want the truth. It\'s simple. And—and everyone\'s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It\'s Ok. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the truth—the real truth is I won by 400,000 votes, at least. So—so what are we going to do here? Because I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break...I think you\'re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned, the ballots are—are corrupt and they\'re brand new and they don\'t have seals and there\'s a whole thing with the ballots, but the ballots are corrupt and you\'re going to find that they are—which is totally illegal. It\'s—it\'s more illegal for you than it is for them. Because you know what they did and you\'re not reporting it. That\'s a—you know, that\'s a criminal—that\'s a criminal offense. And you know, you can\'t let that happen. That\'s—that\'s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that\'s a big risk.[189]\n\nSurrogates pressured the Arizona House leadership\n\n[edit]\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified. Bowers said that Trump had personally pressured him to overturn the state\'s election results, as had Rudy Giuliani, Ginni Thomas,[190] and John Eastman. Bowers said that Eastman told him: ""Just do it and let the courts sort it out."" Bowers characterized Trump\'s scheme as ""cheating"", since there was ""no evidence being presented of any strength"" of the claims. He said that participating in Trump\'s lie would have been ""foreign to my very being."" He also testified that Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs called him on the morning of January 6, asking him to overturn the Arizona results. Shortly before the committee hearing, Trump released a statement saying that Bowers had privately agreed with him in November 2020 that the Arizona election was rigged and stolen, but Bowers specifically denied Trump\'s allegation during the hearing while under oath.[191] Bowers testified Giuliani told him, ""We\'ve got lots of theories. We just don\'t have the evidence.""[186]\n\nSean Riley ""alternate electors"" plan for Wisconsin and Michigan\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Trump fake electors plot\n\nThe committee revealed a text message sent by Senator Ron Johnson\'s chief of staff Sean Riley minutes before the vote certification began on January 6. In the message, Riley informed Pence\'s aide Chris Hodgson that the senator wanted to personally hand deliver information to the vice president about ""alternate slates of electors for MI and WI"" to which Hodgson replied, ""do not give that to him.""[192]\n\nImpact of false fraud allegations on election workers\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea\' ArShaye Moss testified about their experiences. After the election, Trump and Giuliani amplified a video that was taken out of context, and used the footage to make baseless claims that Freeman and Moss had committed election fraud. The women and their family members were subjected to anti-Black racist smears and death threats and were warned by the FBI that they would not be safe in their home. During her testimony, Freeman said ""There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you?""[193][194] Ms. Moss said that the false accusations made against her had impacted her well-being ""in a major way—in every way—all because of lies.""[195]\n\nReactions to fourth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFox News anchor Martha MacCallum acknowledged on June 21 after the fourth hearing: ""The lack of [election fraud] evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here, where these [Republican] people are saying, \'Look, I supported you, please give me something to work with,\' and it simply doesn\'t materialize.""[196] Fox News host Brian Kilmeade similarly said on June 26 that Trump\'s allies ""couldn\'t prove"" any cheating had occurred.[197]\n\nBy the fourth hearing, committee members saw an increase in threats against them and were likely to be assigned security details. Kinzinger\'s wife received a handwritten letter that threatened to execute her, her husband and their five-month-old baby.[198]\n\nA month later, on July 20, the Arizona Republican Party censured Rusty Bowers for reasons ""including co-sponsoring Democrat-led bills"" and ""refusing to work with"" Arizona Republicans. They did not directly mention his public testimony at the committee\'s fourth hearing.[199] The state party had censured other leaders the previous year for criticizing Trump.[200]\n\nFifth hearing – June 23, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nSteven Engel – former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel\n\nJeffrey A.

Miller – former Acting Secretary Of Defense\n\nSynopsis of fifth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fifth televised public hearing focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign to influence top Justice Department officials, demanding they investigate election fraud conspiracy theories and rubber stamp his narrative that the election was stolen, despite any factual evidence to support this claim. The hearing additionally detailed Trump\'s request to seize voting machines in late December 2020; plans to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general were also revealed. Witnesses included Jeffrey Rosen, former acting attorney general; Richard Donoghue, former acting deputy attorney general; and Steven Engel, former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\n""Just say it was corrupt""\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Trump\'s request, acting defense secretary Christopher Miller contacted an attaché in Rome about the debunked QAnon theory which alleged an Italian defense contractor uploaded malware to a satellite in order to hack the election results and remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. The conspiracy theory was relayed by Congressman Scott Perry to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who then asked Rosen and Donoghue to investigate on behalf of the Department of Justice.[201] They flatly rejected the request as ""patently absurd.""[202] The conspiracy theory was also pushed by former CIA employee Bradley Johnson,[201] who was among those who gave video testimony.[203]\n\nRosen and Donoghue continued to strongly resist Trump\'s efforts to have the Justice Department announce election fraud had been found, just days after outgoing attorney general Bill Barr had resigned and announced that there was no significant evidence found which could have influenced the election.[204] Donoghue testified that during a phone call with then president Trump on December 27, he was told to ""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.""[205][206]\n\nOn December 31, Trump rushed back to Washington, D.C., from his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate in order to hold an emergency meeting at the White House, in which Justice Department officials were called upon to attend. At one point, Trump told them that voting machines had been hacked and the election stolen. Trump then asked ""why don\'t you guys seize these machines?"" Richard Donoghue explained that experts at DHS had already investigated and that there was ""nothing wrong with the voting machines ... and no factual basis to seize machines.""[207] Trump then yelled: ""Get Ken Cuccinelli on the phone"" and proceeded to insist that it was his job, as the Homeland Security deputy secretary, to seize voting machines. He told Cuccinelli ""you\'re not doing your job.""[208] During the public hearing, Jeffrey Rosen testified that the Department of Justice has no legal authority to seize voting machines and that he never informed Trump that the Department of Homeland Security could seize voting machines either.[209]\n\nAborted attempt to install Jeffrey Clark as Attorney General\n\n[edit]\n\nClark was shown to have provided a ""proof of concept"" letter, that was composed by John Eastman and Justice Department lawyer Ken Klukowsi, intending that the letter be delivered to Georgia officials. The letter falsely asserted that the Justice Department found election irregularities in that state and others, in an effort to persuade the state legislature to rescind Biden\'s certified victory in Georgia. In response to this proposed letter, a ""contentious"" meeting was held between Clark, Attorney General Rosen, and Deputy Attorney General Donoghue, in which Donoghue told Clark: ""What you are doing is nothing less than the United States Justice Department meddling in the outcome of a presidential election.""[210] When Rosen refused to send the letter, Clark then sought to take over the Department of Justice so that he could send the letter himself.[211]\n\nAccording to The New York Times it was Rep. Scott Perry who had first introduced Trump and Clark, because of Clark\'s ""openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud"" and willingness to do the president\'s bidding.[212] The committee presented text messages from December 26, 2020, between Rep. Perry and Mark Meadows, that revealed the congressman\'s role in the attempted scheme that unfolded days later to oust Rosen and install Clark as the top DOJ official.[213]\n\nWhite House call logs from the afternoon of January 3 showed that officials within the Oval Office were already referring to Clark as the ""Acting Attorney General"" although not having been officially appointed to the position. Later that day, in a meeting at the White House with top Department of Justice officials, Trump openly considered a move to replace Rosen with Clark, saying ""What do I have to lose?"" to which Deputy Attorney General Donoghue replied ""Mr. President, we\'d resign immediately. I\'m not working one minute for this guy, who I just declared was completely incompetent ... I\'m telling you what\'s going to happen. You\'re gonna lose your entire department leadership. Every single one of us will walk out. Your entire department of leadership will walk out within hours.""[214]\n\nUltimately, the effort to appoint Clark, send the letter to Georgia officials, and attempt to decertify election results was averted when a majority of the DOJ Assistant Attorneys General threatened to resign en masse if the scheme went forward.[215][216] During Clark\'s video taped deposition with the committee, he refused to answer most questions, and pleaded the Fifth more than 100 times during his 100-minutes-long interview with investigators.[217]\n\nRequest for preemptive pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nExtracts of a January 11 email sent by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks were shared. The congressman, who had championed efforts in the House to overturn the election in Trump\'s favor, contacted former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with pardon requests for himself, Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert and ""every Congressman and Senator"" who recently voted to reject official electoral college submissions for Arizona and Pennsylvania.[218][215] White House aides mentioned that Andy Biggs of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania had all requested preemptive pardons.[219][213] Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Meadows, previously told the committee that Rep. Jim Jordan also talked generally about pardons for members of Congress.[220]\n\nSixth hearing – June 28, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nCassidy Hutchinson – principal aide to President Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nMax Miller – Deputy Campaign Manager for presidential operations Trump 2020\n\nNick Luna – White House special assistant to the President\n\nKayleigh McEnany – Former White House Press Secretary\n\nMichael Flynn – Former National Security Advisor\n\nMatthew Pottinger – United States Deputy National Security Advisor from September 22, 2019, until January 7, 2021\n\nSynopsis of sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sixth televised hearing was dedicated entirely to the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[221][222][223] Meadows had provided a large amount of documentation to the committee but then stopped cooperating,[224][225] sued the committee,[226] and was held in criminal contempt of Congress in December 2021.[227]\n\nDue to heightened security concerns surrounding Hutchinson\'s testimony, the committee announced this hearing only one day in advance.[228][229] Ms. Hutchinson obtained her own security prior to her public appearance,[230] and the committee enhanced its security for the sixth hearing at which she testified.[231]\n\nPrelude to January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson said that Rudy Giuliani told her on January 2 that Trump and his allies planned to go to the Capitol on January 6. When she reported this to her boss, Meadows, he ""didn\'t look up from his phone and said something to the effect of ... \'things might get real, real bad\'."" The committee also showed prior videotaped testimony in which Hutchinson said the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were mentioned in the context of planning the January 6 rally, especially in Giuliani\'s presence.[232] She said that White House counsel Pat Cipollone tried to prevent anyone from the White House from marching to the Capitol and told her personally: ""Please make sure we don\'t go up to the Capitol, Cass. ... We are going to get charged with every crime imaginable.""[233]\n\nHutchinson said she persuaded Meadows not to go to Giuliani and Eastman\'s ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel on the evening of January 5, where former National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was also present. Meadows, she said, told her he would instead phone into the meeting.[234]\n\nFlynn was subpoenaed by the committee. During his interview, Rep. Cheney asked: ""General Flynn, do you believe in the peaceful transition of power in the United States of America?"" He pled the Fifth. This video clip was shown at the hearing.[235][236]\n\nHutchinson testified that on the day before the Capitol attack, Trump directed Meadows to contact Flynn and Roger Stone, who both had extensive ties to extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, leaders of which would later be indicted for seditious conspiracy for their alleged roles in the attack.[237]\n\nHutchinson account of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nTrump had insisted on specific language for his speech at the January 6 rally. Hutchinson recalled legal advice given by Eric Herschmann, who said it would be ""foolish"" to include some of the phrases, such as ""We\'re going to March to the Capitol"" and ""Fight for Trump ... Fight for the movement."" Herschmann also warned against making negative references to Mike Pence.[238][239]\n\nSome people brought weapons, including AR-15s, to Trump\'s speech, according to police radio transmissions.[240] Trump knew the crowd was armed yet wanted security checks loosened; he specifically wanted the magnetometers removed.[241][242][243] Hutchinson, who was present at the rally, testified that she heard Trump say ""something to the effect of \'I don\'t F-ing care that they have weapons. They\'re not here to hurt me.\'"" Meadows and deputy chief of staff for operations Tony Ornato were also aware of the weapons, according to Hutchinson.[232] As the mob became more vocal, calling for Pence to be hanged, Hutchinson overheard a conversation between Cipollone and Meadows, in which Cipollone argued that they needed to act urgently to prevent violence. Meadows, however, reminded Cipollone of Trump\'s current feelings that Pence ""deserves it"" and that Trump ""doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.""[232]\n\nShe testified that Trump wanted to appear in-person at the Capitol following his speech to supporters. Secret Service agent Robert Engel said it would not be safe to go to the Capitol and insisted on taking him to the White House instead. Hutchinson was told later that day by Tony Ornato that Trump became very angry and insisted he wanted to go to the Capitol.[242] Ornato said Trump grabbed for the steering wheel of the presidential SUV[244] with one hand and lunged at Engel with his other hand, according to Hutchinson.[245][232] She testified that Engel was sitting in a chair, looking ""somewhat discombobulated and a little lost"" while Ornato related the account of these events, and that Engel never contradicted the story.[246][247]\n\nCNN reported three days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump\'s driver. Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump ""tried to lunge over the seat—for what reason, nobody had any idea,"" but no one asserted Trump assaulted Engel.[248] Politico reported the same day that Engel told the committee during an early 2022 deposition that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months.[249]\n\nWhile the committee questioned Hutchinson, they showed brief clips of the videotaped testimony of others. National Security Council records, which identified Trump by his codename ""Mogul,"" also backed Hutchinson\'s claim that security was loosened, and that orders were made to NSC and Secret Service for ""clearing a route"".[250]\n\nImmediate January 6 aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson testified that during the riot she wrote down from Meadows\' dictation a proposed statement the president might release, instructing the insurgents to leave the Capitol. She said White House attorney Eric Herschmann ""chimed in"" with his input. The note was displayed during the hearing, and Hutchinson confirming it was in her handwriting. After the hearing, Herschmann said through a spokesperson that he had written the note.[251]\n\nHutchinson testified that both Meadows and Giuliani sought presidential pardons.[252]\n\nRep. Cheney addresses possible tampering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn closing remarks, Cheney expressed concern that some witnesses may have been given messages intended to influence their testimony. She said a witness, whom she did not name, told the committee they had received multiple such messages prior to giving testimony to the committee: ""What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know that I\'m on the team, I\'m doing the right thing, I\'m protecting who I need to protect, you know, I\'ll continue to stay in good graces in Trump world.""[253] She quoted another unnamed witness being told that ""he is thinking about you"", that ""he knows you\'re loyal"" and ""will do the right thing.""[253] Two days after the hearing, Politico reported that Hutchinson was the recipient of the quoted communications, prior to her March 7 deposition, and that the ""he is thinking about you"" message came from an intermediary for Mark Meadows.[254] Cheney stated that the committee was taking allegations of witness tampering seriously and that they would consider the ""next steps"" necessary to address the issue.[255][256]\n\nOn December 20, 2022, it was reported that Trump administration ethics attorney Stefan Passantino had advised Hutchinson, who was then his client, to testify that she didn\'t remember details. Trump’s Save America PAC was paying for Passantino\'s services, which Hutchinson was not aware of. Hutchinson disagreed with Passantino\'s advice and switched lawyers before she testified.[257][258]\n\nReactions to sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson’s testimony was subject to significant national attention. According to Time, ""[it] garnered a reaction that no other had received to date. As she exited the hearing room when the committee broke for a short recess, a crowd in the back applauded her.""[259] Fox News host Bret Baier said her ""testimony was very compelling from beginning to end""; conservative commentator George Conway said ""This is the most astonishing testimony I have ever seen or heard or read. You could litigate or investigate for a thousand years and never see anything as mind-blowing as this.""[260] The Lawfare blog editorialized, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Testimony Changed Our Minds about Indicting Donald Trump"".[261] The testimony was widely characterized by legal analysts and the press as highly significant, particularly in the context of possible indictments of Trump and his associates in the Justice Department\'s criminal investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Former Trump attorney general Bill Barr remarked, ""the department is clearly looking into all this, and this hearing definitely gave investigators a lot to chew on.""[262][263]\n\nAfter Hutchinson\'s testimony, CNN reported that an unnamed ""Secret Service official familiar with the matter"" said Ornato denied telling Hutchinson about a physical altercation. CNN also reported that the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs would make involved agents available to the committee for sworn testimony, at which time they would be prepared to say the incident did not occur.[264] According to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, ""Some of the officers said that they would be coming and talking under oath ... [But] they have not come in"" and instead, Ornato, Engel, and the unnamed driver of the president\'s armored vehicle have all retained legal counsel.[265] (Months later, the committee interviewed the driver.)[266]\n\nOrnato led Trump\'s Secret Service detail until the president named him White House deputy chief of staff for operations in December 2019; Ornato took an unprecedented leave of absence from his civil service Secret Service position to accept the political appointment.[267][268] Politico reported two days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that members of the committee were skeptical of Ornato\'s credibility due to assertions made in his January and March depositions.[269] Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig, author of the 2021 book Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service, characterized Engel and Ornato as ""very, very close to President Trump."" During an MSNBC interview she stated: ""some people accused them of at times being enablers and \'yes men\' of the president—particularly Tony Ornato—and very much people who wanted to ... see him pleased."" Leonnig said there was a large contingent of Trump\'s Secret Service detail that wanted Biden to fail and some ""took to their personal media accounts to cheer on the insurrection and the individuals riding up to the Capitol as patriots.""[270] Two months after Hutchinson\'s testimony, Ornato, who was then serving as assistant director of the Secret Service, announced his retirement.[271] Ornato then testified to the committee that he didn\'t remember telling Hutchinson about any physical altercation between Trump and the limo driver. The committee wrote in its final report that it was ""difficult to fully reconcile the accounts"" from various witnesses regarding a physical altercation, though witnesses agreed that Trump had been angry.[272]\n\nTrump responded by attacking Hutchinson repeatedly on the Truth Social platform which he owns. He disputed the veracity of many of her statements and called her a ""liar"" and ""total phony.""[260] With regard to Trump\'s denials about Hutchinson\'s testimony, Fox News anchor Bret Baier noted on June 28: ""Cassidy Hutchinson is under oath on Capitol Hill. The President is on Truth Social ... [Her] testimony in and of itself is really, really powerful.""[273]\n\nOn the same day as Hutchinson\'s testimony, anonymous conspiracy theorist ""Q"" posted to 8kun,[274] claiming Hutchinson was involved in a plot to disparage Trump.[275][276] QAnon influencer Jordan Sather called Hutchinson a ""plant"", writing on his Telegram channel: ""Is Cassidy being used as a Trojan Horse to destroy the credibility of these hearings with her obviously fake testimony?""[277]\n\nIn response to the sixth hearing, conservative author David French wrote an article for The Dispatch titled ""The Case for Prosecuting Donald Trump Just Got Much Stronger."" According to The Guardian, ""In French\'s view, Trump demonstrably summoned the mob, knew it was armed and dangerous, told it to \'fight like hell\' and tried to march with it."" French wrote that ""Hutchinson\'s sworn testimony closes a gap in the criminal case ... Trump is closer to a credible prosecution than ever before.""[278][279]\n\nOn the day after Hutchinson\'s testimony, the Washington Examiner, a conservative publication widely read by Trump supporters, published an editorial entitled ""Trump proven unfit for power again."" The paper\'s board wrote, in part, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Tuesday testimony ought to ring the death knell for former President Donald Trump\'s political career ... Trump is a disgrace. Republicans have far better options to lead the party in 2024. No one should think otherwise, much less support him, ever again.""[280][281]\n\nSeventh hearing – July 12, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJason Van Tatenhove – Former national media director for the Oath Keepers until leaving the group in 2017\n\nStephen Ayres – Participant in the January 6 United States Capitol attack who pleaded guilty to disorderly and disruptive conduct\n\nSynopsis of seventh hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe seventh televised hearing presented links between then-President Donald Trump and the extreme domestic militias that helped coordinate the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.[3][20] The committee and panel of witnesses discussed ""the rise of the right-wing domestic violent extremist groups that attacked the Capitol and how Mr. Trump amassed and inspired the mob.""[3] In addition, the panel described ""known links and conversations between political actors close to Mr. Trump and extremists.""[3] Committee member Jamie Raskin stated, ""Donald Trump solicited the mob; he summoned the mob to Washington ... All of this was targeted on the joint session of Congress.""[3] It focused on testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, plotting by far-right extremist groups and discussions about using the military to seize voting machines.""[282] Jason Van Tatenhove, who served as media director of Oath Keepers, testified as well.[283][284] The focus of the hearing was connections, including Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, between the Trump administration and militia groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.[285]\n\nIn new disclosed videotaped testimony, Pat Cipollone described, among other things, an ""unhinged"" White House meeting which took place on December 18, 2020, between himself, Trump, Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn and Patrick M. Byrne, who he named as members of an outside group pushing election conspiracy theories, and that they exhibited a ""general disregard for backing what you actually say with facts.""[286] Cipollone testified that during the meeting, a draft executive order which would\'ve directed the U.S. military to seize voting machines was discussed.[287] A former Twitter employee who testified on anonymity also testified that Twitter, which Trump used to help organize the rally, “relished in the knowledge that they were also the favorite and most used service of the former president and enjoyed having that sort of power within the social media ecosystem” and that he was concerned about Trump\'s December 19, 2020, tweet which encouraged people to come to the ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.""[288] This tweet would lead to further solicitation of the January 6 rally on extremist Internet sources and right wing media.[289] One notable example came from Kelly Meggs, the head of the Florida Oath Keepers, who posted a message on Facebook pledging that his group would ""work together"" with the Three Percenters and Proud Boys, two other right-wing extremist groups, just hours after the tweet was posted.[289] Trump was also revealed to have posted the tweet not long after a meeting with Powell, Flynn and Rudy Giuliani had concluded.[288]\n\nIn videotaped testimony, former White House officials testified about an extremist rally which was held outside the White House at Freedom Plaza the night before the U.S. Capitol attack, which Sarah Matthews described as bringing Trump a good mood.[290] In their videotaped testimonies, former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia and Ivanka Trump stated that they called on Trump to concede the election after the Electoral College votes were cast in respective states on December 14, 2020, but were ignored.[291][292] Documented draft speeches were also revealed showing that Trump had in fact edited his January 6, 2021, Ellipse speech as well, to include negative words towards Vice President Mike Pence.[290] Important information about Roger Stone\'s direct links to Proud Boys, which included encrypted chats with the Proud Boys Florida leader and video evidence showing him appear with members and reciting the Proud Boys\' ""Fraternity Creed"", would be revealed as well.[293] Kellye SoRelle, a lawyer who assists the Oath Keepers and a volunteer attorney for the Trump campaign, named Stone, Info War\'s Alex Jones, and pro-Trump organizer Ali Alexander as the people who organized the January 2021 Stop the Steal rallies.[293] Footage of Stone, Jones, Alexander and Michael Flynn speaking at the January 5, 2021, Freedom Plaza rally were shown as well.[294]\n\nJason Van Tatenhove, who was first hired by the Oath Keepers in 2014, gave live testimony about the group\'s radicalization and how Stewart Rhodes, the group\'s founder, used conspiracy theories to increase membership and funding, stating that Oath Keepers drifted ""further and further right—into the alt-right world, into White nationalists and even straight-up racists and it came to a point where I could no longer continue to work for them"".[295] He said he finally decided to leave the group was when he heard members talking about how the Holocaust was not real.[295]\n\nA text message which rally organizer Kylie Kremer sent to election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell on January 4, 2021, and which was made public during the hearing, revealed that Trump would ""call for [the march] unexpectedly"" but they didn\'t want word to get out in advance in order to avoid a countermarch.[289] During his live testimony, Ohio resident Stephen Ayres, who participated in the riot despite not being affiliated with any extremist organization, noted how Trump ""got everybody riled up, told everybody to head on down"" and that ""We basically were just following what he said.""[289] Ayres also stated that he did not plan to go to the U.S. Capitol until Trump encouraged the Ellipse crowd to do so.[289]\n\nIn her closing statement, Liz Cheney stated that Donald Trump attempted to contact an unidentified witness who has yet to appear in the hearings, hinting at the possibility of witness tampering: ""That person declined to answer or respond to President Trump\'s call, and instead alerted their lawyer to the call. Their lawyer alerted us.

Mark Robinson, a former MPD police officer who was assigned to the presidential motorcade\'s lead TS vehicle on January 6, 2021.[304] Robinson stated that he was told firsthand that Trump got into a ""heated discussion"" about wanting to go to the U.S. Capitol.[304]\n\nSarah Matthews, deputy press secretary in the Trump White House, and Matthew Pottinger,[305] who served on the National Security Council, testified in person. Both had resigned shortly after the attack on the Capitol.[306] Evidence and details were presented of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack, in spite of numerous pleas from officials, for hours.[307] Never-before-seen footage of Trump\'s January 7, 2021, speech criticizing the January 6 attack was also released which revealed Trump\'s hesitance to make the speech as it was written.[308] Former White House advisor, as well as Trump son-in-law, Jared Kushner stated in videotaped testimony that House of Representatives leader Kevin McCarthy pleaded for White House intervention during a January 6 phone call and that he thought McCarthy was ""scared.""[309] A newly disclosed January 6 text message between Donald Trump Jr. and Mark Meadows revealed that Trump Jr. wanted his father to ""condemn this shit"" and ""go to the mattresses,"" a film reference which Trump Jr. claimed during video testimony he thought meant ""go all in.""[310] Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney stated, ""Every American must consider this ... Can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of Jan. 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?"". Committee Chair Thompson said, ""If there is no accountability for Jan. 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy ... There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.""[22]\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Cheney said, ""In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward ... Doors have opened. New subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break ... We have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people and more to gather ... So our committee will spend August pursuing emerging information on multiple fronts before convening further hearings this September.""[311]\n\nNinth hearing – October 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger (R-IL 16th)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nAdam Schiff (D-CA 28th)\n\nStephanie Murphy (D-FL 7th)\n\nJared Kushner - former White House advisor, voice only\n\nBill Stepien - former Trump campaign manager, in video\n\nGreg Jacob - former counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, in video - pled 5th\n\nJason Miller - former senior campaign staffer, in video\n\nChris Stirewalt - a former Fox News political editor, video of previous January 6th heating.\n\nMark Milley - General, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voice only.\n\nAlyssa Farah - former White House communications director, in video\n\nCassidy Hutchinson - former aide to Mark Meadows, in video\n\nKeith Kellogg - former national security advisor to Vice President Pence, in video.\n\nJohn McEntee - former director, White House Presidential Personnel, in video.\n\nDouglas Macgregor - former advisor to the Secretary of Defense, in video.\n\nAlex Cannon- former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMatt Morgan - former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMike Pompeo - former Secretary of State, in video.\n\nIvanka Trump - voice only.\n\nWilliam Barr - former Attorney General, in video.\n\nJudd Deere - former White House Deputy Press Secretary, in video\n\nEugene Scalia - former Secretary of Labor, in video\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nDonald Trump - in video, in audio, and written communications\n\nGreg Jacob - in written memo for Marc Short\n\nTom Fitton - written communications in an email to Molly Michael and Dan Scavino\n\nSteve Bannon - Trump outside advisor, voice and video interviews with media.\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, video footage, and written communications\n\nAmy Berman Jackson - Judge, January 6th defendant sentencing hearing\n\nKelly and Connie Meggs - in written documents\n\nMike Pence - former Vice President, in video speech at Federalist Society 4th February 2022\n\nSynopsis of ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth televised hearing was held October 13, 2022, at 1 pm Eastern time. It was originally scheduled for September 28[312][313] but postponed due to the devastation of Hurricane Ian.[314][315] The hearing focused on evidence and testimony regarding Trump\'s involvement in events surrounding the attack of the Capitol, as well as information on the controversial website ""thedonald.win"", newly released videos of Nancy Pelosi, her Congress members, and lawmakers at their secure location during the attack, newly released videos on the rioters\' reactions to Trump\'s ""go home"" message, and newly released texts from Secret Service agents demonstrating the awareness and warning signals about potential threats to both Pence and Congress in advance of January 6.[27][28][316] The committee was also expecting to vote on its next investigation steps, and unanimously voted to subpoena Trump to make him testify.[27][28][317]\n\nAmong those shown in video testimony footage were former Trump Administration officials Mick Mulvaney and Elaine Chao.[316] Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Washington, also gave video testimony about what she claimed Kevin McCarthy told her about his phone conversation with Trump, which Mulvaney corroborated.[316] Video testimony was also shown of former Twitter employee Anika Navaroli, who was revealed to have previously testified anonymously.[316] Although the committee had already interviewed Ginni Thomas, it didn\'t feature any of her testimony in this public hearing.[318] Video of Roger Stone was also presented, as well as evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] Stone was also shown endorsing ""the right to violence.""[319]\n\nPrior to the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth hearing—which the committee had planned to hold since July[320]—included further details regarding ""the potential unauthorized deletion"" of text messages, particularly those from January 5 and 6, 2021, by the United States Secret Service, which has been headed by Director James M. Murray, a Trump appointee.[321][322][323][324] Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, a Trump appointee, alerted Congress on July 13, 2022, that Secret Service communication records had been deleted, following a months-long delay in reporting the matter.[325][326] According to The Washington Post, the whistleblowers who revealed this delay said they ""shared a concern that Cuffari\'s office not alerting congressional investigators to the missing records reduced the chances of recovering critical pieces of evidence related to the Jan. 6 attack.""[322][327]\n\nOn August 1, 2022, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson reiterated calls for Cuffari to step down due to a ""lack of transparency"" that could be ""jeopardizing the integrity"" of crucial investigations regarding the missing Secret Service text messages.[328] That same day, an official inside the DHS inspector general\'s office told Politico that Cuffari and his staff are ""uniquely unqualified to lead an Inspector General\'s office, and ... The crucial oversight mission of the DHS OIG has been compromised.""[329] Congress also obtained a July 2021 e-mail, from deputy inspector general Thomas Kait, who told senior DHS officials there was no longer a need for any Secret Service phone records or text messages. Efforts to collect communications related to Jan. 6 were therefore shutdown by Kait just six weeks after the internal DHS investigation began. The Guardian wrote that ""Taken together, the new revelations appear to show that the chief watchdog for the Secret Service and the DHS took deliberate steps to stop the retrieval of texts it knew were missing, and then sought to hide the fact that it had decided not to pursue that evidence.""[330]\n\nText messages from January 6, 2021, were deleted from the phones of Trump-appointed officials at the Pentagon after the watchdog group American Oversight filed FOIA requests to obtain the messages. This was not addressed in the July hearings because it was first reported on August 2.[331][332]\n\nOn August 29, 2022, Representative Kinzinger had stated in a Meet the Press interview that the next public hearings would focus on donations Trump solicited for the ""Stop The Steal"" movement but did not use for that purpose, as well as on the possible Secret Service coverup.[333]\n\nAftermath of the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Politico reported that they had obtained some of John Eastman\'s e-mail correspondences. The series of messages were from December 31, 2020, and had been turned over to congressional investigators, but had not yet been made public. In one exchange, Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro wrote ""We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue some sort of stay or other circuit justice opinion saying Georgia is in legitimate doubt"", and posited that Justice Thomas would be their ""only chance to get a favorable judicial opinion by Jan. 6, which might hold up the Georgia count in Congress"". Attorney John Eastman replied ""I think I agree with this"", saying that they needed to ""kick the Georgia legislature into gear"" in order to favor Trump and overturn election results. The plan was to file a lawsuit and have a pending case with the Supreme Court, thus delaying the Senate\'s count of Biden\'s electors. Chesebro wrote that Justice Thomas would be the key figure necessary, if the plan were to succeed, because he would be the justice assigned to dealing with any emergency legal matters sent to the southeastern region\'s Eleventh Circuit court.[334][335]\n\nTrump subpoena\n\n[edit]\n\nThe January 6 Committee\'s subpoena for testimony and related documents was formally issued to Trump on October 21, 2022.[336] Under the subpoena, the committee demanded that Trump hand over documents related to communications with Roger Stone, John Eastman, and others by November 4, and requested testimony by November 14. The committee also specified that they wanted ""information sufficient to identify every telephone or other communications device"" used by Trump between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021.[337][338]\n\nOn November 11, 2022, Trump sued the House select committee and challenged the subpoena, seeking to block testimony and submission of documents. Chairman Bennie Thompson has called the legal effort a ""delay tactic"".[339][340][341]\n\nThe committee\'s official legal capacity to conduct their investigation expired on December 31, 2022. Just days before the end of December, the committee formally withdrew Trump\'s subpoena. Chairman Thompson said ""... the select committee has concluded its hearings, released its final report and ... In light of the imminent end of our investigation, the select committee can no longer pursue the specific information covered by the subpoena"".[342]\n\nTenth hearing – December 19, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nSynopsis of tenth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFull-length video of the tenth and final public hearing of the Select Committee. (Source: January 6th Committee\'s channel on YouTube).\n\nThe tenth and final televised public hearing was held on December 19, 2022, at 1 pm Eastern time. A compilation of video clips, including footage of the riot and witness depositions, was shown.[343]\n\nEach committee member then made a live ""opening statement"":\n\nChairman Thompson confirmed that the final report will be released later in the week, and that the report will have ""a bulk"" of the select committee\'s findings.\n\nVice Chair Cheney elaborated on the history and importance of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nRep. Lofgren summarized the details regarding the ""Big Lie"" tactics.\n\nRep. Schiff outlined the details of Trump\'s interference at the state level, Trump\'s fake electors plan, and the targeting of election workers.\n\nRep Kinzinger detailed regarding the DOJ pressure campaign by Trump and his allies, including to the January 3rd attempt of appointing Jeffrey Clark as acting Attorney General of the DOJ.\n\nRep. Aguilar reviewed Trump\'s pressure campaign on state officials, Congress, and even Vice-President Pence to take ""unlawful action"" in overturning the election results.\n\nRep. Murphy discussed how Trump summoned the crowd to Washington, D.C., on January 6 and how his tweets ""galvanized"" violent extremists.\n\nRep. Luria recapped Trump\'s 187 minutes of inaction and dereliction of duty.\n\nRep. Raskin elaborated on the subcommittee\'s work and their consideration, reasoning, and evidence for criminal referrals. They recommended that Trump be charged with four crimes:[344] 18 U.S.C § 1512(c),[345] 18 U.S.C § 371,[346] 18 U.S.C § 1001,[347] and 18 U.S.C § 2383.[348] (These are: Obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and ""incite,"" ""assist"" or ""aid or comfort"" an insurrection.)[349][350] Raskin also stated that the subcommittee\'s work had been limited by the lack of cooperation, and hopes the DOJ can use the subcommittee\'s work for their own investigation.\n\nThe committee also referred John Eastman.[351]\n\nNewer, previously un-televised video testimony from Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway was shown as well.[352] In her testimony, Hicks, who was Trump\'s White House communications director, claimed that Trump at one point told her ""something along the lines of \'nobody will care about my legacy if I lose ... the only thing that matters is winning.\'""[353] Conway, in her testimony, claimed that she briefly spoke with Trump the day after the Capitol attack and that he said his supporters were upset.[354]\n\nThe committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (California), Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Scott Perry (Pennsylvania), and Andy Biggs (Arizona) refusing to answer subpoenas.[31]\n\nImmediately after the hearing, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its findings.[33][34][35] It said it was ready to release its final report. The vote of the committee was unanimous.[349][350]\n\nMedia coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, ""The eight hearings held by the House committee investigating the ... attack on the U.S. Capitol have been riveting to watch—and even more remarkably, they have captured the daily news cycle again and again, not only finding substantial TV and streaming audiences as they aired but also consistently landing at the top of broadcast and cable news reports and of newspaper front pages."" The Post referenced several factors for the popularity of the hearings, stating that ""Each hearing has produced at least one legitimate nugget of actual news, and sometimes more than one."" They cited the importance of the brisk pace of the hearings which ""move[d] expeditiously from brief opening statements to video or live testimony"" and without extemporaneous speeches or tedious delays. Liz Cheney was called ""a compelling central character"" with ""steely resolve and understated intensity"" who ""is hard to look away from."" The Post also gave some importance to timing, saying that ""other major news stories of recent months ... have not occurred on the same dates as the hearings themselves.""[355]\n\nAccording to CNN, ""the committee has certainly succeeded in keeping the attention of America\'s political junkies. Trump devotees are the exception to that rule, but even they have dropped the \'nobody\'s watching the hearings\' talking point that was trotted out in June. In a streaming and on-demand world, the total reach of the hearings to date is unknowable, but many tens of millions of Americans have soaked up the committee\'s findings, which is no small thing in a fractured media space.""[356]\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nJune 9 viewership[357] Network Viewers ABC 5,215,000 MSNBC 4,303,000 NBC 3,696,000 CBS 3,490,000 FNC 3,062,000 CNN 2,740,000 FBN 223,000 CNBC 158,000 Newsmax 137,000 NewsNation 125,000\n\nBroadcast networks Cable news networks\n\nThe first public hearing of 2022 was carried live by all the major networks except Fox News.[358] Mediated live coverage was provided by major broadcast television networks ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as cable channels such as C-SPAN, CNN, Fox Business Network, MSNBC, and Newsmax, as well as news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Television, and ABC TV (Australian TV channel), and free streaming channels such as NBC News NOW, and LiveNOW from Fox via YouTube and other live streaming outlets.[4][359] Nielsen Media Research estimates that at least 20 million households watched the first hearing on traditional television, comparable to the average rating for NBC Sunday Night Football, which ranks as television\'s number one program.[360]\n\nFox News alternate coverage during hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nInstead of airing the hearing live, the Fox broadcast network stuck with repeats of its regularly scheduled programming, while Fox News broadcast Tucker Carlson Tonight and Hannity without commercial breaks for the entire two-hour hearing.[361] During Carlson\'s show, he repeated false claims[362][363] about FBI involvement,[364] stating that federal agents had instigated the violence during the January 6 riots.[365]\n\nOn Sean Hannity\'s show, he referred to the January 6 House Select Committee hearing as a ""boring ... Hollywood production"" and blamed the Capitol Police for their inability to defend the U.S. Capitol Building and prevent mob violence.[366]\n\nThe New York Times observed that by ""not carrying the hearings live in prime time"" Fox News was able to avoid a potentially ""awkward on-screen moment.""[367] During the weeks following the 2020 election, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity promoted Trump\'s election fraud narrative.[368][369] Previously disclosed text messages between Hannity and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were presented during the hearing, which revealed a coordinated internal strategy and agreed-upon public messaging campaign with the Fox News host.[370][371][372][further explanation needed]\n\nNPR\'s David Folkenflik said coverage of the hearing would have required Fox News to ""broadcast flat contradictions of what many leading Fox News personalities have told their audiences in the past year and a half.""[361] Chris Hayes, of MSNBC, condemned Fox News saying they ""went to great lengths"" by not airing the hearing and that the network simultaneously countered the findings of the House Select Committee investigation by doing ""everything in their power to make sure their viewers were shielded from the brutal truth about the violent coup that Donald Trump fomented.""[358] For example, Hayes said their skipping of commercial breaks would cost the network unknown thousands of dollars but tended to keep viewers from switching to the other networks, where they would have found live hearing coverage.[358]\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nThe eighth public hearing of 2022—and the second to be aired live on primetime—had nearly 17.7 million viewers.[373] After his video testimony aired, Donald Trump Jr., who testified that he was among those tried to encourage his father to denounce the attack on the U.S. Capitol, was greatly mocked on social media for misinterpreting what The Godfather\'s line ""go to the mattresses"" meant;[374] Newsweek journalist Tom Norton even noted that ""Such descriptions arguably paint Trump in the same brush strokes as a crime boss.""[310]\n\nTelevised production and viewership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States House Select Committee contracted James Goldston, former president of ABC News, as an advisor to help produce the public hearings and present the findings with a polished televised format.[375][376] According to the Nielsen ratings, ""In total, each of the eight hearings averaged 13.1 million viewers ... The two prime time hearings averaged 18.9 million viewers per hearing, and the other six hearings, which were daytime broadcasts, averaged 11.2 million viewers per hearing.""[377]\n\nNewspaper coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New York Times presented a detailed summary of the eight hearings held in June and July 2022.[22] A ninth hearing was convened in October.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/slain-wife-of-former-north-attleboro-man-featured-in-congressional-probe-of-jan-6/article_d82be5bc-4caa-5849-a5eb-40df65672eda.html', 'Headline': 'Slain wife of former North Attleboro man featured in Congressional ...', 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt Twitter Former North Attleboro resident Aaron Babbitt is shown with his wife, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed during the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol.', 'Full_text': ''}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/capitol-rioter-photographed-pelosis-podium-jan-6-sentenced-prison-rcna17409', 'Headline': ""Capitol rioter photographed with Pelosi's podium on Jan. 6 sentenced to ..."", 'Snippet': 'Adam Johnson bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying Nancy Pelosi\'s lectern during the attack on the U.S. Capitol. ... where Ashli Babbitt was shot — to 75 days in prison.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — A Florida man who bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s podium during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was sentenced to 75 days in prison on Friday.\n\nAdam Johnson, a stay-at-home father of five boys, traveled to D.C. in support of former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to President Joe Biden. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton sentenced Johnson to prison on Friday, saying Johnson made ""a mockery"" of the events by grabbing Pelosi\'s lectern and played an active role in the attack. Walton said he just couldn\'t overlook Johnson\'s behavior, which he said was deserving of a period of incarceration. Johnson will get credit for some time he\'s already served, and will also pay a $5,000 fine.\n\n""We\'re on a dangerous slide in America,"" Walton said Friday, calling what happened on Jan. 6 something you\'d expect to ""see in banana republics."" Walton asked Johnson how he could hold himself out as a good role model for his five children when he came to D.C. and did what he did on Jan. 6.\n\nJohnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he\'d been ""nothing but cooperative"" with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was ""ashamed"" to have been a part of the Capitol riot.\n\nJohnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he\'d be ""on a firing wall instead of a courtroom."" He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.\n\n""If I did find her, I would ask for a selfie with her, if anything,"" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson pleaded guilty to a criminal count of entering and remained in a restricted building or grounds, admitting that he unlawfully entered the Capitol after witnessing battles with police outside the building, and then grabbed Pelosi\'s podium ""because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture."" Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ""a great battering ram"" as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Arco told the court Friday that Johnson\'s conduct deserves prison time. She played a video of Johnson jiggling the door of what he thought was Pelosi\'s office. There can be no question, Arco said, that Johnson knew he was part of a violent mob.\n\n""Mr. Johnson was part of a mob,"" Arco said. ""He knew that.”\n\nJustice Department prosecutors argued in a memo ahead of his sentencing that Johnson\'s actions illustrated his ""sense of entitlement and privilege"" and that he appeared ""defiant and righteous in his trespassing, which he celebrated by posting this photo to Facebook."" Federal prosecutors had requested a sentence of 90 days behind bars.\n\nJohnson\'s attorneys claimed in their own filing that Johnson ""deeply regrets his participation in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6"" and that the ""damage and violence inflicted on that date by others is contrary to everything he believes in."" They argued that his five children would be negatively impacted by his imprisonment, and that Johnson received extra scrutiny because the lectern he grabbed belonged to the speaker of House.\n\n""Unfortunately, he received considerable attention simply because the lectern belonged to Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi,"" they wrote. ""Arguably, if he latched onto some other piece of government furniture for his photo opportunity jail time would not even be a consideration.""\n\nThe FBI has arrested more than 740 people in connection with the U.S. Capitol attack, out of more than 2,500 individuals who engaged in chargeable criminal conduct that day. Sentences have ranged from probationary sentences and fines for misdemeanor defendants to five years in federal prison for Robert Scott Palmer, who attacked officers with a fire extinguisher and received the longest sentence of any Capitol rioter so far.'}}",91.125,1

I will not do it.”\n\nBowers said that when he met with Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani, he pressed them for names of people they claimed had voted illegally in Arizona, but they never had any evidence, just “lots of theories.”\n\nTuesday’s focus reviewed how Trump was repeatedly told his pressure campaign could potentially cause violence against the local officials and their families but pursued it anyway, according to a committee aide.\n\nAnd it underscored that fallout from Trump’s lies continues, with election officers facing ongoing public harassment and political challengers trying to take over their jobs.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/youre-one-arizonas-fake-electors-132532224.html', 'Headline': ""If you're one of Arizona's fake electors, Monday could be a no ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'Meanwhile in Wisconsin, 10 fake electors settled a civil l awsuit this week, admitting their actions were part of a scheme to overturn Biden’s victory.

He also agreed to turn over all emails and text messages to prosecutors.\n\nNow he’s apparently coming clean about his part in the conspiracy elsewhere.\n\nHis testimony could be key in Arizona\n\nNevada is the third state to bring criminal charges against its fake electors, following Michigan and Georgia. Chesebro is listed as a witness in the indictments.\n\nAnd Arizona?\n\nThe Post reports he’ll be here on Monday.\n\n“My client, Kenneth Chesebro, will travel anywhere in the United States to tell the truth about what happened leading up to the events of Jan. 6, 2021,” Robert Langford, his Nevada attorney, told the Post last week.\n\nChesebro’s testimony could be be key.\n\nAccording to his Fulton County, Ga., indictment, one of Chesebro’s memos “provides detailed, state-specific instructions for how Trump presidential elector nominees in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would meet and cast electoral votes” for Trump, even though he lost the election in those states.\n\nThose memos “evolved over time from a legal strategy to preserve (Trump’s) rights to a corrupt plan to subvert the federal government function by stopping Biden electors’ votes from being counted and certified.”\n\nHow did that 'corrupt plan' evolve here?\n\nI, for one, would love to know how that evolution played out here in Arizona.\n\nSpecifically, how Arizona’s 11 Trump electors came to be meeting at state Republican Party headquarters on Dec. 14, 2020, signing documents falsely claiming to be “duly elected and qualified” to cast Arizona’s electoral votes for the guy who didn’t win.\n\nHow these “patriots” — including two who are now state senators (Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern), the now-former chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party (Kelli Ward) and a top executive with Turning Point USA (Tyler Bowyer) — came up with the same wild idea that just coincidentally occurred to Republicans in six other swing states won by Biden.\n\nOr how, even as those phonies were meeting in Phoenix to cast their non-existent votes for Trump, across town a group of Republican legislators were signing a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Congress urging them to accept Arizona’s “alternate” electoral votes.\n\nIn all, 29 incoming and outgoing Republican legislators signed the request, calling it “A Joint Resolution of the 54th Legislature” and attaching the state seal so it would look official.\n\nThe plot involved more than 11 fake electors\n\nI’d also be curious how then-Rep. Mark Finchem, one of the state’s loudest stop the stealers, came to be hand carrying the lawmakers’ request to Washington on Jan. 5, 2021, putting it into the hands of one of Trump’s strongest acolytes on Capitol Hill, Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nOr how Biggs came to be videoconferencing with Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to sign onto the legislators’ request and support the decertification of Arizona’s vote.\n\nBowers declined.\n\nBiggs went forth anyway, joining with Reps. Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and more than 140 esteemed members of Congress to reject Arizona’s vote.\n\nYou begin to understand those reports that Biggs sought a presidential pardon, though he denies it.\n\nArizona’s fake electors have mostly laid low since details of this scam on America have trickled out. Their enablers and supporters insist they were merely a backup plan, casting Arizona’s electoral votes for Trump in the event that lawsuits challenging the election were successful.\n\nFake electors, beware: A Trump ally is ready to come clean\n\nThat might actually work if we were in Pennsylvania or New Mexico, where the Trump electors added that caveat to the official certifications they sent to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nIn New Mexico, the Trump electors signed, “on the understanding that it might later be determined that [they] are the duly elected and qualified Electors.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, they said their votes for Trump should count only “if, as a result of a final non-appealable court order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified electors.”\n\nMayes should broaden her investigation\n\nBut Arizona’s fake electors offered no such hedge. They signed documents simply declaring themselves “duly elected and qualified electors” and casting their votes for the guy who didn’t win.\n\nMe? I’m hoping Mayes will broaden her investigation to look beyond the 11 “electors” who so proudly put their name to a fake document.\n\nThis wasn’t just 11 rubes who decided on a whim to protest Biden’s win by casting a symbolic electoral vote for Trump.\n\nThis was a carefully planned scheme, meticulously coordinated — from the seeds of doubt deeply planted to erode trust in our elections to the fake electors who were part of a plot to steal the vote in Arizona and other swing states to the storming of the nation’s Capitol to stop Joe Biden from becoming president.\n\nI’m guessing Kenneth Chesebro knows exactly what happened here, and on Monday he’ll be in Phoenix.\n\nThat thump you just heard?

They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/dec/15/ron-johnson/johnsons-claim-dems-used-alternative-slates-of-ele/', 'Headline': ""Wisconsin senator's claim that Dems used alternative slates of electors ..."", 'Snippet': 'Vice President Mike Pence hands the electoral certificate from the state of Arizona to Sen.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is still defending their actions — even after the group in a court filing acknowledged the group’s actions were used to try to overturn the election.\n\nIn a Dec. 11 interview on CNN, Johnson was asked if Robert Spindell, who serves on the Wisconsin Elections Commission and was one of the fake electors, should resign from his position for participating in the scheme.\n\nJohnson said Spindell shouldn’t resign, there was an ""active court case"" and there were ""all kinds of irregularities in Wisconsin in the 2020 election.""\n\n""In order to make sure that the case wasn’t determined to be moot, they had to have an alternate slate of electors just like Democrats have done repeatedly in all kinds of different states,"" Johnson said. ""There’s nothing untoward about what they did. There was nothing illegal about what they did. They were just an alternate slate of electors.""\n\nKaitlan Collins, host of ""The Source wuth Kaitlan Collins"" on CNN, pushed back, asking whether he meant they did nothing wrong.\n\n""These folks did nothing different than Democrats have done in many states,"" Johnson said.\n\nCollins then asked whether a person who participated in the fake electors scheme should remain on a state board.\n\n""Democrat electors have done that repeatedly,"" Johnson said, ignoring the question. ""It’s happened in different states.""\n\nIs Johnson right that that Democrats have also used alternate slates of electors ""repeatedly in all kinds of different states""\n\nIn a word: No.\n\nJohnson’s response\n\nWhen we asked Johnson’s office to back up the claim, which created a lot of conversation on social media, spokesperson Kiersten Pels said ""the senator meant that Democrats have ‘repeatedly’ been denying and challenging elections for decades and cited the below examples in a tweet response to CNN.""\n\nBut that’s not what Johnson said, and it’s not what viewers heard. If anything, it’s an acknowledgement that, at best, the senator misspoke.\n\nThe response Pels referred to included four examples. We’ll take a look at them, through the prism of the claim Johnson made on CNN.\n\nThey fall short. For instance, only one of the four even involves a slate of electors.\n\n1960 election: Hawaii electors\n\nJohnson asserted: ""In the 1960 election, Democrats in Hawaii chose an alternative slate of electors, allowing JFK to be certified as the winner.""\n\nThat election, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy defeated Republican Richard Nixon, is one of the most memorably close presidential elections in U.S. history.\n\nHere is some background from a Aug. 25 Politico article, which sought to debunk the same sort of comparison, which other Republicans were advancing.\n\nIn December 1960, Hawaii’s election results were still in doubt. Nixon was leading by 140 votes with a recount underway. At the same time, presidential electors were meeting to cast their ballots, as law requires. Hawaii electors for both Nixon and Kennedy met separately to cast their votes for their respective candidates and sent them to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe recount put Kennedy ahead by roughly 115 votes, giving him the state. The results were then certified and a new slate of Electoral College certificates were signed and sent to Washington.\n\nBut the Hawaii electors were chosen, on the date prescribed by law, while the recount was underway and the result was still in question. In Wisconsin, the Republican fake electors met after a Trump-backed recount failed. A few days after they met the state supreme court ruled Joe Biden as the winner in Wisconsin.\n\nSo, contrary to Johnson’s assertion, it was not the alternate slate of electors that allowed Kennedy to be chosen. It was the result of the recount. What’s more, Nixon himself — then the vice president — had slates of electors from both parties before him, and chose the Democratic one after the Hawaii recount was completed and certified for Kennedy.\n\n2004 election: Republican George W. Bush and Democrat John Kerry\n\nJohnson asserted: In 2005, Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones led a group of 31 representatives in objecting to the certification of Ohio’s electors. Those 31 include Jim Clyburn, Sheila Jackson Lee, Barbara Lee, now-Sen. Ed Markey, Benny Thompson and Maxine Waters.\n\nJohnson has the facts right, but applies them incorrectly to support his CNN claim. The Democrats objected to a rightfully-chosen slate of electors. They did not offer an alternate slate of electors.\n\n2016 election: ""Rogue electors"" discuss trying to block Trump\n\nJohnson asserted: ""In 2016, Democrat electors from Washington state and Colorado signed onto an attempt to block Trump from winning an Electoral College majority.""\n\nWhen Trump won in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton, many Democrats were upset at the results.\n\nAfter the election, Politico reported in Nov. 2016, some Democrat electors were trying to rally support for other electors to not vote for Trump — this was what was termed ""rogue electors"" at the time. Likewise, some electors considered not voting for Clinton in states Clinton won.\n\nAgain, this is not a slate of fake electors.\n\n2016 election: More anti-Trump fallout\n\nJohnson’s final assertion: ""In 2017, Reps. Jamie Raskin, Pramila Jayapal, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Raúl Grijalva, Maxine Waters, and Jim McGovern, all objected to electoral votes for Trump.""\n\nAs in 2005, when the formal certification process was underway in Congress, some Democrats in the House objected to the electoral votes that were cast for Trump.\n\nBiden, then vice president, presided over the joint body, heard the objections and at one point told Jayapal, who objected to Georgia’s vote certificate, ""it is over.""\n\nAgain, this did not involve a slate of fake electors.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that after the 2020 election many Republicans objected to certifying various electoral votes for Biden. Indeed, that was part of the overall scheme — to have alternate slates of electors put in front of then-Vice President Mike Pence, so he could accept them instead of the legitimate ones.\n\nJohnson’s role with fake electors\n\nIt’s worth noting Johnson will always be connected with the issue, based on a text exchange that was revealed by the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack at the capitol.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Sean Riley, a Johnson aide, texted Chris Hodgson, a Pence staff member, saying Johnson ""needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise.""\n\n""What is it?"" Hodgson responded.\n\n""Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn\'t receive them,"" Riley said.\n\n""Do not give that to him,"" Hodgson said.\n\nHours later the U.S. Capitol was under siege by Trump supporters hoping to delay the Electoral College vote count and overturn the election.\n\nJohnson has changed his explanation of his involvement from having ""no involvement in an alternate slate of electors"" to admitting he was made aware of ""Wisconsin electors"" by a Dane County attorney and facilitated a text message introduction with a staff member and the attorney.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a CNN interview, Johnson claimed Democrats have also used alternate slates of electors ""repeatedly in all kinds of different states.""\n\nThat is wrong. His own aide acknowledged that Johnson meant to make a different point, a more general one about Democrats objecting to past election results. And, in any case, none of the evidence Johnson provided matches the original claim.\n\nWe rate the claim False.\n\nEditor\'s note: This fact check has been corrected to reflect the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled for Biden after the alternate electors met.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/07/what-are-fake-electors.html', 'Headline': 'How the Fake Electors Scheme Was Supposed to Work', 'Snippet': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers also said Trump pressured him to reconvene the Arizona Legislature and recall electors who were going to vote for Biden (Bowers refused). Advertisement', 'Full_text': 'You may be hearing the phrase “fake electors scheme” a lot lately—in fact, just this week, 16 people in Michigan were charged with a slew of felonies because of it. The “scheme” has also been under investigation by the Department of Justice since last year. But what exactly is it?\n\nIt’s a plan allegedly devised by Donald Trump, his lawyers, and his advisers to overturn the 2020 election results and keep Trump in the White House for another term, despite Joe Biden winning the general election.\n\nThe details are a bit convoluted. We’re here to fill you in.\n\nPart I: Seed Doubt\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 election, there were signs that Trump might not accept an election loss. When asked, Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Instead, he seeded doubt in the integrity of the U.S. voting system, specifically mail-in ballots. “I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, frankly, there’ll be a continuation,” said Trump. Around that time, a group of bipartisan experts had produced a white paper laying out scenarios of how Trump could react to an election loss, predicting a constitutional crisis. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also warned the country of a “nightmare scenario” where Trump refused to step down from the presidency despite losing the election.\n\nSure enough, as it became clear in the days and weeks following the Nov. 3, 2020, election that Biden was going to become the next U.S. president, Trump’s camp began to target seven battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—where Biden had won. According to evidence presented during the House Jan. 6 committee hearings, Trump adviser Kenneth Chesebro was the one to initially suggest this plan, and he pulled in attorneys John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and other Trump allies like chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn to help execute it.\n\nPart II: Lawsuits and Demands for Recounts\n\nTrump and his allies launched 62 legal challenges in battleground states. But 61 failed; one Pennsylvania judge ruled that voters couldn’t go back and “cure” their ballots, if they had failed to provide proper identification, within three days after the election. The decision didn’t change Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nUndeterred, the Trump camp asked for the support of local Republican officials, who are in charge of facilitating their local elections. Trump infamously called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and demanded he “find 11,780 votes,” the exact number needed to win over Biden. Trump also personally contacted the speaker of the Pennsylvania House, Bryan Cutler, to request his help in reversing his state’s election results.\n\nGiuliani also addressed the Georgia Legislature in an attempt to convince them that Georgia’s election results had been skewed by fraud. Meadows traveled to Georgia to watch an audit of absentee ballots and sent the Department of Justice multiple emails alleging voter fraud and requesting investigations be started.\n\nPart III: Assemble Electors\n\nBefore an election, political parties in each state choose their electors—the people who will represent them in the Electoral College, should their candidate win. Most states award all of their electors to the party that earns the most votes, except for Nebraska and Maine, which send a proportional distribution of electors from both parties.\n\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, all the electors gather in their respective states to officially enter their votes for president. They record the vote on an official certificate, called the Certificate of Ascertainment, which they send to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Constitution does not actually require electors to vote according to their state’s popular vote, but since the winning party got to choose them in advance, it’s pretty rare for them not to. Some states have also passed laws that penalize “faithless electors.”\n\nThis process usually runs smoothly, but there have been instances of trouble.\n\nIn 1960, when Sen. John F. Kennedy was running against Vice President Richard Nixon, the race was so tight that the Kennedy campaign demanded a recount in Hawaii, despite Nixon winning the state. As the recount took place, both campaigns organized their chosen slates of electors and sent signed certificates to Congress. Once the recount finished, Hawaii flipped for Kennedy, which then sent a second round of official electors and a new certificate to Washington, D.C.\n\nAs vice president, Nixon was also president of the Senate, and faced three different slates of electors, but chose to honor Kennedy’s.\n\nThe Trump campaign argued this set a precedent for them to object to states’ election results and put forth their own slates of electors. Though their excuse for doing so—the claims of voter fraud—had been widely disproven, the Trump campaign allegedly played a hand in assembling a hodgepodge of local Republicans in each of the seven battleground states to serve as fake electors.\n\nRepublican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel testified before the Jan. 6 Commission that Trump called her asking for the RNC’s help in gathering pro-Trump electors across the country. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers also said Trump pressured him to reconvene the Arizona Legislature and recall electors who were going to vote for Biden (Bowers refused).\n\nAt the time, however, the government’s top cybersecurity agency refuted Trump’s allegations of widespread voter fraud. And Trump’s own attorney general, Bill Barr, rejected the claims as “bullshit.” A Department of Justice investigation completed in 2022 also ultimately found no evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nEven states that were more forgiving to Trump could not stand by his claims. The state of Georgia went through three rounds of recounts and Biden remained the clear winner every time. The same goes for Arizona, which held a hand recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County and found Biden actually gained 99 more votes.\n\nAlthough many Republican officials across all seven states refused to bend to Trump’s demands, Trump supporters in all seven battleground states, who had no authority to act as state electors, still signed fake certificates declaring Trump as their state’s winner and sent them to the National Archives.\n\nPart IV: Convince the Vice President\n\nAll of these efforts would be futile unless the vice president would play along. On Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, was scheduled to preside over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots. It’s mostly a ceremonial role, but Trump and his allies were convinced Pence had the authority to throw out the legitimate electoral votes for Biden and only count Trump’s fake ones, though the law does not explicitly grant him that authority.\n\nThe pressure campaign culminated in the days before the attack on the Capitol. Testimony from the House Jan. 6 committee revealed that Eastman, one of Trump’s lead lawyers, told Pence directly in an Oval Office meeting, “I’m here to request that you reject the electors.”\n\nPence did not oblige Eastman’s request, and days later, on Jan. 6, an angry mob of Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence.” Trump allegedly said the vice president “deserves it.”\n\nIn the end, the fake electors were not considered in Congress—despite an aide for Republican Sen. Ron Johnson attempting to hand them to Pence minutes before the electoral vote count started—and soon enough the world learned of Trump’s plan.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nAmerican Oversight, a progressive watchdog group, reported on this plan in March 2021 when, through a records request, they got their hands on copies of phony electoral vote certificates from the seven battleground states. Almost a year later, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow also revealed the scheme on her show.\n\nThen came the House Jan. 6 committee, which, through a series of public hearings, revealed some pretty shocking details. For example, when Bowers, Arizona’s governor, testified, he alleged that Republican Rep. Andy Biggs called him the morning of Jan. 6 to try to convince him to sign on to a fake slate of electors, a request he refused.\n\nThe committee voted to refer Trump to the DOJ on at least four criminal charges, handing over all of its evidence and transcripts. That’s when the department decided to appoint special counsel Jack Smith to investigate whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 election or the Electoral College vote certification.

Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, was the site of a controversial audit commissioned by the GOP-led Arizona Senate that affirmed Biden’s victory but led to a referral to the state’s attorney general to investigate “urgent issues.”\n\nStill, Finchem insisted in a statement about the resolution, “We have debunked the ‘baseless claims’ narrative promoted by the propaganda pushing media and are now on to the business of providing specific relief to the People.”\n\nFinchem acknowledges that there may not be an existing mechanism to “decertify” an election but argues that does not mean the state Legislature can’t create a remedy.

This historic moment when Arizona’s conspiracy crowd can rise, with one voice, and proclaim, “aHA!”\n\nYes, it seems that Arizona’s elusive election fraud has finally been uncovered.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party was jubilant at the news, delivered in Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s interim report on the findings of the Maricopa County election audit.\n\n“BREAKING NEWS: Arizona Audit w/ @KelliWardAZ. AG @GeneralBrnovich has determined widespread FRAUD in the Maricopa County 2020 election,” the Arizona Republican Party breathlessly reported.\n\nState GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward was practically orgasmic.\n\n“Perp walks & prosecutions on the way! #ElectionIntegrity,” she tweeted.\n\nWard even made a video about it (with a fundraising plea, no doubt, still to come).\n\n“The report says the Election Integrity Unit review has uncovered instances of election fraud,” Ward reported to the party faithful. “Yes, election fraud by individuals who have been or will be prosecuted for various election crimes... Wow. That’s big. The words fraud and prosecuted are finally being used.”\n\nWidespread election fraud = 9 cases in 3.4 million votes\n\nWow is right.\n\nEspecially if you read the footnote accompanying the 12-page report\'s lone sentence about election fraud – the one that references a report on all the fraud that Brnovich’s Elections Integrity Unit has uncovered in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAll nine cases.\n\nThere are the six felons who somehow allegedly managed to vote while in Pima County jail.\n\nAnd there are three women who returned their recently deceased mothers’ early ballots. Two of them live in Maricopa County, one in Cochise County.\n\nSo. Nine cases of election fraud. Out of 3.4 million votes cast.\n\nSomething’s widespread, all right, and rather fragrant, as well. But it isn’t fraud.\n\nWithin hours of Brnovich\'s report, Republican legislative hopeful Steve Zipperman had already pumped out a fundraising plea.\n\n""Attorney General Brnovich has released a letter to Senator Fann (click below for full text), declaring that there WAS “Election Fraud” in the 2020 election...,"" wrote Zipperman, one of three Republicans hoping to replace Sen. Karen Fann. ""As the ONLY Arizona Senate Candidate for LD-1 who declared that there WAS Election Fraud in 2020, Steve was attacked for his conviction. Steve’s insight, courage, and motivation to restore voter confidence in Arizona is essential.""\n\nNo word on Steve\'s ability to read a footnote.\n\nOr maybe he intentionally omitted the fact that we are talking about nine whole cases of election fraud.\n\nNot even Brnovich – the Senate candidate who is slipping in the polls and desperately chasing Donald Trump’s endorsement – could bring himself to claim Arizona\'s election was stolen, though he came as close as he possibly could. (Which is to say, not close at all).\n\nHe claimed there are “serious vulnerabilities” in Arizona’s electoral system, but he couldn’t point to a single instance of a phony vote as a result.\n\nThe only \'vulnerability\' is Brnovich\'s Senate campaign\n\nThe only truly serious vulnerability here is Brnovich’s Senate campaign prospects, which is why I suspect that the attorney general who in 2020 had no problem with Arizona’s election now suddenly ... does.\n\nIn November 2020, as politicians all around him were diving for cover, Brnovich went on national TV to proclaim that there was simply no evidence that Donald Trump was robbed in Arizona. Then he went on to certify the election.\n\n“It came down to: People split their ticket,” he told Fox Business’ Neil Cavuto. “People voted for Republicans down ballot, and they didn’t vote for President Trump or Martha McSally. So, that’s the reality.”\n\nAnd yet here is Brnovich now, when there still is no evidence that Donald Trump was robbed.\n\n“It is frustrating. It’s frustrating to all of us,"" he said on Steve Bannon\'s podcast on Thursday. ""Because I think we all know what happened in 2020,” he told Bannon. “I assure you Steve, I understand how serious this is. I understand why people are frustrated.”\n\nMore frustrating still is what is happening in 2022.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com.

The federal indictment of Trump said this was part of a criminal conspiracy aimed at keeping him in office.\n\nThe Michigan electors were each charged with eight felonies and released on $1,000 bonds.\n\nAt least eight of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been offered immunity.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes\' office has said Arizona\'s electors are under investigation. The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/politics/fauci-rand-paul-roger-marshall-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Fauci spars with GOP lawmakers during tense Omicron hearing', 'Snippet': 'The confrontations with Sens.

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website. And you see, ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says, ‘contribute here,’ you can do $5, $10, $20, $100,” he said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nFauci brought a similarly pointed tone to his exchange with Marshall after the Kansas Republican falsely accused him of withholding financial disclosure forms.\n\n“You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary,” a visibly frustrated Fauci told Marshall, calling his financial information “public knowledge” for nearly four decades. After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen.

Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fauci-says-sen-paul-s-attacks-kindle-crazies-who-have-n1287299', 'Headline': ""Fauci says Sen.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/08/correcting-misinformation-about-dr-fauci/', 'Headline': 'Correcting Misinformation About Dr. Fauci - FactCheck.org', 'Snippet': 'Posted on August 25, 2022.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department.

Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, have collected more than 8,000 documents, including emails and other communications, plus nearly 25 hours of witness testimony.\n\nTheir report details the January through March 2020 activities of Dr. Anthony Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins in encouraging an international team of prominent scientists to attempt to debunk the notion that the pandemic could have originated in a lab.\n\nThe Means\n\nFollowing a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call, Fauci and Collins “prompted” the scientists to act. According to the report:\n\nThrough its investigation, the select subcommittee has learned that Dr. Fauci and NIH exerted more influence over the conference call than previously disclosed. Further, by the end of the Feb. 1 conference call, Dr. Fauci had suggested the drafting of a paper regarding the potential of a lab leak to Dr. [Kristian] Andersen twice. This suggestion was what ‘prompted’ Dr. Andersen to draft ‘Proximal Origin.’\n\n“Proximal Origin” refers to “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” the paper that ultimately was published in a scientific journal.\n\nThe end of this exercise was not a disinterested scientific effort, but rather an elaborate scheme to create a preferred political narrative that would dominate public discussion of the novel coronavirus. The means was publication in a high-powered, peer-reviewed professional journal that would discredit the “lab leak” theory.\n\nEncouraged by Collins and Fauci, the authors submitted their initial draft to Nature, but the journal turned it down because the editors wanted a stronger dismissal of the lab leak theory. As Andersen testified to the subcommittee, “They thought that we came down too strongly on the side that the virus had been of possible lab origin.”\n\nSo, the authors revised their paper, adding language that the lab origin was implausible, and successfully submitted it to Nature Medicine, part of the Nature portfolio of journals. The finished product—titled “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2”—was published in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article, according to the subcommittee report, “is one of the single most impactful and influential scientific papers in history, and it expressed conclusions that were not based on sound science nor in fact, but instead on assumptions.”\n\nData Problem\n\nIn arguing for a natural or zoonotic (transferred from animals to humans) origin of the pandemic, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 had certain genetic features not found in previous coronaviruses was a problem, but an even greater difficulty was the absence of hard data. On Jan. 3, 2020, Communist Chinese authorities shut down the sharing of any COVID-19 data or information without government approval.\n\nAs noted in a Senate staff report sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.:\n\nScientists have not yet succeeded at tracing the origin because they have been denied access to the data that would facilitate a retrospective study of its genomic epidemiology. The epidemiological data released by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) appears to have been curated to create an informational maze that leads to perpetual puzzlement.\n\nTherefore, none of the scientists engaged by Fauci or Collins in February 2020 had, or could have had, access to any hard Chinese data on the novel coronavirus—especially information of an intermediate animal host—that could have proven, or at least strongly supported, the Chinese-endorsed narrative of the zoonotic or natural origin of the pandemic.\n\nSeveral potential candidates for the intermediate animal host, including pangolins and raccoon dogs, have been floated; but to this day, no such host has been identified.\n\nNumerous emails among the multiple authors during the Nature Medicine article’s drafting in February 2020 are especially revealing. Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University, for example, initially expressed the view that the virus could have been genetically manipulated in a lab. Based on a previous select subcommittee report, he was not alone among this group of virologists in his initial impressions.\n\nAccording to this week’s subcommittee report, Andersen, of Scripps Research Institute, who completed the initial draft, admitted in an email on Feb. 8, 2020:\n\nOur main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn’t conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered.\n\nIn a Feb. 11 email, Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University said the paper provided a “plausible argument against genetic engineering,” but it did not close the door on an “inadvertent release” of the virus from the Wuhan lab. It stated:\n\nGiven the scale of the bat Cov [a wide range of bat-borne coronaviruses] research pursued there and the site of its emergence of the first human cases, we have a nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess.\n\nThen again, on Feb. 20, Andersen—seemingly struggling with the task of refuting a lab origin conclusively—admitted in an email, “We all really, really wish we could do that (that’s how this got started), but unfortunately, it’s just not possible given the data.”\n\nSo, in the absence of scientific data, Andersen and his team proposed a theoretical construct of how SARS-CoV-2 emerged in nature.\n\nMotives\n\nFuture congressional inquiries into this controversy should, of course, focus on the motivation behind this extraordinary effort to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nBased on the email exchanges among the key participants, this little platoon seemed inordinately obsessed with maintaining good relations with Communist China. In a Feb. 2 email, Dr. Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh wrote:\n\nGiven the s— show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release, my feeling is we should say that given there is no evidence of a specifically engineered virus, we cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape, so we are content with ascribing it to natural process.\n\nScientists must keep their priorities in order, emphasized Dr. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist: “Further debate about such accusations [of a lab leak] would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular.”\n\nCollins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.”\n\nIn short, the email traffic follows the politics.\n\nConcerning Fauci, the subcommittee report simply recounts that he knew at the time, or should have known, that his agency had funded EcoHealth Alliance, a firm engaged in “dangerous experiments” with the Wuhan Institute of Virology; that these coronavirus research activities were conducted with “very little oversight”; that EcoHealth Alliance was not in compliance with the federal government’s grant requirements and failed to report on its work in a timely fashion; and that the Wuhan Institute’s biosafety levels were “substandard”—a fact recently confirmed by the director of national intelligence. Congressional investigators will surely need to probe Fauci’s memory of these matters.\n\nThough the hypothesis of a lab leak as the origin of a pandemic that has killed more than 1.1 million Americans is no longer dismissed today as a “conspiracy theory,” the damage to democratic discourse has been done.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article became the seminal scientific paper that drove the dominant narrative of COVID-19’s natural origins for the past three and half years. It also provided the strongest justification to marginalize alternative scientific opinion.\n\nThat corrosive impact on public discourse was itself a scandal. As New York Times columnist Bret Stephens observed: “The reasons for this—rank partisanship and credulous reporting—and the methods by which it was enforced—censorship and vilification—are reminders that sometimes the most destructive enemies of science can be those who claim to speak in its name.”\n\nEditor’s note: This article was updated on March 25, 2024, to correct the excerpt from Dr. Kristian Andersen’s email of Feb. 8, 2020.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs. Fauci and Collins, and instead of being on a mission to destroy two people, I wish we were on a mission to get the facts,” she said.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/2008029/nihs-new-boss-same-as-old-boss-on-wuhan-lab-and-gain-of-function-research/', 'Headline': 'NIH’s new boss same as old boss on Wuhan lab and gain-of-function research', 'Snippet': 'February 13, 2023 9:36 pm. .

Lawrence Tabak has been “performing the duties of NIH director” since Collins left, and he was grilled in front of the House last week, where he doubled down on the denials by Fauci, Collins, and the NIH about U.S. taxpayer funding ending up being used for gain-of-function research at the Chinese lab.\n\nThe NIH provided millions of dollars to Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance over the years, and Daszak maintained a long working relationship with Wuhan lab “bat lady” Shi Zhengli, sending her lab at least $600,000 in NIH funding. The NIH grants to EcoHealth included funding for Wuhan lab experiments on the bat viruses, which Republicans and some virology critics of Fauci have said were gain-of-function experiments aimed at making the viruses more transmissible or lethal, which the NIH has denied.\n\nThe NIH concluded that EcoHealth violated NIH guidelines when conducting bat coronavirus research while working with the Chinese government lab, but the NIH, Fauci, and Tabak insist that this still wasn’t gain-of-function research.\n\nRep.

They are genetically distinct. They are absolutely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2,” Tabak said of the Wuhan lab. “It would be equivalent to saying that a human is equivalent to a cow.”\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party-owned China Daily touted Tabak’s comments with the headline: “NIH head refutes COVID lab-leak rhetoric.”\n\nTRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL CALLS LACK OF COVID-19 ORIGINS INVESTIGATION ‘INEXCUSABLE’\n\nThe NIH announced in August it was finally cutting off a subaward through EcoHealth to the Wuhan Institute after the lab continued to refuse to hand over lab notebooks and electronic files about the coronavirus research it conducted with U.S. funds, but the NIH nevertheless gave EcoHealth further bat coronavirus funding the next month.\n\nThe NIH contends that it has specific rules for dealing with “enhanced potential pandemic pathogens” of concern.\n\n“How can you state, how can the NIH know for sure, that it hasn’t funded ePPP when NIH can’t be sure it can get the lab records of experiments funded by NIH?” Lesko asked Tabak.\n\nTabak replied, “As a result of them failing to provide us with the adequate documentation, they no longer have any funding from NIH.” Tabak also contended that the Wuhan lab’s “work was commensurate with the modest sums of money that we provided to them” but that “I don’t know what other work they are conducting there.”\n\nRep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) also asked how the NIH is implementing a legal provision banning gain-of-function research. Tabak replied that “there is no funding of ePPP research in any foreign country today that is sponsored by NIH.” He added that “there has not been in the past funded by NIH related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”\n\nRichard Ebright, the lab director for the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University who has long pointed to the possibility that COVID-19 emerged from the Wuhan lab and has argued Fauci and others are misleading about NIH-funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan, said that Tabak’s testimony was “untruthful” in at least four ways.\n\n“First, Tabak falsely stated that NIH is not currently supporting gain-of-function research or enhanced potential pandemic pathogens research,” Ebright told the Washington Examiner. “Second, Tabak falsely stated that NIH had not supported gain-of-function research or enhanced potential pandemic pathogens research in Wuhan. Third, Tabak falsely stated that the NIH grant to EcoHealth Alliance that supported high-risk research in Wuhan had received the risk-benefit review mandated under the HHS P3CO Framework.”\n\nEbright added, “Fourth, Tabak falsely stated that the NIH-supported high-risk research in Wuhan could not have resulted in SARS-CoV-2. Apropos the fourth of Tabak’s untruthful statements: The NIH has no information on identities and sequences of the SARS-like viruses constructed by EcoHealth Alliance and its Wuhan partners subsequent to their 2018 grant progress report and their 2018 grant renewal proposal. Therefore, the NIH cannot rule out the possibility that EcoHealth Alliance and its Wuhan partners created SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal progenitor, and cannot even rule out the possibility that EcoHealth and its Wuhan partners used NIH funding to create SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal progenitor.”\n\nSubcommittee on Health Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) said last week that the “NIH’s refusal to acknowledge any suggestion that the COVID-19 virus may have originated in a lab only continues to fuel the controversy and questions around it.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency rejected a $14.2 million proposal by EcoHealth in 2018 over concerns the bat virus experiments involved “gain-of-function” research.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/why-the-us-has-banned-funding-for-chinese-lab-at-center-of-pandemic-origin-dispute', 'Headline': 'Explainer: Why the U.S. has banned funding for Chinese lab at ... - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump alleged in April 2020 that SARS-CoV-2 came from WIV and directed NIH to cancel the grant to EcoHealth, which it did, triggering a controversy.

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system.\n\nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\n\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66983060', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists behind mRNA Covid vaccines - BBC', 'Snippet': 'EPA.

I'm chief data and AI officer at Moderna. mRNA is essentially an information molecule. It's encoded, a sequence of amino acids, which when they enter the cell in your body, it produces a protein and that protein can perform a variety of different functions in your body from curing a rare disease, potentially attacking cancer, or even a vaccine to battle of virus like we've seen with Covid.\n\nWhat's so fundamentally different about this approach from the typical pharmaceutical development is it's much more of a design approach. We're saying we know what we want to do. And then we're trying to design the right information molecule, the right protein, that will then have that effect in the body.\n\nAnd if you know anything about pharmaceutical development, it tends to be a very serial process. You know, you start with some kind of initial concept, some initial idea and you test it in Petri dishes or in, you know, small experiments. And then you move on to preclinical testing. And if all of that looks good, then you're finally moving off to, to human testing and you go through several different phases of clinical trials where phase three is the, the largest one where you're proving the efficacy of this drug.\n\nAnd that whole process from end to end can be immensely expensive, cost billions of dollars and take, you know, up to a decade to do that. And in many cases, it still fails. You know, there's countless diseases out there right now that have no vaccine for them, that have no treatment for them. And it's not like people haven't tried, it's just, they're, they're challenging.\n\nAnd so we built the company thinking about: how can we reduce those timelines? How can we target many, many more things? And so that's how I kind of entered into the company. You know, my background is in software engineering and data science. I actually have a PhD in what's called information physics—which is very closely related to data science.\n\nAnd I started when the company was really young, maybe a hundred, 200 people at the time. And we were building that early preclinical engine of a company, which is, how can we target a bunch of different ideas at once, run some experiments, learn really fast and do it again. Let's run a hundred experiments at once and let's learn quickly and then take that learning into the next stage.\n\nSo if you wanna run a lot of experiments, you have to have a lot of mRNA. So we built out this massively parallel robotic processing of mRNA, and we needed to integrate all of that. We needed systems to kind of drive all of those, uh, robotics together. And, you know, as things evolved as you capture data in these systems, that's where AI starts to show up. You know, instead of just capturing, you know, here's what happened in an experiment, now you're saying let's use that data to make some predictions.\n\nLet's take out decision making away from, you know, scientists who don't wanna just stare and look at data over and over and over again. But let's use their insights. Let's build models and algorithms to automate their analyses and, you know, do a much better job and much faster job of predicting outcomes and improving the quality of our, our data.\n\nSo when Covid showed up, it was really, uh, a powerful moment for us to take everything we had built and everything we had learned, and the research we had done and really apply it in this really important scenario. Um, and so when this sequence was first released by Chinese authorities, it was only 42 days for us to go from taking that sequence, identifying, you know, these are the mutations we wanna do. This is the protein we want to target.\n\nForty-two days from that point to actually building up clinical-grade, human safe manufacturing, batch, and shipping it off to the clinic—which is totally unprecedented. I think a lot of people were surprised by how fast it moved, but it's really… We spent 10 years getting to this point. We spent 10 years building this engine that lets us move research as quickly as possible. But it didn't stop there.\n\nWe thought, how can we use data science and AI to really inform the, the best way to get the best outcome of our clinical studies. And so one of the first big challenges we had was we have to do this large phase three trial to prove in a large number, you know, it was 30,000 subjects in this study to prove that this works, right?\n\nThat's a huge study. Covid had been flaring, um, infecting countless people. And we had to figure out: where do we run our studies? We're gonna pick a hundred locations in the US to run this study and we needed to balance finding places where we have kind of the right racial diversity that's the right makeup for the country.\n\nWe needed to balance… kind of practical concerns. If we need a, you know, the right size facility and clinical trial sites that can deliver quality data. And we need to find places where Covid has not already hit. So at the time New York, for example, was already heavily hit. And so it wouldn't be an ideal place to run a clinical study because we have to accrue cases of it.\n\nSo we had to find places that weren't quite yet hit, but places that we expected to actually, you know, surge, you know, maybe six weeks after the study started after people had been inoculated. So that's a really challenging problem we had to solve. And I wanna say, you know, we, we didn't do this all entirely internally.\n\nWe worked with countless external partners. And I can't tell you the number of different epidemiology models that we saw. It seemed like everybody was an epidemiologist all of a sudden. But we incorporated all that learning all that information into our internal decision making and used that to try to find: these are the optimal places that we should run this study.\n\nAnd then even while we were running this study, we were saying, how can we continue to optimize and do better? You know, we built real time analytics into our studies enrollment. So as patients or subjects enrolled into the study, were treated with our vaccine, we are monitoring the diversity of this: the age, the gender, and racial diversity to ensure that the final makeup of this study, when all said and done was representative of the US.\n\nWe got, I wanna say, maybe 80% of the way through the study. And we realized, look, we are not gonna meet our, our objectives because the level of volunteers aren't quite what we wanted. And so we made the, the really difficult decision to say, look, we need a throttle, some areas of the country and focus on outreach in different areas to get the right makeup so that the study was representative.\n\nAll told, it was about a year from when we, you know, started this journey on Covid to when we got the emergency use authorization for the vaccine—which again is really unprecedented for something that usually takes many years. And I'll say for myself personally, it was just such an amazing kind of emotional moment of, you know, I joined the company almost eight years earlier, not thinking necessarily I would ever use one of our own medicines because we weren't even doing vaccines at the time. But to have that injected in my arm and for my family to get it for my friends and everyone else to, to see that benefit and for so many other people in the world, was just an amazing moment for us.\n\nJennifer Strong: I Was There When... features stories from people who witnessed or created breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and computing.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-02/kariko-weissman-mrna-covid-vaccine-nobel-prize', 'Headline': 'Scientists whose work paved way for COVID vaccines win Nobel - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists whose work on mRNA paved the way for first COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel Prize.

Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6319654/nobel-prize-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers/', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize Awarded to Work Behind COVID-19 Vaccine | TIME', 'Snippet': 'Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including ...', 'Full_text': 'It was an unlikely collaboration, and it began in an unlikely place, but the partnership that Katalin Kariko and Dr. Drew Weissman formed in the 1990s at the University of Pennsylvania has now led to a shared Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.\n\nKariko and Weissman were awarded the Nobel for their work in tweaking the genetic material mRNA to make it more amenable to working in vaccines. Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

The first awards were given out in 1901.\n\nKey development in 2005\n\nKariko was senior vice-president and head of RNA protein replacement at BioNTech until 2022 and has since acted as an adviser to the company. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nWeissman is professor in vaccine research at the Perelman School.\n\nThe two have said they met and began chatting in 1998 while waiting for rationed photocopying machine time.\n\n""Maybe you have some more copy machines now,"" Kariko said at UPenn on Monday. ""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday. The economics prize is announced on Oct. 9.\n\nWinners of this year\'s Nobel Prizes will get an extra 1 million crowns compared to last year, partly because the Swedish crown has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the euro the past decade.

Key are the following events (Fig. 1):\n\nIn 1987, a graduate student at the Salk Institute named Robert Malone mixed mRNA with fat droplets and showed that human cells incubated therein started translating the mRNA and producing proteins4. His results suggested that one day mRNA could be used as a drug.\n\nIn 2000, Ingmar Hoerr of Tübingen University injected mRNA in mice and was able to elicit immune responses caused by the translated proteins5. Hoerr later founded the mRNA company CureVac.\n\nIn 2005, Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania showed that mRNA containing pseudouridine (Ψ) had improved translational capacities, increased biological stability and decreased stimulation of innate immunity caused by uridine6. A variant thereof, 1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) was later developed by Jason Schrum (but already anticipated in Karikó and Weissman’s respective patent US8278036), and is said to exhibit even better protein expression rates and further reduced immunogenicity. Today, m1Ψ is used in Moderna and BioNTech’s COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In contrast, CureVac uses a G+C-enriched open reading frame with a similar goal, namely to reduce the uridine content of the mRNA.\n\nIn 2014, Pieter Cullis, who later founded the lipid company Acuitas, and co-workers developed the four-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) comprising, among other things, a PEGylated lipid and an ionizable lipid that is able to associate with the negatively charged mRNA7. These LNPs are used in all mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines currently on the market.\n\nAnd in 2016, Moderna began the first clinical trial with an LNP plus mRNA–based vaccine8. As a result of these advances, mRNA vaccine technology was fit for purpose when SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier in late 2019. Or, as BioNTech’s founders Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin recount: “If the pandemic hit a year earlier, we might not have been in the position to respond this fast.”9\n\nCoronaviridae have accompanied mankind for thousands of years as part of the annual viral winter cocktail, typically causing minor symptoms of a common cold. The virus family came into the spotlight as a consequence of the SARS-CoV and MERS epidemics. Though many research groups started to develop vaccines, these efforts were arrested when the two diseases suddenly disappeared. However, the respective research provided valuable insights that then helped to accelerate the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn 2017, scientists at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dartmouth College and Scripps Research Institute led by Barney Graham looked at the MERS-CoV spike protein and found out that, when the spike protein binds to the ACE-2 receptor on a target cell, the two helices and the loop of the spike protein change from their prefusion configuration into one long helix that engages with the target cell, thus allowing the fusion of virus and cell10. The researchers realized that blocking that configuration shift could prevent viral fusion, hence extending the time within which the protein, when used as a vaccine, is antigenic and causes immune reactions.\n\nThe researchers came up with a mutant MERS-CoV spike protein that comprises two consecutive proline substitutions (the 2P mutation). These substitutions are placed at a junction between heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and the central helix, so as to maintain the spike protein in a prefusion conformation. The group applied this approach to different coronaviruses that were known at that time — including SARS, where the two substitutions are K968P and V969P — and filed a patent application on 25 October 2016 (US2020061185A1 and family members). The disclosure of this patent family is not restricted to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike protein mutants, but also includes spike mutants of quite a few other Coronaviridae (Table 1). The motif within which the proline substitutions have been accomplished is well conserved within the spike protein (Table 1). Fig. 2 shows a sequence logo of the sequence motifs from Table 1, with positions 5 and 6 the ones to be substituted by proline, to illustrate the relative abundance of key amino acids in that motif.\n\nThe NIH were granted patents in the United States and Europe, among other venues, with claims related to a recombinant coronavirus protein comprising one or two proline substitutions near the junction between HR1 and the central helix. Hence, even though the underlying application was filed before SARS-CoV-2 entered the stage, the claims encompass as well a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having the 2P mutation in that region.\n\nIn late December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China. It became clear that a new virus was responsible for these new infections, which was soon identified to be a coronavirus — first called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) before virologists settled on the name SARS-CoV-2. On 12 January 2020, Chinese researchers led by Yong-Zhen Zhang of Fudan University uploaded the SARS-CoV-2 genome to GenBank (NCBI reference sequence NC_045512.2)11.\n\nThe genome has a length of 29,903 nucleotides and encodes in reading frame rf 2/direct the 1,273 amino acid peptide sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The translated amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was uploaded to UniProt on 22 February 2020 (UniProt identifier P0DTC2).\n\nThe sequences of the SARS-CoV spike protein (UniProt identifier P59594) and that of SARS-CoV-2 turned out to be highly similar (identity 76.4%). In particular, both proteins share the sequence SRLDKVEA at the motif mentioned above — in fact, they have a stretch of 111 identical amino acids in common that surrounds the motif.\n\nThe arrival of the new virus did not remain unnoticed in the mRNA vaccine community. Reportedly, Stéphane Bancel of Moderna, who had already worked with the NIH for four years on the development of antiviral mRNA vaccines, contacted Barney Graham on 6 January 2020 (that is, after the first news of the viral outbreak in China came up, but before the genome was published), and Graham told him: “If it’s a coronavirus, we know what to do.”12\n\nBioNTech’s Şahin recounts returning from his family’s Friday ritual of dinner at a Vietnamese restaurant on 24 January 2020 and checking the latest scientific literature, learning about the rapidly spreading virus in China. By Sunday, he and his team had the respective sequences available, and on Monday, back in the office, they decided to set up vaccine development9.\n\nSoon after Moderna and BioNTech, CureVac also started to develop an mRNA vaccine. A patent search in the database PatentLens using the 1,273 amino acid spike protein, plus the substitutions K986P and V987P (the latter derived by analogy from the corresponding 2P mutant of the SARS-CoV spike protein as disclosed by the NIH group), revealed that within weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, several entities filed patent applications disclosing or claiming said SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 2P mutant. Obviously, all applicants — like the author of this article— had gone through the same exercise of combining the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the findings of the NIH group.\n\nUS company Novavax, which is developing the NVX-CoV2373 spike protein vaccine, was the first to receive a receipt stamp from the patent office, securing a filing date of 27 January 2020 — a mere 15 days after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was published. Moderna filed 1 day later. Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) followed on 31 January 2020, CureVac on 4 February 2020, the NIH on 11 February 2020, and others followed, including BioNTech on 22 April 2020 — all of them claiming an identical 2P mutant protein, or mRNA encoding said same protein (Fig. 3).\n\nNone of these early applications comprise experimental data with regard to the claimed vaccine — which is unsurprising, considering the time available for drafting. Moderna’s priority application, for instance, comprises mere prophetic examples (example 1: “the instant study is designed to test the immunogenicity of the candidate coronavirus vaccines,” “animals are vaccinated,” “formulation may include PEG-modified lipid”; example 2: “the instant study is designed to test the efficacy of candidate coronavirus vaccines,” “animals are vaccinated,” “animals are then challenged with –1 LD90 of coronavirus”), yet no wet-lab results are provided. (Note that in patent literature, the use of the present tense suggests that an experiment was not actually performed, but just hypothesized.)\n\nRemarkably, the overlaps between the different patent filings are not restricted to the sequence of the encoding mRNA or the spike protein, respectively. Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech’s mRNA vaccines have even more similarities, which are reflected in their patent claims. Table 2 shows a synopsis of their respective international patent applications, with the sequence identifier of the 1,273 amino acid SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the 2P mutant, and the claim number and language that refers to similar or identical elements reproduced in abbreviated form. All three applications claim the same sterol and the same conventional lipid, while CureVac and BioNTech also claim the same PEGylated lipid and ionizable lipid. Moderna and BioNTech also claim the use of m1Ψ, while CureVac optionally excludes said variant and prefers G+C enrichment instead (which BioNTech only suggests as an option). In such a situation, where several entities file — almost simultaneously — patents related to essentially the same subject matter, this may inevitably lead to legal conflicts, as we have witnessed in the ongoing CRISPR–Cas9 patent dispute13.\n\nHowever, the mRNA vaccine patents may not necessarily follow the same road. All three applications are still in what is called the 18-months long ‘international phase’ (with one exception for Moderna, described below), and are hence not yet pending in the different destination countries. For all three applications, International Search Reports (ISR) have been issued (prepared by the European Patent Office (EPO) as the International Searching Authority), which come with a preliminary opinion on patentability. In all three cases, the respective examiners came to the conclusion that the claimed subject matter would not be novel or not rely on an inventive step. In all cases, the examiners referred to the prepublished SARS-CoV-2 genome and publications anticipating the 2P mutation in the spike protein of other coronaviruses14,15,16. In the national patent phases, which come after the international phase, most national patent offices rely on (though are not bound to) the opinion of the International Searching Authority. This means that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech, should they decide to enter the national phases with their cases, will experience considerable headwinds.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, Moderna already has a pending US patent application (US20210228707A1) that received a Notice of Allowance on 27 August 2021. However, on 14 December 2021, the US Patent & Trademark Office delivered an abandonment notice, according to which Moderna failed to pay the issue fee and the publication fee. The application is therefore deemed abandoned. The reason for this step may lie in a smoldering dispute between Moderna and the NIH, who claimed that its inventors have not received credit in Moderna’s patent application. Moderna, who before had contested the claim, has backed down and explained on 17 December 2021 that it was in talks with the NIH and payment of the issue fee would be a counterproductive signal17. However, to maintain all options, Moderna has filed a continuation application (17/518,542), which is not yet published. In any case, the patent claims as granted, while protecting vaccines that comprise mRNAs encoding the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type spike protein with the 2P mutation included, do not encompass vaccines that comprise only mRNAs for mutated variants. Note, for example, that the Omicron variant has more than 35 mutations in the 1,273 amino acid spike protein, resulting in a sequence identity of only 96.8% with the wild-type protein18.\n\nIn view of the prior art situation, patent claims from the above discussed patent estates, if granted at all, would likely be restricted to the exact SARS-CoV-2 wild-type spike protein with the 2P mutation — which is what happened to Moderna’s US patent application. Broader patent claims, wherein the scope is widened by using a homology range of, say, 80%, would bear the risk of also encompassing prior art spike proteins — for example, from the NIH patent publication.\n\nFor updated vaccines that mRNA companies are developing19, such narrow claims are worthless, at least if the updated vaccine is monovalent or does not comprise the wild-type-derived protein. This, combined with the unfavorable findings in the ISRs, could discourage the applicants from further pursuing their respective patent applications, which could result in the unprecedented situation that some of the most successful (and commercially valuable) drugs in history remain without enforceable patent protection, hence dissipating concerns that patents could be the reason for inequitable access to COVID-19 vaccines2.'}}",99.16666666666667,1

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://iea.org.uk/publications/did-lockdowns-work-the-verdict-on-covid-restrictions/', 'Headline': 'Did lockdowns work?

We define lockdowns as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardised measures for inclusion in the metaanalysis.\n\nThey are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2 per cent. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0 per cent. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7 per cent. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had a negligible effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Herby-Jonung-Hanke meta-analysis found that lockdowns, as reported in studies based on stringency indices in the spring of 2020, reduced mortality by 3.2 per cent when compared to less strict lockdown policies adopted by the likes of Sweden\n\nThis means lockdowns prevented 1,700 deaths in England and Wales, 6,000 deaths across Europe, and 4,000 deaths in the United States.\n\nLockdowns prevented relatively few deaths compared to a typical flu season – in England and Wales, 18,500–24,800 flu deaths occur, in Europe 72,000 flu deaths occur, and in the United States 38,000 flu deaths occur in a typical flu season\n\nThese results pale in comparison to the Imperial College of London’s modelling exercises (March 2020), which predicted that lockdowns would save over 400,000 lives in the United Kingdom and over 2 million lives in the United States\n\nHerby, Jonung, and Hanke conclude that voluntary changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, played a significant role in mitigating the pandemic – but harsher restrictions, like stay-at-home rules and school closures, generated very high costs but produced only negligible health benefits\n\nCOVID-19 lockdowns were “a global policy failure of gigantic proportions,” according to this peer-reviewed new academic study. The draconian policy failed to significantly reduce deaths while imposing substantial social, cultural, and economic costs.\n\nThe comprehensive 220-page book, began with a systematic review of 19,646 potentially relevant studies. For their meta-analysis, the authors’ screening resulted in the choice of 22 studies that are based on actual, measured mortality data, not on results derived from modelling exercises. A meta-analysis is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for evidence, as it combines comparable, independent studies to determine overall trends.\n\nThe authors, including Professor Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University, also consider a range of studies that determined the impact of individual lockdown restrictions, including stay at-home rules to school closures and travel restrictions.\n\nIn each case, the restrictions did little to reduce COVID-19 mortality:\n\nShelter-in-place (stay at home) orders in Europe and the United States reduced COVID mortality by between 1.4 and 4.1 per cent;\n\nBusiness closures reduced mortality by 7.5 per cent;\n\nGathering limits likely increased COVID mortality by almost six per cent;\n\nMask mandates, which most countries avoided in Spring 2020, reduced mortality by 18.7 per cent, particularly mandates in workplaces; and\n\nSchool closures resulted in a between 2.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent mortality reduction.\n\nA second approach employed by the authors to estimate the effects of lockdowns on mortality combined studies that looked at specific lockdown measures (such as school closures, mask wearing, etc.) on how single non-pharmaceutical interventions were actually used in Europe and the United States. Using this approach, the authors estimate that lockdowns reduced mortality by 10.7 per cent in the spring of 2020 – significantly less than estimates produced by epidemiological modelling.\n\nThe study compares the effect of lockdown measures against the effect of ‘doing the least,’ rather than doing nothing at all. Sweden’s response to COVID was among the least stringent in Europe, but still imposed some legal restrictions and included an extensive public information campaign.\n\nYou can read the press release for the book here.\n\nFullscreen Mode'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/22/facebook-posts/fauci-didnt-say-lockdowns-are-useful-forcing-vacci/', 'Headline': ""Fauci's comment about lockdowns, vaccination twisted out of context"", 'Snippet': 'Our ruling.

At the 6:54 mark in the video, Mitchell asked, ""How concerning is the outbreak in China?"" and mentioned the ongoing, near-total lockdown in Shanghai.\n\nPart of Fauci’s reply was, ""You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won\'t have a surge of infections, because you\'re dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they\'ve not really been exposed because of the lockdown.""\n\nHe went on to say, around the 8:25 mark, that people in China are not well-protected by vaccines — in part because China is using less effective vaccines than many other countries — and that its most vulnerable population, older people, are not vaccinated.\n\nHis observations about vaccinations in China are borne out by recent reporting.\n\nChina ""is struggling with two problems as it faces its worst COVID-19 surge since the start of the pandemic,"" according to an April 20 story in the Financial Times.

Civil liberties at their most basic are personal freedoms and the ability to avoid governmental intrusion on those freedoms. Mandates put restraints on those civil liberties. The question then becomes what is a restraint that is acceptable and what is a restraint that is unacceptable. Examples of mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic deemed legally acceptable include lockdowns, mask requirements under certain conditions, and shutdowns of venues.\n\nThe reasons for such measures, which legal scholars would refer to as a restraint or restriction on individuals’ civil liberties, are grounded in the responsibility of the government to protect those same individuals who believe their civil liberties are being restricted, and society as a whole, from harm, in this case, COVID-19.\n\nAccording to research by Xiaoshuang Liu et. al., in the article “Differential impact of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions on COVID-19 epidemics in the United States,” interventions such as mask mandates, gathering bans, and non-essential business closures, while having a restriction on civil liberties, safeguarded the public and their health. The study looked at nine different interventions in terms of their capacity to control COVID-19. Stay at home orders were the most effective at controlling COVID-19. Restricting gathering sizes, closing non-essential businesses, and face masks were also found by the study researchers to be effective in reducing COVID-19 rates. The researchers concluded that such restrictions “played critical roles on epidemic control in the U.S. in the past several months.”\n\nOne of the most important legal cases regarding public health and civil liberties is Jacobson v. Massachusetts 197, U.S. 11 (1905). On July 17, 1902, the board of health of Cambridge, Massachusetts set a deadline for all individuals residing in the city to either be vaccinated or re-vaccinated for the disease of smallpox. Those who did not comply were sentenced to pay a fine of $5. The plaintiff in the case, Henning Jacobson, refused to get vaccinated and was forced to pay a $5 fine. The court in the Jacobson case focused on several issues, including the role of the government at the local level to safeguard the public, and requirements that the government can put on individuals to keep everyone safe, but what we have not seen is forced vaccinations of individuals by the government.\n\nAccording to the Jacobson court, “the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.”\n\nIn fact, government mandates around public health are deeply rooted in American history. Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F. 3d 538 (2015) upheld a law requiring that all children going to school in the City of New York are required to be vaccinated in order to attend public school unless they meet a religious exemption. \u200b\u200bThe plaintiffs in the case argued that New York’s requirement that all children be vaccinated in order to attend public school was unconstitutional. Under the New York Public Health Law section 2164(7)(a) “[n]o principal, teacher, owner or person in charge of a school shall permit any child to be admitted to such school, or to attend such school, in excess of fourteen days” without evidence that the child has been immunized. The court in the case concluded that the New York Public Health Law was constitutional, the statute permissible, and the safeguards of protecting the public an important state interest.\n\nUltimately, while mandates can be a tool in ensuring compliance with necessary public health measures, according to researcher and author Anudeep Pant in an interview with the AmNews, “[t]here are several ways to combat vaccine hesitancy. Since we know some of the measures of vaccine hesitancy, these data points should be utilized to develop pointed interventions. For example, public health officials can get ahead of false narratives by monitoring misinformation that is circulating in their communities and developing education campaigns tailored to fill knowledge gaps and clarify misconceptions. Since different communities will have different reasons for refusing vaccination, specialized public health campaigns are key, this is no one-size-fits-all solution.”\n\n“Lastly, partnerships between local trusted leaders, faith-based leaders, local politicians, healthcare workers, social workers, culture bearers, scientists…can be a powerful tool when everyone is working toward the same goal. The background and expertise of each stakeholder will be diverse so complementary knowledge, skills, and experience can create grassroots movements that can be critical in tipping the scale,” he added.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2022-02-02/a-johns-hopkins-study-says-ill-founded-lockdowns-did-little-to-limit-covid-deaths', 'Headline': ""A Johns Hopkins study says 'ill-founded' COVID lockdowns did more harm ..."", 'Snippet': 'Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that lockdowns have done little to reduce COVID deaths but have had “devastating effects” on economies and numerous social ills.

Changing guidelines impact people’s daily lives. But the claims ignore the realities and challenges presented by a global pandemic caused by an emerging virus, researchers and science experts told us.\n\nScientists and doctors are worn down by the narrative.\n\n""These kinds of charges are frustrating,"" said Sarah Richardson, a science historian at Harvard University. ""They reflect a misunderstanding of how science works, how public health policy is created, and how empirical science and public health policy relate to one another.""\n\nScientific findings are often confusing and conflicting. But evolving research and changing guidelines aren’t unprecedented or shocking, nor are they indicative of something nefarious.\n\n""I can hardly blame people for feeling confused, but the problem is how this has been used politically,"" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. ""I think there has been a deliberate effort to take advantage of that kind of confusion by accusing people of purposely misleading the public and there is no way that that has been happening — it’s not reality.""\n\nHow COVID-19 impacted science\n\nMarilyn Mar, right, and Nai-Hua Jeng analyze samples from suspected COVID-19 patients at the Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory on Feb. 3, 2021, in Palo Alto, Calif. Scientists analyze samples for genetic changes, watching for mutations. (AP)\n\nScience is hard. COVID-19 made it harder. One reason is simply the unusually lengthy timeline of this pandemic.\n\nMost traditional epidemics run though communities over intervals of several months, said Dr. David Jones, an epidemiology professor at Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health and professor of the culture of medicine at the university’s history of science department.\n\n""Too short of a time for researchers to launch and analyze studies that could have changed their thinking,"" he said.\n\nThe scientific process takes time. It involves a series of observations and hypotheses that are followed up with tests and experiments that are tweaked and fine-tuned along the way. Heading into three years of COVID-19, it’s to be expected that scientific consensus — when it can be achieved — would change. When you add in a rapidly-evolving virus like SARS-CoV-2 which has impacted vaccine efficacy and the need for boosters, things get more complicated.\n\n""Someone has an observation, they do a study to test it, they learn something about it. And, as we learn more over time, we find out nuances,"" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director at the American Public Health Association. ""With COVID-19, we didn\'t have a static physical or biological object. It has been changing rapidly and we are altering the research along with it. The facts of the science haven\'t changed, the experiments and the virus have.""\n\nAs scientists did their work, thousands were dying every day. Public health officials still had to give guidance with the goal of trying to keep as many people as safe as possible.\n\nThere were so many mysteries to solve when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. No. 1: How was it transmitted? At first, many scientists believed, wrongly in hindsight, that it would behave similarly to SARS, a coronavirus that caused an outbreak in 2003. That virus, formally called SARS-CoV-1, caused an outbreak that lasted a short period. This is due, in part, to the fact that asymptomatic people could not spread it.\n\nWith its asymptomatic spread, COVID-19 turned out to be to SARS what a fox is to a dog, Goldman said: ""They\'re both canines, but they’re very different animals.""\n\nThere was no handbook for this new virus.\n\n""Even just logically giving advice on how other members of the very same family of coronaviruses — a lot of that didn’t work,"" Goldman said. ""Controlling those viruses is completely different from controlling COVID. But I think people tried very hard to do everything they could to save lives.""\n\nAmong pandemics in history, COVID-19 stands alone. But experts said the 1918 influenza pandemic provides a good example of how scientific understanding develops in such a crisis.\n\nThe 1918 pandemic had three main waves spanning one to two years. Scientists kept trying to identify its cause. At the time, they believed that a number of bacteria were responsible for the outbreak, only to discover years later in the 1930s that the cause was a virus.\n\nBut the scientists who had incorrectly proposed a bacterial origin weren’t ""lying,"" experts said. They were doing hard science in a crisis setting with inadequate tools, which can lead to wrong answers.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge the role that interest groups play in challenging what are sometimes unpopular scientific findings. There is a long history, going back to tobacco in the 1950s or climate change in the 1980s, where interest groups highlighted the imperfections of the scientific process in order to advance their own interests.\n\nScience is easy to critique as studies vary in terms of scale and robustness, Jones said. If science is used to regulate interests that profit from lack of regulation, it makes sense that those groups would characterize the scientists as liars.\n\n""Messaging from the CDC and NIH has left a lot to be desired, and political interests shape it, but that doesn’t mean that Fauci was ‘lying,’"" Jones said.\n\nConfusion over masks\n\nKindergarten teacher Karen Drolet, left, works with a student at Raices Dual Language Academy, a public school in Central Falls, R.I., Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022. (AP)\n\nMask-wearing quickly became one of the most volatile aspects of the pandemic. Answers to questions about which masks to wear, where to wear them and who should wear them have fluctuated with time and understanding.\n\nBefore COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, Fauci advised the general public against wearing masks. This was due to initial confusion about how COVID-19 was transmitted and concerns about mask shortages for essential workers. When it became clear that there wouldn’t be a shortage and that public mask-wearing, along with social distancing, could greatly reduce transmission, recommendations changed.\n\nScientists still believe that masks are effective at preventing illness — that hasn’t changed. But public health guidance around masks has. That’s because scientific understanding has changed about what types of masks are most effective in the face of different COVID-19 variants and in different settings. Once used widely outside, masks are now known to be most useful indoors and in crowded spaces, where risk of transmission is far higher.\n\n""The first message of no masks was absolutely wrong, because (not wearing a) mask completely exposes you. Cloth masks that are multi-layered offer better protection, but the best is a well-fitting N95 mask,"" Benjamin said. ""But it’s a spectrum of protections, and we really need to talk about this in terms of risk and degrees of protection.""\n\nAlso at play in masking recommendations: rises and falls in infection rates and an upward trend in vaccination rates. With the CDC poised in late February to again revise its masking guidelines amid dropping COVID-19 infections, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said it makes sense to think about masks as we think about raincoats.\n\n""You wear it when it\'s raining,"" he said in a Feb. 23 interview with NPR. ""You take it off when it stops raining. And if we think of masks in that way, then yeah, during surges, we should have masks, and everybody should be wearing them. And when the surge ends, we should take off our masks.""\n\nMasks have also been hard to study, experts said\n\nMasking can be ""highly context-specific,"" Harvard’s Richardson said: ""Are other people masking? Are they vaccinated and boosted? What kinds of masks? What is the level of transmission in the community? Are they mandated? Are other mitigation policies in place?""\n\nThe question gets more complicated when it’s about masking in schools.\n\n""Do mask mandates in elementary schools help? I suspect you could find scientific articles that have drawn different conclusions from their data,"" Jones said. ""This is in part because good science is hard to do — some studies might be methodologically better than others and therefore closer to the ‘right answer’ — in part because contexts matter. Was the study done in warm or cold weather? Were the students indoors for eight hours at a stretch, or for less time? etc. Will a clear answer ever emerge? I’m really not sure.""\n\nThese uncertainties are essential to the scientific process, but are like firewood for skeptics.\n\nThen there’s political pressure. As public sentiment about the pandemic shifts, we’ve seen a number of Democratic lawmakers take action to lift mask mandates and ease other restrictions.\n\nWhile politics most certainly plays a role in some of these decisions, criticism of those actions fails to recognize that the landscape looks different now than it did when these rules were put in place. Among the many new factors are vaccines, case declines, optimism over news of milder variants, and mounting public concern about mental health struggles.\n\n""Creating public health policy requires uniting a wide range of constituencies around a shared platform, weighing costs and benefits,"" Richardson said. ""This is a slow-moving process, embedded in our democratic systems of governance, with its own constraints and inertias.""\n\nPublic messaging errors\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021. (AP)\n\nPublic health officials have attempted to alter their messaging in response to the science, but the end result hasn’t always been very effective or clear.\n\n""If we could go back, I think people would have given a lot more caution in their responses,"" Benjamin said. ""I think we would\'ve seen officials say, ‘This is what we know today, but it may be different later.’ There would be a lot more humility and detailed explanations about why things change.""\n\nIt’s all had an impact on how Americans view science. A Pew Research Center survey published Feb. 15 found 29% of U.S. adults said they have a great deal of confidence in medical scientists to act in the best interests of the public, down from 40% in November 2020.\n\nAnd a 2021 study by sociologists at the University of New Hampshire found that 31% of Americans surveyed said they believe scientists ""adjust their findings to get the answer they want."" Another 16% weren’t sure.\n\nWhat seems to be behind that belief, according to the sociologists? A ""misunderstanding of scientific methods, uncertainty, and the incremental nature of scientific inquiry.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/opinions/covid-19-pandemic-lockdowns-sepkowitz/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: No, Covid-19 lockdowns were not a mistake | CNN', 'Snippet': 'Responding to an excerpt from the book “The Big Fail,” which points to what the authors deem public health missteps during the Covid-19 pandemic — most notably lockdowns — Kent Sepkowitz ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Kent Sepkowitz is a physician and infectious disease expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nAs the clear and present danger of the Covid-19 pandemic begins to fade, discussions and judgments have been swirling as to whether the various battlefield public health decisions to confront the crisis were effective.\n\nEarlier this year, an analysis of the efficacy of wearing a mask caused such an uproar that the estimable Cochrane Review issued a very unusual statement to clarify just what the article said (the study limitations were too great to conclude much) and didn’t say (masks don’t work, full stop).\n\nMore recently, a British government inquiry into the country’s day-to-day pandemic management has suggested that decisions (“over-confidence and lack of planning”) and attitude (“misogyny and lack of humanity in the government’s response”) were sorely lacking.\n\nAnd now, business reporters Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera have published a book, “The Big Fail,” excerpted in a New York Magazine article headlined: “Covid Lockdowns were a Giant Experiment. It was a Failure.” (Full disclosure: I have read only the magazine excerpt, not the full book.) Given this provocative title, it is unsurprising to find a withering assessment of the lockdowns used in the US and many other countries as a means to control Covid-19.\n\nThe authors make some good points: The lockdown dislocated students from schools and customers from places of business. Medical care was delayed for some (though needed surgeries continued when hospital beds were available). And, most dramatically, young students lost the educational and social advantage of a physical classroom. (As for the students, by some accounts, the academic impact seems to have been transient.)\n\nThey summarize the issue this way: “Did the many social, economic, and medical downsides make [lockdowns], in the aggregate, not worth whatever short-term benefits they might yield?” Their answer is a loud “no.”\n\nTo which I, having read the same dozens of primary articles they did, say: You bet it was worth it.\n\nYes, lockdown was a blunt instrument that caused a great deal of collateral damage. The difference between my view and theirs, I think, is that they consider the lockdown a single activity stretched across the entire pandemic; in contrast, I would distinguish the initial lockdown, which was crucial, from the off-and-on lockdowns as therapies, vaccines and overall care improved. There is an argument to be made that these were not anywhere near as effective.\n\nIn other words, I consider the “short-term benefits” to be absolutely critical in allowing the medical world to steady itself and gain a much firmer grasp of the task at hand. One only had to work in health care in New York City to see the difference between early 2020, when the explosion of cases overwhelmed the city, versus later in 2020 when an effective therapy had been identified, supplies and diagnostic testing had been greatly improved (though still completely inadequate) and the makeshift ICUs and emergency rooms had been set in place.\n\nIt was still a nightmare to be sure, but it was a vastly more organized nightmare.\n\nThe “short-term benefits” at the start of the pandemic are simple to characterize: Every infection that was delayed due to the lockdowns was a day to the good, a day closer to the release of the mRNA vaccines in December 2020, a less-hectic day for the health care workers, a day for clinical trials to mature. Therefore, the authors’ statement that lockdowns “were a mistake that should not be repeated” because they had no “purpose other than keeping hospitals from being overrun in the short-term” is to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the day-to-day work that was being done.\n\nMost disturbing to me about this assessment and the others that have come along are the minimal mention of the death and debility the infection caused. A reminder for those who have forgotten just how brutal the pandemic was: Worldwide there have been 7 million deaths. In the US, there have been more than a million deaths, millions have some post-infection debility and many health care workers remain profoundly demoralized.\n\nIn this context, many of the outcomes of concern listed by Nocera and McLean — suicidal thoughts in teens, alcoholism and drug use increases, violence — are as easily explained by this staggering death toll as by the cabin fever brought on by lockdowns. Once again: About 1 out of every 350 Americans died in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother way to consider the impact of so many deaths is examination of life expectancy. Of note, life expectancy in the US fell in 2020 (1.8 years) and 2021 (0.6 years), the sharpest drop since the 1920s; per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 74% of the drop was attributed to Covid-19. This perspective makes a simple point for those who consider many deaths among the elderly and very elderly as sad but without larger societal implications. From the society perspective, if only the old and very old die, there should be little if any impact on life expectancy. To fall more than two years so precipitously requires the deaths of many in their 30s and 40s and 50s, as occurred with the first year of the pandemic.\n\nDespite endless studies, the debate about lockdowns will continue. The data is not clean. Real data — not prissy data from a generic randomized placebo controlled double-blind trial run by a pharma company with deep pockets (albeit with a desired outcome as well) — is never clean. Therefore, in its uncertainty there is room for all sorts of interpretations, crazy and not, and the issue will not be settled, though I agree that we must try.\n\nI do think that a practical conclusion that we may send to those caught up in a future pandemic of respiratory virus is this: Lock down hard and quickly until you and the world can get your bearings. Maintaining a functional health care system is crucial.\n\nThis of course shifts the hard debate to follow-up decisions. Once started, how quickly can one lift a lockdown? For me, this is the very unclear and very difficult problem and one that can frustrate an already overwhelmed public. The back and forth of the lockdown edicts seemed like more governmental dithering to many and requires a great deal of focused consideration.\n\nBut one large caveat to making the decisions that lie ahead: Historians — the tweedy tenured types — understand they stand at a safe remove from the events they are recounting. They acknowledge that being in the middle of total chaos is very different than writing about those who were in the middle of total chaos. The eminent historian Bernard Bailyn warned against the distortion this can impose: “The fact — the inescapable fact — is that we [historians] know how it all came out…and they [those involved in the events] did not.”\n\nTrue, those of us now giving our own analyses on the effectiveness of lockdowns lived through the pandemic. But still, we should consider context of the Covid reality that we are now somewhat removed from in our assessments. We now know that Covid-19 faded slowly in 2023; the public health experts in the center of the crisis did not. They followed what little science was available and made their best judgments. So let’s perhaps follow the decent path and evaluate but not castigate as we together try to understand just what happened.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://iea.org.uk/media/lockdowns-were-a-costly-failure-finds-new-iea-book/', 'Headline': 'Lockdowns were a costly failure, finds new IEA book', 'Snippet': 'A new systematic review and meta-analysis published by the Institute of Economic Affairs finds that Covid lockdowns failed to significantly reduce deaths.

The draconian policy failed to significantly reduce deaths while imposing substantial social, cultural, and economic costs.\n\n“This study is the first all-encompassing evaluation of the research on the effectiveness of mandatory restrictions on mortality,” according to one of the study’s co-authors, Dr. Lars Jonung, professor emeritus at the Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies at Sweden’s Lund University, “It demonstrates that lockdowns were a failed promise. They had negligible health effects but disastrous economic, social and political costs to society. Most likely lockdowns represent the biggest policy mistake in modern times.”\n\nThe comprehensive 220-page book, published today by the London-based think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, began with a systematic review of 19,646 potentially relevant studies. For their meta-analysis, the authors’ screening resulted in the choice of 22 studies that are based on actual, measured mortality data, not on results derived from modelling exercises. A meta-analysis is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for evidence, as it combines comparable, independent studies to determine overall trends.\n\nThe authors, including Professor Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University, also consider a range of studies that determined the impact of individual lockdown restrictions, including stay at-home rules to school closures and travel restrictions.\n\nIn each case, the restrictions did little to reduce COVID-19 mortality:\n\nShelter-in-place (stay at home) orders in Europe and the United States reduced COVID mortality by between 1.4 and 4.1 per cent;\n\nBusiness closures reduced mortality by 7.5 per cent;\n\nGathering limits likely increased COVID mortality by almost six per cent;\n\nMask mandates, which most countries avoided in Spring 2020, reduced mortality by 18.7 per cent, particularly mandates in workplaces; and\n\nSchool closures resulted in a between 2.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent mortality reduction.\n\nA second approach employed by the authors to estimate the effects of lockdowns on mortality combined studies that looked at specific lockdown measures (such as school closures, mask wearing, etc.) on how single non-pharmaceutical interventions were actually used in Europe and the United States. Using this approach, the authors estimate that lockdowns reduced mortality by 10.7 per cent in the spring of 2020 – significantly less than estimates produced by epidemiological modelling.\n\nThe study compares the effect of lockdown measures against the effect of ‘doing the least,’ rather than doing nothing at all. Sweden’s response to COVID was among the least stringent in Europe, but still imposed some legal restrictions and included an extensive public information campaign.\n\nVoluntary measures, like social distancing and the reduction of person-to-person contact, effectively reduced COVID mortality in Sweden, a country that did not impose draconian legal restrictions. This is consistent with evidence early in the pandemic that voluntary action began reducing transmission before lockdowns.\n\nThe authors also conclude that legal mandates only limited a relatively small set of potential contagious contacts, and could in some cases have backfired by encouraging people to stay indoors in less safe environments.\n\nIf voluntary action, minor legal changes, and proactive information campaigns effectively reduced the transmission of COVID, lockdowns were unwarranted from a public health point of view. This negative conclusion is amplified by the significant economic and social costs associated with lockdowns, which include:\n\nstunted economic growth;\n\nlarge increases in public debt;\n\nrising inequality;\n\ndamage to children’s education and health;\n\nreduced health-related quality of life;\n\ndamage to mental health;\n\nincreased crime; and\n\nthreats to democracy and loss of freedom.\n\nThe research concludes that, unless substantial alternative evidence emerges, lockdowns should be ‘rejected out of hand’ to control future pandemics.\n\nJonas Herby, co-author of the study and special adviser at the Center for Political Studies (CEPOS), an independent classical liberal think tank based in Copenhagen, Denmark, said:\n\n“Numerous misleading studies, driven by subjective models and overlooking significant factors like voluntary behaviour changes, heavily influenced the initial perception of lockdowns as highly effective measures. Our meta-analysis suggests that when researchers account for additional variables, such as voluntary behaviour, the impact of lockdowns becomes negligible.”\n\nProfessor Steve H. Hanke, co-author and professor of applied economics and co-director of the Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise at Johns Hopkins University:\n\n“When it comes to COVID, epidemiological models have many things in common: dubious assumptions, hair-raising predictions of disaster that miss the mark, and few lessons learned.\n\n“The science of lockdowns is clear; the data are in: the lives saved were a drop in the bucket compared to the staggering collateral costs imposed.”\n\nENDS\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nCONTACT: media@iea.org.uk / 07763 365520\n\nYou can download a copy of Did Lockdowns Work?

It has also received global media attention, including in the United States, Brazil, The Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden.\n\nMeta-analysis is a technique to standardise existing research and allow different results to be analysed consistently, like-for-like. The authors will continue to research and evaluate the effects of lockdowns.\n\nInitial research for this study included a systematic and comprehensive analysis of 19,646 pieces of academic literature that could have potentially addressed the topic. Of these, only 22 contained data that could be converted into standardised, comparable measurements for meta-analysis.\n\nThe study considers the impact of eight measures: (1) stay at home requirements, (2) business and school closures, (3) limits on gatherings, (4) travel restrictions, (5) mask mandates, (6) public event cancellations, (7) public transport closures and (8) internal movement restrictions;\n\nThe study’s empirical findings contradict epidemiological estimates early in the pandemic, which generally argued that strong and varied restrictions would significantly reduce COVID mortality.\n\nThe first version of this study was published as a Johns Hopkins working paper on 21 January 2022 and generated significant attention in American media, as well as in both the U.S. Congress and the White House. This study is an updated, peer-reviewed, version which clarifies and builds upon portions of the original research and responds to constructive criticism levelled against it.\n\nAbout the authors:\n\nJonas Herby is a special adviser at the Center for Political Studies (CEPOS), an independent classical liberal think tank based in Copenhagen, Denmark, where his research focuses on law and economics. Until mid-April 2020, Jonas had been confident that restrictions were effective and even published two reports where he assumed that the restrictions in Denmark were the direct cause of the differences in death tolls between Denmark and Sweden. But after observing that the first Covid waves peaked almost simultaneously in Denmark and Sweden, his interest in the effect of Covid restrictions grew. His interest turned into skepticism, and he has since then published numerous articles and reports on the subject. Herby holds a master’s degree in Economics from the University of Copenhagen and has studied one year as a special student at the University of Wisconsin – Madison.\n\nLars Jonung is professor emeritus at the Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies, Department of Economics, Lund University, Sweden. He served as chairperson of the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council 2012-13. He was Research Advisor at DG ECFIN, European Commission, Brussels, 2000-2010. Inspired by the threat of a bird flu pandemic, he initiated in 2006 a model-based study of the macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the European economy. The basic conclusion was that a pandemic would take a huge toll in human suffering but it would not cause a major economic downturn. This result was based on the implicit assumption that no restrictions on business, trade, and the movement of workers were enforced. In Swedish public debate, he opposed the use of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the evidence from his earlier work. Eventually, he teamed up with Steve Hanke and Jonas Herby to prepare this IEA book. Prior to moving to Brussels, Jonung was professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, Stockholm. He served as chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Carl Bildt in 1991-94. His research covers monetary and fiscal policy, inflationary expectations, the euro, and European integration. He holds a PhD in Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, 1975. He is the author of several books in English and Swedish.\n\nSteve H. Hanke is a Professor of Applied Economics in the Department of Environmental Health & Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University (rated as the top department for environmental health science by U.S. News and World Report’s academic rankings), and the Founder & Co-Director of The Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise. He is a Member of the Charter Council of the Society for Economic Measurement. He is also a well-known currency reformer and a currency and commodity trader. Prof. Hanke served on President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, has been an adviser to five foreign heads of state and five foreign cabinet ministers, and has held a cabinet-level rank as a state counsellor in both Lithuania and Montenegro. He has been awarded seven honourary doctorate degrees and is an Honourary Professor at four foreign institutions. He was President of Toronto Trust Argentina in Buenos Aires in 1995, when it was the world’s best-performing mutual fund. Currently, he serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. in Amsterdam. In 1998, he was named one of the twenty-five most influential people in the world by World Trade Magazine.

During this time politicians, policy analysts, scientists, and public health officials learned a considerable amount about the nature of the virus and the efficacy of lockdown policies. They understood very early on that the virus would not be as lethal as predicted, and by the fall of 2020 they knew that the lockdown policy had only marginal and short-run benefits for public health.\n\nDespite the surge of COVID-19 information, including the knowledge that generally speaking only a particular small subset of the population was especially vulnerable, government officials and politicians made no significant change to the lockdown policy. The same ineffective but extremely costly policies were repeated over and over. Furthermore, the enforcement of lockdown policies increased over time despite the overall decline in the lethalness of the virus and the increased abilities to treat it.\n\nI argue that this behaviour was the result of a “double down” political equilibrium. For various reasons, governments around the world panicked in February and March of 2020 and concluded that only a severe lockdown could isolate the virus and stop it from spreading. They quickly became aware of the failure and cost of this action and were faced with a choice: they could admit their terrible mistake or double down, continue with the policy, and hope that an endemic state would come soon. When a second wave of the virus returned in the fall of 2020, the dominant strategy of those jurisdictions that had earlier locked down was to repeat their lockdown policy. This strategy continued until the widespread infections caused by the Omicron variant led to an endemic state and allowed for a declaration of lockdown victory.\n\nThe double-down strategy required political support, and this came mostly from two sources: the “laptop class” and other winners from the lockdown; and those terrified enough by the virus that they believed lockdowns were justified. This explains three observations over the first two years of the pandemic. First, the response to COVID-19 has led to large increases in economic inequality. Increased inequality means that the relative positions of those at the top have increased, giving this group more power in the competition for goods and services. Second, there was, from the beginning, a massive campaign of fear-mongering that created false assessments of the actual risk of the virus by the general population. Third, the enforcement of lockdowns and other mandates increased over time.\n\nThe Omicron variant did two things. First, it entered the homes of a large fraction of the population and demonstrated the actual risk of the virus at that stage of the pandemic. This led to protests and rebellions as the truth became disseminated. Second, by infecting so many it allowed States to declare that the virus had become endemic. Thus, despite a sixth wave from the BA.2 variant lockdowns came to an end.'}}",97.5,2

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10670183/FEC-FINES-Hillary-Clinton-DNC-paying-firm-produced-Steele-dossier.html', 'Headline': 'FEC FINES Hillary Clinton and the DNC for paying firm who produced the ...', 'Snippet': ""Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee were fined for election finance violations over the Steele dossier that alleged Trump collusion with Russia"", 'Full_text': 'Former Donald Trump on Wednesday accused his 2016 opponent of trying to \'illegally destroy\' his campaign after it emerged that regulators had fined Hillary Clinton\'s campaign and the Democratic National Committee of failing to properly disclose spending on the controversial Steele dossier.\n\nTrump used the findings to repeat his attacks on a slew of enemies that he listed in a lawsuit last week.\n\nPayments by the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. to a law firm, he said, were \'a guise to hire numerous companies, all of whom are now named defendants in my lawsuit, to try and take down and illegally destroy your favorite president, me,\' he said in an emailed statement\n\n\'This was done to create, as I have stated many times, and is now confirmed, a hoax funded by the DNC and the Clinton Campaign.\n\n\'This corruption is only beginning to be revealed, is un-American, and must never be allowed to happen again.

When questioned by lawyers for the state of New York about who was paying him, Bartov replied that his bank statements showed some of the money was paid by the Trump Organization and some came from Trump\'s Save America PAC.\n\nThe discussion of Bartov\'s compensation came shortly after one of Trump\'s attorneys, Alina Habba, expressed her frustration to Judge Engoron about objections made by the attorney general\'s team.\n\n""Why are we wasting our time if no one is listening to the words coming out of our experts\' mouths?""

You make up allegations that never existed. There is no evidence of this.""\n\nIn his testimony, Bartov strongly disputed the grounds of the lawsuit brought by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, saying that from an accounting perspective, it has no merit. He said that Trump\'s use of disclaimers in his financial statements clearly indicated that lenders should do their own due diligence and downplayed discrepancies in the financial statements, explaining that lenders are expected to make their own independent valuations.\n\n""To me, the case isn\'t about valuations. It\'s about statements of financial conditions,"" said Judge Engoron during a tense exchange with Trump\'s attorneys on Friday. ""You can\'t use false statements in business.

He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/final-witness-delivers-blistering-testimony-against-trump-in-civil-fraud-case/', 'Headline': 'Final witness delivers blistering testimony against Trump in civil ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump, center, arrives at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, in New York.

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week. James’ office will have 90 minutes for an opening statement Monday, while lawyers for the multiple Trump defendants will have two hours.\n\nTrump and his two adult sons have denied any wrongdoing.

He proudly boasted of his real estate business — ""I\'m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements"" — and disputed claims that he had deceived banks and insurers.\n\nFeatured\n\n""This is the opposite of fraud,"" he declared. Referring to James, a Democrat whose office brought the lawsuit, he said, ""The fraud is her.""\n\nThe testy exchanges and frequent rebukes from the judge underscored Trump’s unwillingness to adapt his famously freewheeling rhetorical style to a formal courtroom setting governed by rules of evidence and legal protocol. His presence on the stand was a vivid reminder of the legal troubles he faces as he vies to reclaim the White House in 2024.\n\nIt also functioned as a campaign platform for the former president and leading Republican presidential candidate to raise anew to supporters his claims of political persecution at the hands of government lawyers and judges.\n\nFeatured\n\n""People are sick and tired of what’s happening. I think it is a very sad day for America,"" Trump told reporters outside the courtroom after roughly three-and-a-half hours on the stand.\n\nThe fraud case doesn’t carry the prospect of prison as Trump\'s upcoming criminal cases do. But its allegations of financial impropriety cut to the very heart of the brand he spent decades crafting. Engoron has already ruled that Trump committed fraud by inflating his financial statements, putting the the ex-president’s future control of Trump Tower and his other marquee properties into question.\n\nThe non-jury trial addresses other claims in the lawsuit brought by James against Trump, his company and top executives, including his eldest sons. She wants the defendants to fork over what she claims is more than $300 million in ill-gotten gains and to be banned from doing business in New York.\n\nFeatured\n\nThe civil trial is one of numerous legal proceedings facing Trump as he runs for a second term, including federal and state charges accusing him of crimes including illegally hoarding classified documents and scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election. His legal and political strategies have now become completely intertwined as he hopscotches between campaign events and court hearings, a schedule that will only intensify once his criminal trials begin.\n\nTrump has been particularly engaged in his fraud trial, aggrieved by the suggestion that he’s worth less than he’s claimed.\n\n""I’m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements,"" he said Monday on the stand, telling a state lawyer, ""You go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me, probably for political reasons.""\n\nFeatured\n\nHis testimony got off to a contentious start, with the judge turning to Trump’s attorney at one point and saying: ""I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t, I will.""\n\nThe courtroom at 60 Centre Street had already become a familiar destination for Trump, who spent days over the past month voluntarily seated at the defense table, observing the proceedings. He took the stand once before — unexpectedly and briefly — after he was accused of violating a partial gag order. He denied violating the rules, but Engoron disagreed and fined him anyway.\n\nHis turn as a witness gave him the biggest opportunity yet to respond to allegations against him.\n\nSummoned by lawyers for the state, Trump repeatedly bristled at the suggestion that he had ever intended to defraud financial institutions. He said he had been misquoted or taken too literally in past public comments about his business dealings and his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said disclaimers in his financial statements covered any missteps. He returned to a familiar position that no one had been victimized, though state lawyers contend that Trump was able to get lower interest rates and other benefits because of the wealth reflected on his financial statements.\n\n""Not one bank lost money. Not one insurance company lost money,"" he declared.\n\nTensions between Engoron and Trump — already on display in recent weeks, when the judge fined him a total of $15,000 for incendiary outside-of-court comments — were evident early on Monday when the ex-president was repeatedly scolded about the length and content of his answers.\n\nEngoron, who determined in a ruling earlier that Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, will decide the non-jury case. He cautioned at one point that he was prepared to draw ""negative inferences"" against the former president if he failed to rein in his answers.\n\n""I do not want to hear everything this witness has to say. He has a lot to say that has nothing to do with the case or the questions,"" the judge said.\n\nDespite the testy back-and-forth early in the day, Trump was later able to veer into expansive answers without anyone cutting him off, using the opportunity to rail against James, the judge and the proceedings in general.\n\n""I think that she’s a political hack, and I think she used this case to try and become governor, and she used it successfully to become attorney general. I think it’s a disgrace that this case is going on,"" Trump said.\n\nOf Engoron, Trump said, ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me.""\n\nJames, who was in the courtroom, stared straight ahead at Trump as he spoke and was seen chuckling when Trump suggested she didn\'t know anything about one of his properties, which is located across the street from her office. Afterward, she told reporters: ""He rambled. He hurled insults. But we expected that.""\n\nMonday’s testimony centered on the core of the allegations by the state attorney general: that Trump and his company intentionally inflated property values and deceived banks and insurers in the pursuit of business deals and loans.\n\nEchoing the stance taken by two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, in their own testimony last week, Trump sought to downplay his direct involvement in preparing and assessing financial statements that the attorney general claims were grossly inflated and fraudulent.\n\n""All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements,"" he said. As for the results, ""I would look at them, I would see them and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.""\n\nHe also played down the significance of the statements, which went to banks and others to secure financing and deals.\n\n""Banks didn’t find them very relevant, and they had a disclaimer clause -- you would call it a worthless statement clause,"" he said, insisting that after decades in real estate, ""I probably know banks as well as anybody. … I know what they look at. They look at the deal, they look at the location.""\n\nHe complained that his 2014 financial statements shouldn’t be a subject of the lawsuit at all.\n\n""First of all it’s so long ago, it’s well beyond the statute of limitations,"" Trump said before turning on Engoron, saying he allowed state lawyers to pursue claims involving such years-old documents ""because he always rules against me.""\n\nEngoron said, ""You can attack me in whichever way you want, but please answer the questions.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/highlights-trumps-hours-witness-stand-223846363.html', 'Headline': ""Highlights of Donald Trump's hours on the witness stand at his New York ..."", 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump speaks outside the courtroom after testifying at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)', 'Full_text': 'NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump went off. Again and again. Making the witness stand at his civil fraud trial his podium, the former president laid into the judge who\'ll decide the case and the New York attorney general who’s suing him.\n\nDuring 3½ hours of testimony on Monday, the Republican denied Attorney General Letitia James’ allegations that he duped banks by exaggerating his wealth on financial statements used to make deals and secure loans.\n\n“There was no victim. There was no anything,"" he said.\n\nHe bragged about his riches, saying he has “a lot of cash"" and described one of the grown sons he put in charge of his company as a “hard working boy."" He said of his priorities while president: ""My threshold was China, Russia and keeping our country safe.""\n\nTrump’s often verbose responses — replete with anecdotes about development projects, the intricacies of property valuations and complaints that he was a victim of a “political witch hunt” — led a frustrated Judge Arthur Engoron to warn: “This is not a political rally.”\n\nHere are some highlights from Trump\'s day on the witness stand:\n\n\'A VERY UNFAIR TRIAL\'\n\nTrump made his grievances a focal point of his testimony, amplifying complaints the 2024 Republican front-runner has made for weeks in front of TV cameras outside the courtroom.\n\nHe directed a lot of his ire against the judge, who issued a decision before the trial even began holding Trump liable for fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me without knowing anything about me,” Trump testified. “He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me. I think it’s fraudulent, the decision. I think it’s fraudulent. The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nDuring the trial, the judge has fined Trump $15,000 for violating a limited gag order barring attacks on court staff. But nothing in the order bars the former president from criticizing the judge.\n\nEngoron did try to clamp down on Trump\'s speechifying during his testimony.\n\n“I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron told one of Trump\'s lawyers. The former president retorted: “This is a very unfair trial, very, very. And I hope the public is watching it.”\n\nEngoron\'s admonition only gave Trump more ammunition to claim he was being mistreated. Trump later posted Engoron’s “not here to hear what he has to say” comment to his Truth Social account.\n\nOn the witness stand, Trump suggested the judge should\'ve showed him deference as a former president, testifying, “How do you rule against somebody and call them a fraud, as the president of the United States, who did a great job?”\n\nSTATEMENTS \'WEREN\'T VERY BADLY NEEDED\'\n\nIn defending his business practices, Trump sought to downplay the importance of the annual statements of financial condition at issue in the case. He testified that the documents, which listed values for his properties and assets, were “nice to see” but “weren\'t very badly needed” to obtain financing and make deals.\n\nEven when banks required Trump to provide copies of his financial statements as part of a loan agreement, he testified that they really wanted to know if he had enough cash to cover the loan. Trump testified that he typically kept $300 million to $400 million in the bank, saying, “I’ve had a lot of cash for a long time.""\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to,” Trump testified. “They looked at the deal. They looked at the asset. If it is real estate, they looked at the location.”\n\nRetired Deutsche Bank official Nicholas Haigh testified earlier in the trial that the bank, which loaned Trump hundreds of millions of dollars, would look to his financial statements to ensure that his “financial strength is being maintained.”\n\nTrump testified that he relied on two longtime Trump Organization executives and an outside accounting firm to prepare his financial statements. He said ex-CFO Allen Weisselberg would give him a draft before each year\'s statement was finalized and that he\'d “look it over and maybe have a suggestion.”\n\n""But it wasn’t very important,"" Trump testified. ""You’ve made it important. But it wasn’t very important to me.”\n\nA ‘VERY, VERY POWERFUL’ DISCLAIMER\n\nTrump testified that he had no qualms with how his financial statements turned out and that, if anything, they undervalued some of his properties. Regardless, he said, the statements had a “disclaimer clause that was very, very powerful"" that absolved him and his company of responsibility.\n\nTrump said the disclaimer instructed banks and others: “Do your own due diligence. Do your own work. Do your own study. Don’t take anything from this statement for granted.""\n\nThe disclaimer said, among other things, that the financial statements weren’t audited by outside accountants.\n\nTrump mentioned the disclaimer more than a dozen times, at one point irking Engoron, whose pretrial ruling found that the clause didn\'t insulate Trump from liability.\n\n“No, no, no. We are not going to hear about the disclaimer clause,” the judge bellowed. “If you want to know about the disclaimer clause, read my opinion again, or for the first time, perhaps.”\n\n“Well, you are wrong on the opinion,” Trump responded.\n\n‘A VERY SAD THING’ FOR EX-CFO\n\nAs Trump wrapped up his testimony, he expressed sorrow for Weisselberg, his longtime finance chief who pleaded guilty and served jail time last year for evading taxes on pricey company-paid perks, including a Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren.\n\nAt a trial largely built on Weisselberg\'s testimony, Trump\'s company was convicted last year of helping executives dodge taxes on such perks. The Trump Organization was ordered to pay a $1.6 million fine.\n\n“It was a sad, very sad thing,"" Trump testified. “People went after him viciously and violently because he happened to work for me.”\n\nTrump testified that he’d learned of Weisselberg’s tax misdeeds only through last year’s trial, where the ex-executive testified that his schemes were unknown to his boss. Despite the revelation about his trusted lieutenant, Trump said he never thought to go back and review Weisselberg\'s work.\n\n“The education of his grandchildren -- that is going to be some kind of a breach where you want to put a man in jail? It’s a very sad thing,” Trump lamented.\n\n‘A DISGRACE’ AND ‘DISTRACTIONS’\n\nTrump looked away from Attorney General James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he tore into the Democrat, accusing her of pursuing him to advance her political career.\n\n“She’s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,” Trump testified, adding that James “should be ashamed of herself.”\n\nTrump also directed his enmity at Kevin Wallace, the lawyer from James’ office who was questioning him, saying: “People like you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me. Probably for political reasons. In her case, definitely for political reasons.”\n\nJames made a short-lived run for New York governor in 2021 before winning reelection as attorney general last year.\n\nOutside court Monday, James said Trump was “engaging in distractions and engaging in name calling” to steal attention from the evidence against him.\n\nAT MAR-A-LAGO, ‘FOREVER’ ISN\'T NECESSARILY FOREVER\n\nTrump suggested he or his heirs could someday depart from a decades-old agreement that limits the use of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump’s financial statements have valued the sprawling Palm Beach club as high as $739 million, based on what James’ office argues is a false premise that it could be sold as a private residence. Real estate agents say it\'s possible it could fetch $1 billion as a home. Trump claims the property is now worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2002, Trump signed an agreement with the National Trust for Historic Preservation that limited Mar-a-Lago’s use to a social club. From the stand, Trump argued that language in the document stating that he did “intend to forever” use the estate as a club didn’t necessarily mean forever.\n\n“It doesn’t say I will. It says ‘intend,’” Trump testified, adding: “I would, personally, never change it. If somebody later on, including my children, if they want to change it, I believe they would have a right to do that.”\n\nShown a 2003 article in The Palm Beach Post that quoted him saying “it will forever be a club,” Trump responded, “I think that was said with bravado, as opposed to with legal intent.”\n\nTrump acknowledged benefiting from the deal, testifying that as a club “you pay much less tax.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/08/politics/ivanka-trump-fraud-trial-takeaways/index.html', 'Headline': 'Takeaways from Ivanka Trump’s testimony in the New York fraud trial - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ivanka Trump’s appearance Wednesday was the highly anticipated conclusion to an unprecedented eight days of witness testimony that included Donald Trump and three of his adult children in the ...', 'Full_text': 'Ivanka Trump’s appearance Wednesday was the highly anticipated conclusion to an unprecedented eight days of witness testimony that included Donald Trump and three of his adult children in the civil fraud trial brought by the New York attorney general’s office.\n\nThe AG’s office rested its case after hearing from the eldest Trump daughter, who was pressed about her role securing loans for the Trump Organization and a penthouse apartment she leased from her father.\n\nHer appearance was not anywhere near contentious as her father’s on Monday – there were no fireworks or angry outbursts.\n\nIn all, the attorney general’s office elicited testimony from 25 witnesses in its case against Trump, his two adult sons and his business, culminating in the testimony from the Trumps as the final four witnesses. While Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are all co-defendants in the attorney general’s lawsuit seeking $250 million in damages and to bar the former president from doing business in the state, Ivanka Trump is no longer a co-defendant in the case.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Ivanka Trump’s day in court:\n\nAG focused on Deutsche Bank loan negotiations\n\nIvanka Trump was questioned at length by Louis Solomon, a lawyer with the attorney general’s office, about the financing of loans for the Doral Golf Resort & Spa in Florida through Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe loans are a key part of the case because they required Donald Trump to submit annual financial statements – and the attorney general alleges those statements were falsified to inflate Trump’s net worth and obtain better loan rates.\n\nThe final agreement for the Deutsche Bank loan required Donald Trump, as the guarantor, to maintain a minimum net worth of $2.5 billion.\n\nOne earlier draft of the loan terms proposed by the bank required Trump maintain a $3 billion net worth. Ivanka Trump proposed a change to lower the net worth requirement to $2 billion, in an email Solomon showed in court.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s net worth on his statement of his financial condition in 2011 was $4.2 billion.\n\nTrump was able to get better terms for the Doral property with Deutsche Bank’s loan secured by Trump’s financial statements because he personally guaranteed the loans with the private wealth management group, which offered the option for a high net worth individual to back the loan.\n\nThe Trump Org. was offered different terms through Deutsche Bank’s commercial real estate arm for the same property.\n\nIvanka Trump distances herself from her apartment’s valuation on Donald Trump’s financial statement\n\nIvanka Trump said she had no knowledge about why a penthouse apartment she leased from her father’s Trump Park Avenue building was valued on Donald Trump’s financial statement at more than $12 million more than what she was able to purchase it for.\n\nIvanka Trump had a purchase option on the apartment for $8.5 million, but the value on Trump’s financial statement was $20.8 million, according to the attorney general’s civil complaint.\n\nSolomon asked Ivanka Trump whether the value of her purchase option was factored into her father’s financial statement.\n\n“As I had told you a year-and-a-half ago, I wasn’t involved in his statement of financial condition, so I can’t say what it took into account or didn’t take into account,” Ivanka Trump responded.\n\nIn her deposition last year, she said she knew that companies had financial statements, but she had no “specific” recollection that her father had personal statements of financial condition.\n\n“Sure he has accountants who have all sorts of stuff who have all sorts of statement but no, sorry, I don’t specifically know what was prepared on his behalf for him as a person separate and distinct from the organization and the properties that I was working on, so no I don’t know how they did that and who prepared that and the mechanisms like that,” she testified.\n\nHer testimony on the financial statements mirrored her brothers, who also both said they were unaware of the work that was done on Donald Trump’s statement of financial condition, even though they submitted information that was used for preparing the statements.\n\nDiscussions between Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner worked in Donald Trump’s White House as senior advisers to the president.\n\nBefore moving to Washington, they were both in the real estate business. While Kushner did not work for the Trump Organization, the couple did discuss work issues.\n\n“My husband also was in real estate and would have perspective for me so periodically we would discuss what we were working on specific to real estate,” she said when asked about the email.\n\nOver an objection from Trump’s attorneys claiming spousal privilege, Solomon asked about an email thread discussing potential funding terms from Capital One for the Old Post Office project, which was renovated and opened as the Trump International Hotel in 2016.\n\nKushner said he could show the deal to Natixis, an investment bank, because he thought they’d give Trump Org. better terms.\n\n“I don’t remember this exchange,” Ivanka Trump said of the email. “But it is not uncommon that I would ask my husband’s perspective on something I was working on.”\n\nThe attorney general’s office rests its case…\n\nIvanka Trump was the final witness of 25 in the attorney general’s case against Trump and his businesses – 24 of which were in person.\n\nIn addition to the Trump family, the attorney general’s office called former Trump Org. executive Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney – both co-defendants in the case – as well as other officials inside and outside the Trump Org. who worked on the projects at issue in the case.\n\nThe attorney general also heard from former Trump lawyer and “fixer” Michael Cohen, who testified with Trump looking on that his former boss told him and Weisselberg to inflate his financial statements (Weisselberg testified the meeting never happened).\n\nThe attorney general already won summary judgment from Judge Arthur Engoron before the trial began, as the judge rules that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud.\n\nThe judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Trump’s worth on financial statements.\n\nThe attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.\n\n… and now the Trump team gets its turn\n\nNow the Trump team gets the chance to mount its defense for the former president on Monday. Trump’s lawyers also signaled at the conclusion of his testimony earlier this week they intend to file a motion for a mistrial, including referencing the conduct of the judge’s clerk.\n\nThe motion is highly unlikely to succeed – Engoron put in place a gag order barring discussion of his staff in response to Trump’s attacks on his clerk – but it will set the tone for how Trump’s lawyers will try to poke holes in the attorney general’s case, both in the courtroom and in the court of public opinion.\n\nTrump’s lawyers offered a preview of their defense in their cross-examination of Ivanka Trump Wednesday, in which they discussed emails where Deutsche Bank was happy to have the Trump Org. as a client.\n\nTheir argument is that the attorney general’s complaint has no victim – the banks were paid back. (The attorney general’s office alleges the banks were defrauded out of hundreds of millions of dollars because of the loan rates Trump fraudulently received.)\n\nIvanka Trump said her family’s vision for the renovation of the Doral golf resort in Florida was shared with Deutsche Bank in the negotiations process for the funding.\n\n“They were quite excited about it,” she said of Deutsche Bank. “They sent teams of people down to tour the property to visit the property and to experience it in advance of our purchase.”\n\nIn his testimony on Monday, Donald Trump also previewed the defense he believes his team will put on.\n\n“We will explain that as this trial goes along, this crazy trial goes along, because we are bringing in some bankers, and the bankers will tell you – very big bankers, bankers that dealt with me, and they will explain exactly what their processes were. But these were very substantial bankers, and they will explain what the process is,” Trump said, before he was admonished by the judge for making a speech.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/trump-civil-fraud-trial-witness-list-new-york/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump and his adult children are listed as potential witnesses ...', 'Snippet': 'The former president is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York attorney general and Trump’s legal team.

Attorneys for both sides need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled earlier this week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are both defendants in the case, and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in videotaped depositions.\n\nIn civil cases, defendants can be called to testify and if they refuse, the jury, or in this case Judge Arthur Engoron, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nThe case is scheduled to start Monday. Engoron will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state after finding the former president and his business engaged in a persistent fraud by using inflated financial statements for nearly a decade.\n\nThe state is also seeking to prove the Trumps engaged in insurance fraud and falsified business records. Engoron has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nAn appeals court ruling is expected as soon as Thursday that could potentially impact the trial start date.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/06/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial/the-often-lighthearted-judge-overseeing-the-case-has-had-his-patience-tested', 'Headline': 'Highlights From Trump’s Testimony in His Civil Fraud Trial', 'Snippet': 'The 74-year-old judge, a former cabby with a shock of white hair and a penchant for cracking jokes from the bench, is both judge and jury, deciding the fate of Mr. Trump’s New York businesses ...', 'Full_text': ""Ranting and rambling as the courtroom pulsed with tension, Mr. Trump attacked New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, as a “political hack.” He derided the proceeding as “a very unfair trial.” And he scolded the judge overseeing the case, Arthur F. Engoron, for having decided before the trial that he had committed fraud.\n\n“He called me a fraud, and he didn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump exclaimed from the stand, pointing at the judge, who flashed a grin.\n\nThe outbursts demonstrated the former president’s disdain for a case that has already imperiled his family business and labeled him a fraud and a cheat. Ms. James, who has become one of Mr. Trump’s arch antagonists, has not only put his company on trial, but also called into question the richer-than-rich persona that he built over his years as a businessman and reality television star — the identity that propelled his run for the White House.\n\nMr. Trump, who was accused by Ms. James of inflating his net worth to defraud banks and insurers, acknowledged helping to assemble annual financial statements submitted to the banks.\n\n“I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions,” said Mr. Trump, who began the day looking tired but soon grew animated.\n\nAlthough the admission appeared to bolster the attorney general’s case, Mr. Trump, seated 30 feet from Ms. James, also sought to minimize the import of the financial statements, which he said he largely left to aides. He noted that they contained numerous disclaimers, making them essentially “worthless.” Banks paid little attention to them, he said, before promising, unprompted, that some of his bankers would soon testify in his defense.\n\nMr. Trump, the leading Republican contender for the presidency, brought combative campaign-trail energy to the courtroom, punctuating his testimony with grandiose claims and long-winded asides that infuriated the judge and obscured some of his more effective testimony.\n\nHe delivered an impassioned ode to his golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland, calling it an “artistic expression” and the greatest ever built. He assailed Justice Engoron: “The fraud is on the court, not me.”\n\nThe judge, who will determine the outcome of the case instead of a jury, repeatedly admonished Mr. Trump for not directly responding to questions from Ms. James’s team.\n\n“You can attack me. You can do whatever you want,” Justice Engoron told him, “but answer the question.”\n\nWhen the judge turned to Mr. Trump with a simple request — “please no speeches” — his words drew a smirk from the former president, who continued to meander. At one point, Mr. Trump interrupted Kevin Wallace, a state lawyer questioning him, with an “Excuse me, sir,” so that he could opine about what he would have done had he in fact wanted to inflate the value of his assets.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Mr. Trump scolded Mr. Wallace, later telling him that he should be “ashamed.”\n\n“People like you go around and try to demean me and try to hurt me,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Wallace.\n\nThe testimony pushed Mr. Trump far outside his campaign-trail comfort zone to the controlled environs of a courtroom, where lying is a crime and outbursts can land you in contempt of court. The deeply personal nature of the trial for Mr. Trump, 77, whose obsession with his wealth is a defining feature of his celebrity, injected an extra dose of emotion into his testimony.\n\nMr. Trump is fighting Ms. James’s civil case while facing four criminal indictments implicating him in everything from a hush-money deal with a porn star to an attempt to undermine American democracy. While the cases are a distraction during his third White House run, Mr. Trump’s lead has only grown. He has cast himself as a political martyr under attack from Democrats like Ms. James and Justice Engoron.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the testimony, Ms. James said that Mr. Trump had “rambled” and “hurled insults” but that “evidence demonstrated that in fact, he falsely inflated his assets to basically enrich himself and his family.”\n\nChristopher M. Kise, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, thought otherwise: “In my 33 years, I have not had a witness testify better,” he said.\n\nEven before Ms. James’s case went to trial, Justice Engoron had ruled that Mr. Trump’s financial statements were filled with fraud.\n\nThe trial will determine the punishment. Ms. James wants Mr. Trump to pay a $250 million penalty, be ousted from his company and be permanently barred from the world of New York real estate.\n\nOn Monday, as Mr. Wallace questioned Mr. Trump, the former president turned to the judge and lamented the way he had accepted Ms. James’s central contention before any evidence was heard in court: “You believed this political hack back there, and that’s unfortunate.”\n\n“Done?” asked Mr. Wallace, like a parent asking a child if he was finished with a tantrum.\n\n“Done,” responded Mr. Trump, and the questioning continued.\n\nThroughout the roughly four hours of testimony, Mr. Trump alternately accepted and avoided responsibility. When Mr. Wallace asked how he ensured that the financial statements were handled properly, he passed the buck to financial lieutenants and outside auditors, saying, “I gave two people total authority to work with a very expensive accounting firm.”\n\nMr. Trump added, though, that he was not entirely hands-off: “I said, ‘Prepare the statements so that the accounting firm is happy.’”\n\nFrequently, Mr. Wallace drew Mr. Trump in with simple questions about whether he had depended on the banks to rely on his financial statements. Mr. Trump affirmed that he had, without seeming to realize that the question went to intent, a necessary element for Ms. James’s lawyers to show.\n\nHe also couldn’t resist exaggerating in exactly the fashion that has left him vulnerable to the attorney general’s claims. When asked how big his triplex in Trump Tower is, he at first provided the accurate answer, 11,000 square feet. Seemingly unable to stop himself, he then said 12,000. Then, he said 13,000.\n\nMr. Trump also said that he had directed his employees to drop the value of his Westchester County, N.Y., estate, Seven Springs, because he “thought it was too high,” another acknowledgment of his involvement in the financial statements.\n\nWhile that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump’s task on the stand — to distance himself from the valuation of his net worth — parts of his testimony may have helped him.\n\nMr. Trump gave a tutorial of sorts on real estate valuations, noting that a lower cash flow in a given year might not depress the overall value of his flagship office building in the Financial District. And he pointed out that the banks he is accused of defrauding actually made money, arguing that they were hardly victims.\n\nHe also spoke about moments of restraint.\n\nWhen asked whether he approved the valuation for an office building, Mr. Trump said that he accepted it, not that he approved it, and did not instruct anyone to alter it. Asked if it was based on true and accurate information, the former president replied, “I hope so.”\n\nMr. Trump testified that he had an opinion on the worth of his properties, especially his Florida estate. “I thought that Mar-a-Lago was very underestimated, but I didn’t do anything about it,” he said. “I just left it be.”\n\nBut his expansive answers irritated the judge. As Mr. Trump spoke lovingly about Mar-a-Lago, calling it “beautiful” and a “success,” Justice Engoron looked up at the ceiling. The more Mr. Trump speechified, the more Justice Engoron rolled his eyes.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump blurted that Aberdeen was the oil capital of Europe, Justice Engoron barked, “Irrelevant, irrelevant. Answer the question.”\n\nIn a criminal case, a jury or judge cannot hold a defendant's refusal to answer questions against him. But this case is civil, and the rules are different: A judge can make what is called a “negative inference” — a damning assumption about why a defendant won’t answer.\n\nAt one point Monday, the judge, fed up with Mr. Trump’s nonresponsive responses, threatened to excuse the former president from the stand and assume the worst about why he wouldn’t answer.\n\nJustice Engoron also repeatedly appealed to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Kise, to rein in the former president. As Mr. Trump puckered his lips and shrugged his shoulders, Mr. Kise replied that Mr. Trump’s stature — as the “former and again soon-to-be chief executive of the United States” — afforded him leeway.\n\n“Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally,” Judge Engoron said in the opening moments of the testimony, adding, “We’ll be here forever, and we’ll accomplish nothing.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump got up to leave the stand at the end of the day, the judge appeared relieved. He turned to the former president and held up his left hand in a goodbye wave.\n\nKate Christobek , Maggie Haberman , Nate Schweber , Liset Cruz , Claire Fahy and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.\n\nAlmost as soon as Mr. Trump took the stand on Monday morning, his penchant for long monologues appeared to irk Justice Engoron.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump gave one particularly lengthy answer, the judge turned and asked him to restrain himself, saying that he would like to move things along. “Please no speeches,” he told the former president. Mr. Trump sneered.\n\nNext, Justice Engoron pleaded with one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Christopher M. Kise, to control his client. “This is not a political rally,” he said. When Mr. Kise said that the judge should want to hear from the former president, Justice Engoron disagreed, saying that many of Mr. Trump’s comments were irrelevant. Mr. Trump sat silent for a moment before resuming his testimony.\n\nAt one point early in the day, an exasperated Justice Engoron suggested that he might wield some of the considerable power he has over witnesses in order to rein in Mr. Trump — including booting the former president from the stand entirely.\n\nSuch a move would have been deeply damaging to Mr. Trump’s case; it would have permitted the judge to make negative assumptions about questions that the former president did not answer. For Democrats and others who have long fantasized about Mr. Trump getting what they saw as a comeuppance, that possibility was tantalizing.\n\nBut after the midmorning break, the judge appeared less interested in cutting off Mr. Trump’s off-topic soliloquies. He allowed Mr. Trump to speak at length, as the former president praised one of his golf courses as “an artistic expression” and attacked the state attorney general, Letitia James, and the lawyer questioning him, Kevin Wallace.\n\nThe judge explained why he was giving Mr. Trump more latitude: Mr. Wallace, he said, seemed to be happy with what he was getting from his combative witness.\n\nAnd so Justice Engoron said nothing when Mr. Trump referred to Ms. James as a “political hack” or even when the former president turned and attacked him directly as a fraud.\n\nRather than a war of words, the two septuagenarians turned the courtroom into a contest of irritated expressions: The judge frowned, Mr. Trump glowered. The judge grinned sarcastically, Mr. Trump smirked — and smirked some more.\n\nAs Justice Engoron repeatedly overruled Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ objections, Mr. Trump again and again turned away from him and smirked. He smirked and cocked his head. He smirked and shrugged. He smirked and looked at the ceiling.\n\nBut as the judge gave him more leash, Mr. Trump took it.\n\nAt one interval, he pointed toward the judge directly and lamented a past ruling. “He called me a fraud and he doesn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump said.\n\nBy the afternoon, Mr. Trump was letting his facial expressions convey his disdain explicitly, punctuated by the occasional outburst.\n\n“You have no case,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Wallace at one point. “This case is a disgrace.”\n\nThose comments flew without comment from Justice Engoron. But the judge had a line he would not allow the former president to cross. Shortly before the lunch break, Mr. Trump asked to read a disclaimer that was included on his annual financial statements into the record.\n\n“I’d love to read this, your honor, if I’m allowed to do that,” the former president said, laying on the charm for a moment.\n\nThe judge told him he could not, at that point.\n\n“Shocker,” Mr. Trump said, making a sarcastic face.""}}",95.625,2

Sean Hannity, who was hosting the town hall Thursday night, served up the incident as the first topic of the long Q&A session.\n\n“I want to start with the current president … did you see the video of when he fell?” Hannity began, diverging from a longstanding journalistic tradition of leading with the most important and relevant information.\n\nBut Trump failed – at least by his own standards – to capitalize on the opportunity to trash and smear an opponent. Rather than repeat half-baked nicknames, hurl insults or swamp his response with wild superlatives, Trump instead mused about why presidents can’t be seen falling onstage – even bringing his own lived experience in for a frame of reference.\n\n“Not too good. It’s sad. It’s sad,” Trump said, shaking his head. “You become president and you’re sort of not allowed to do that, but it’s happened. It’s happened. And it’s happened pretty badly. We won’t go into it. But we all know the ones and … they count those acts, they never forget but … that was a bad fall.”\n\nHannity’s naked efforts to get Trump to bash Biden’s physical vigor then backfired even more bigly as the host pivoted to Trump’s own near-slip moment in 2020, when the then-president was seen walking gingerly down a ramp after delivering a speech at West Point.\n\nBroaching the West Point moment by making excuses for it, Hannity said: “I remember the media made so much … I think you were at West Point at the time, you were coming down a ramp, it didn’t have a rail, you had dress shoes on … which have very slippery soles.”\n\nDistracted by Hannity’s open invitation to talk about himself, Trump quickly veered off the prescribed course before he was able to level any criticisms at Biden.\n\n“[Dress shoes] look a little better, but you better not walk in rain, that’s true,” Trump responded, his mind wandering to that day and his own role in it. “I think I made my best speech – that was my best speech, I was so proud of it, it was pouring – and I said, ‘This speech was so good,’ and I said ‘How do I get down,’ ‘Sir you have to go down the ramp,’ I said ‘The same one I came up?’ … it was a long, like an ice-skating rink … but I said ‘I’m not falling, no way,’ and I had to go tippy-toe down the thing … that was a mistake. Because it didn’t look so good. I even agree.”\n\nIt could not be immediately determined whether that moment of self-reflection had any known precedent. In his final thoughts on the topic, Trump continued to defy expectations by allowing that embarrassing moments can, in fact, happen to anyone – even himself.\n\n“You can’t fall,” Trump continued. “You just can’t fall. No matter what. You can’t allow it to happen. But I better not allow it – especially after saying this, I better not allow this to happen to me. But things like that do happen.”\n\nWatch the video above.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-town-hall-with-hannity-12-5-23-transcript', 'Headline': 'Trump Town Hall with Hannity 12/5/23 Transcript - Rev', 'Snippet': 'And it\'s Joe Biden, who called Donald Trump\'s supporters, a quote, ""Threat to America.""

And that\'s why Donald Trump is now beating Joe Biden in almost every major poll. Take ...', 'Full_text': 'Hannity (00:10):\n\nWelcome to Hannity. And tonight we are in beautiful Davenport, Iowa with a massive crowd. Welcome all of you. Thank you for being here. Wow. In a little more than one month, the very first Republican caucus will be held right here in this state as it should be. And by the way, in just a moment, the candidate leading the Republican field by far, Donald J. Trump, will join us for the full hour tonight. (00:39) Let\'s be clear. In 2024, the stakes could not be any higher. After three years under Joe Biden, our country is imploding on every level. Our economy is wrecked by inflation. Our southern border is an utter disaster. The American people are not safe. Take a look.\n\nSpeaker 2 (00:57):\n\nWhat I would say that is unique about the environment that we\'re in right now in my career is that while there may have been times over the years where individual threats could have been higher here or there than where they might be right now, I\'ve never seen a time where all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated all at exactly the same time. That\'s what makes this environment that we\'re in now so fraught.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:21):\n\nAre you concerned that international terrorism threats to the homeland are rising as the border continues to be broken?\n\nSpeaker 2 (01:30):\n\nI am concerned that we are in an elevated threat environment, a heightened threat environment from foreign terrorist organizations, for a whole host of reasons. And obviously their ability to exploit any port of entry, including our southwest border, is a source of concern.\n\nHannity (01:51):\n\nNow, that was the FBI director, Christopher Wray today on Capitol Hill. Make no mistake, our wide open Joe Biden border is now a massive national security nightmare. It is a clear and present danger, and it is only getting worse every day under President Biden. In the past two years, well over what? 6,000 illegal immigrants from Afghanistan have crossed our southern border, along with 3000 Egyptians, more than 600 Iranians. Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. More than 500 Syrians, 12,000 Russians, and a whopping 26,000 people from China. This is a dire national security crisis, but that is only one part of the problem. (02:37) For years, America\'s bloated bureaucracy, it has now become politicized. That includes the FBI, the DOJ, which have wasted precious time and resources with political motivated witch hunts. What they\'re looking into, traditional Catholics or angry parents that go to school board meetings or pro-life advocates that are nonviolent, Trump supporters, Donald Trump himself, instead of investigating real threats like terrorism, human trafficking, drug trafficking, gang violence, the FBI, their hyper-partisan Washington field office has obsessively, compulsively been targeting one person, one man, one family. And that\'s Donald Trump, the Trump organization and the Trump family. So now the 45th president is vowing to fight back and obliterate the deep state. Let\'s take a look.\n\nTrump (03:30):\n\nIf you put me back in the White House, their reign is over, their reign will be over, and they know it. And America will be a free nation once again. We\'re not a free nation right now. We don\'t have free press. We don\'t have free anything. In 2016 I declared, ""I am your voice."" Today, I add, ""I am your warrior. I am your justice."" And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution. I am your retribution. Not going to let this happen.\n\nHannity (04:06):\n\nThat\'s become a controversy among the left. Wrong, as he said earlier, but we\'ll play that for him and get a response tonight. Now, that\'s an important promise. America\'s weaponized, politicized bureaucracy. It\'s got to be dismantled. The far-left hacks and the media mob. Of course, they disagree. And once again, they\'re predicting doom and gloom if Donald Trump is elected. Here\'s the Washington Post yesterday, ""The fear of a looming Trump dictatorship."" And this is today\'s headline from Salon.com. ""Americans are sleepwalking into a Trump dictatorship."" That\'s now their favorite word over at fake news, all cable news channels, they\'re featuring the same brand of fear-mongering. Obviously it\'s clear they don\'t want to talk about Joe Biden and his failed record. Take a look.\n\nSpeaker 4 (04:55):\n\nDictatorship. Is that what we would have if we re-elect Donald Trump?\n\nSpeaker 5 (05:00):\n\nI think it\'s a very, very real threat and concern.\n\nSpeaker 6 (05:03):\n\nI think the phrase sleepwalking into a dictatorship should wake people up.\n\nSpeaker 7 (05:08):\n\nCorrect me if I\'m wrong. It\'s not going to be the kind of dictatorship with concentration camps and martial law overnight, is it? That\'s not what we\'re going to get. We\'re going to get Trump borrowing from the Orbán playbook in Hungary, from the Modi playbook in India. And what does that look like, Jason? What would that look like here in America?\n\nSpeaker 8 (05:26):\n\nFears of a dictatorship. The alarming prediction for a second Trump term.\n\nSpeaker 9 (05:30):\n\nLiz Cheney is right what she said that we are sleepwalking into a Donald Trump dictatorship if people don\'t wake up and remember what Donald Trump was to the four years, what he tried to do to our democracy.\n\nHannity (05:45):\n\nHere\'s the thing, we already know what would happen under a Trump presidency. Why? Because he\'s already been president. Lower taxes, stronger growth, a secure border, peace in the Middle East, new trade deals, energy independence, and a push to reform our bloated bureaucracy. There was no dictatorship. We did not lose our constitutional rights. We did not go to war. The people who hate Donald Trump, they simply have been and continue to lie to you. Now, it\'s Joe Biden who has been using the justice system, his DOJ, to inflict retribution against his political rivals. And it\'s Joe Biden, who called Donald Trump\'s supporters, a quote, ""Threat to America."" The very guy that says MAGA Republican. Oh, making America great is somehow bad. And it\'s Joe Biden, who is leading this country into the brink of yet another possible war. (06:42) And that\'s why Donald Trump is now beating Joe Biden in almost every major poll. Take a look at your screen. Latest Messenger Harris survey has Trump against Joe Biden up by six points. So now the big question, can Donald Trump seal the deal and get the country back on track? Joining us now for the full hour, the 45th President of the United States. Davenport, welcome former president, Donald Trump.\n\nTrump (07:06):\n\nThank you, man. Hello, Sean.\n\nHannity (07:06):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTrump (07:37):\n\nThank you.\n\nHannity (07:37):\n\nGreat to see you. Have a seat.\n\nTrump (07:38):\n\nThank you.\n\nHannity (07:49):\n\nBefore we get into issues, and we have a lot to get into, let\'s talk about these polls.\n\nSpeaker 1 (07:54):\n\nWe love you, Trump.\n\nTrump (07:54):\n\nI love you too.\n\nHannity (08:01):\n\nBy the way, I\'ve lost all control of this debate as well. Here we go. Let me ask you, when you look at this, you look at the polls, you see the enthusiasm. You\'ve done rallies and crowds. How are you feeling about the race?\n\nTrump (08:15):\n\nI feel great. I feel it has to be. If it\'s not, we\'re going to be in big trouble. We\'re not going to have a country anymore. We have no choice. And we have had enthusiasm. Look, we did phenomenally in 2016. We did much better in 2020. And I will tell you the enthusiasm... Some bad things happened, but the enthusiasm that they have now is bigger than either of those two races. And we\'re actually less than a year out, but close to a year. I\'ve never seen anything like it. We have crowds that are incredible in Iowa. We were here last week, we had overflow crowds, and other candidates have like seven people standing on a farm and they\'re talking, and it\'s a very nice thing to watch, especially for me. I enjoy watching that. But we have a tremendous enthusiasm because they want to see... (09:08) I see Biden talking about, oh, MAGA, MAGA. MAGA means Make America Great Again. That\'s what it means. And that\'s what people want. They want to see our country be great again. Right now, we\'re not a great country. We\'re a country in decline. We are a declining country. We\'re laughed at all over the world. People that respected us three years ago, and they respected us, you wouldn\'t have Ukraine and Russia. You wouldn\'t have had the attack on Israel. You wouldn\'t have had that withdrawal. You would\'ve withdrawn. But we would\'ve withdrawn from Afghanistan with tremendous strength and power. And that\'s the way I had it set up. In Afghanistan, we didn\'t lose a soldier. Many soldiers were being killed by snipers and others during the Obama administration. And Biden was there. I guess he wasn\'t doing so much other than collecting some cash probably. But many, many soldiers were killed. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban, I said, ""Don\'t do it. Don\'t do it."" Do you know, for 18 months we didn\'t lose one soldier in Afghanistan. Nobody knows that. (10:16) Until that fateful day where they killed our soldiers, they killed our... Think of it. They killed our soldiers. They left Americans behind, and you covered better than anybody. And they also left $85 billion of the best military equipment. Because I rebuilt the military. They left 85 billion, not million, billion dollars worth of military equipment behind in the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And the people of this country just don\'t want to take this anymore. So we gave them 85 billion. They killed our people. And they have people there, they have Americans there that we didn\'t even get out. It was like a surrender. And after that, Russia said, well, these people are incompetent. They\'re overrated. And they went in, they attacked Ukraine. That would\'ve never happened a million years. I used to speak to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye, Ukraine the apple of his eye. (11:10) And I said, ""Don\'t do it. Don\'t do it."" I won\'t tell you exactly, but it was tough. In fact, he said, ""You wouldn\'t do that?"" I said, ""Yes, I will."" ""No, you won\'t do it."" And he didn\'t believe me, but he believed me 10%. That\'s all he had to believe me. And he never did anything. I mean, he never did anything. And by the way, President Xi with Taiwan, I had the same conversation. Different cities and different countries. I had the same exact conversation. And he would\'ve absolutely... I mean, he\'s looking at Taiwan very strongly. It would\'ve never happened. And again, for four years it didn\'t happen. And it was never going to happen. And now it\'s very possibly going to happen, which would be a shame. So it\'s one of those things... Thank you. I\'d like to be back.\n\nHannity (11:58):\n\nLet me ask you this.\n\nHannity (12:00):\n\n...here earlier today, Joe Biden, I\'m sure he mumbled the words as usual, he said this: If Trump wasn\'t running, I\'m not sure I\'d be running, he said, at a campaign event today. How do you react to that?\n\nTrump (12:17):\n\nI think somebody gave him a talking point they thought that would sound good. I just found out that Democrats are funding Nikki Haley\'s campaign. I hear that Democrats are contributing to Ron DeSantis, or Ron DeSanctimonious, to Ron DeSantis\' campaign, and then you hear the talking points. That\'s the only thing they\'re good at: Cheating on elections and great talking points. (12:42) They say we want to run against Trump. They want to run. We did really well in 2016 and we did so much better in 2020. The person they don\'t want to run against is us. It\'s us. It\'s not me. It\'s us because it\'s a movement, the likes of which this country, Sean, has never seen before.\n\nHannity (13:00):\n\nAt the beginning-\n\nTrump (13:01):\n\nWe have never seen the likes of what we\'ve all done together. This is not me, it\'s everybody here and millions and millions. I think it\'s not 75 million people. I think it\'s 150 million people. It might be more than that. Who doesn\'t want to see strong borders and a strong military and low taxes and low-interest rates and go out and buy a house?\n\nHannity (13:21):\n\nI play it on purpose because I see what the media is doing now. I put a montage together. They want to call you a dictator. You use the words ""I am your retribution."" And now, before that, you said you\'ve been wronged and you used other words as well, but I want to be very, very clear on this. To be clear, do you in any way have any plans, whatsoever, if re-elected president, to abuse power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people?\n\nTrump (13:53):\n\nYou mean like they\'re using right now? In the history of our country, what\'s happened to us, again, has never happened before. Over nonsense, over nothing. Made up charges. I often say: Al Capone, he was one of the greatest of all time, if you like criminals. He was a mob boss, the likes of which... Scarface, they call him and he got indicted once. I got indicted four times. I wonder what my father and mother would say looking down.\n\nHannity (14:25):\n\nWe had a lot of private conversations in the lead up to your announcement and the day that you came down that escalator and, in that lead up, we had some passionate discussions back and forth. You were telling me that Iraq should give us oil to pay for the war and American blood should not be shed overseas in these long protracted wars. We talked a lot about that. And you have been under fire from that day forward. Russia, Russia, you talk about it all the time. Now, you face as many as four criminal trials during an election year. Now, I\'ve said this publicly, and I\'ll say it here in Iowa, I\'m not sure that Donald Trump can get a fair trial in New York, Washington, DC, I don\'t think you can get a fair trial in Fulton County, Georgia. Now, where I think you would do better in terms of real justice would be on appeal. The trials will take place during-\n\nTrump (15:21):\n\nLet\'s do it in Iowa.\n\nHannity (15:26):\n\nThere you go.\n\nTrump (15:26):\n\nHe\'s innocent.\n\nHannity (15:31):\n\nBut that has got to weigh heavy on you and what is your reaction to that, considering all the charges all stem from a couple of years ago?\n\nTrump (15:42):\n\nYeah. They could have done this three years ago and it would\'ve been long over, but they didn\'t want to bring them because they had no case, and then they saw how well we\'re doing in the polls. The two questions I get more than any other is number one, will they do it again, sir? Will they do it again? Will you stop them and we\'re going to stop them. (16:01) Number two is how do you take it? How do you get up in the morning and how do you take it? And that part is easy for me to say. I love what I do because we are going to make our country greater than ever before and it\'s so important, it\'s so important. We are going to do things. We\'re going to close the border. Day one, the border gets closed and day one and a half we drill. We drill, baby, drill. Drill, drill, drill. (16:33) And probably on day two, we\'ll get rid of this ridiculous electric car mandate. We have to go and buy a car. We\'re going to buy a car and it doesn\'t go far. There\'s a little problem. It\'s very expensive and it doesn\'t go far. They want to keep you away from going too long a distance from your home, but the whole thing is crazy. They want to make now electric army tanks and they want to make electric trucks, but the electric trucks don\'t go very far. (17:04) On a diesel-fuel truck, the big ones, great ones, you go 2000 miles. On an electric truck, you have nothing left because the battery is so large, believe it or not, it takes up most of the space, so that\'s a little problem, but it only goes 300 miles and, yet, it doesn\'t matter to them. A child would understand. Therefore, you can\'t do it. You talk about a supply chain problem, therefore, you can\'t do it. The country is sick and you say this, do they know what they\'re doing? Are they smart or do they know what they\'re doing? How could they do it? (17:36) I see John Kerry all over the place talking about we have to get rid of our coal plants, and yet China is building one coal plant a week, massive coal plants, and they\'re doing it just automatically. And John Kerry wants us to stop doing anything. We can\'t. We have a country, we have to fire up our factories. Wind is not going to fire up our factories and it\'s the most expensive energy. Even solar. I like solar from a concept standpoint, but it\'s massively expensive and we can\'t allow China to build a factory a week and we do nothing. They build a coal plant and they\'re obvious about it. And then Biden goes to see them about global warming. The only global warming we should be thinking about and worrying about, because it could happen tomorrow, is nuclear global warming. Not global warming.\n\nHannity (18:33):\n\nWe almost have to go to a break. I want to go back to this one issue, though, because the media has been focused on this and attacking you. Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody.\n\nTrump (18:51):\n\nExcept for day one.\n\nHannity (18:53):\n\nExcept for?\n\nTrump (18:54):\n\nHe\'s going crazy. Except for day one.\n\nHannity (18:55):\n\nMeaning?\n\nTrump (18:56):\n\nI want to close the border and I want to drill.\n\nHannity (18:59):\n\nThat\'s not retribution.\n\nTrump (19:05):\n\nI\'m going to be... He keeps... We love this guy. He says you\'re not going to be a dictator, are you? I said, no, no, no. Other than day one. We\'re closing the border and we\'re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I\'m not a dictator. Okay?\n\nHannity (19:18):\n\nThat sounds to me like you\'re going back to the policies when you were president.\n\nTrump (19:21):\n\nThat\'s exactly...\n\nHannity (19:22):\n\nTake a break, we\'re just getting started. We\'re in beautiful Davenport, Iowa. Donald Trump with us for the hour as Hannity continues. Thank you for being with us. And welcome back to Hannity. We are broadcasting live tonight. Beautiful Davenport, Iowa. Thank you all for coming. We continue now with former President Donald Trump, as we now head into the Iowa Caucus season, and a two part question on Joe Biden. One is about his cognitive decline and the second is about the Biden family syndicate, as I call it. Let\'s first play an RNC ad about Joe Biden. Take a look.\n\nBiden (20:21):\n\nBut the nature... Not... When the political coverage... That... Look... Some of the political players and some of the... Let me ask a rhetorical question. No, I won\'t. Anyway.\n\nHannity (21:02):\n\nNow, I could play tape from almost every day. I think another horrible moment for him was that gaggle on Air Force One after he left Israel. My question is what do you think about his cognitive state? And, number two, the issue of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden lying to the country as a candidate and president, ""I never had a discussion with Hunter or my brother or anybody for that matter on foreign business deals."" We know, according to Devin Archer, he was on phone calls. We know he was meeting with oligarchs, like the former First Lady of Moscow at Cafe Milano. Doesn\'t seem to get the attention in the media that anything involving you gets. What is your reaction to both?\n\nTrump (21:42):\n\nThey\'ve been after all of my numbers and facts and figures and they found out that it was incredible. Somebody said, you must be the most honest guy in the world because, after all these years, and they saw everything, my tax returns, they saw everything, went up to the ceiling and they saw it. He is number one, from your standpoint, cognitively, you like to use that word cognitively. He\'s not good. But it\'s not for me to say. I will say this: I just saw a commercial by these lowlifes, where they took me imitating him at a speech where we were all having a lot of fun. It\'s not really fun because we shouldn\'t be joking about it. I actually told Sean, and Sean, you shouldn\'t joke about it, it\'s serious, we\'re dealing with nuclear, we\'re dealing with-\n\nHannity (22:21):\n\nBy the way, that is a true story. You actually called me and said, it\'s not funny because I was joking about it.\n\nTrump (22:26):\n\nThat\'s not funny at all.\n\nHannity (22:30):\n\nI thought about it and I said, you\'re right. And I said, how come you never listen to my advice?\n\nTrump (22:35):\n\nBut it\'s true. It\'s actually true, unfortunately. I imitated him not finding his way off a stage. It\'s not really that hard. You\'re looking around and I walk into a wall, I say, let me see you. And I do that a lot. I just sort of... At some of our rallies and then I\'ll say, ""our real president is Barack Hussein Obama."" They\'ll say he doesn\'t know who the president is. He thinks it\'s Barack Hussein. No, I\'m being sarcastic. They imitate it, but they\'re disgraceful. (23:04) I\'ll tell you what, we are dealing, and you are dealing, I got to know them all, the leaders of the world, I got to know them all, and they\'re at the top of their game. Some are bad people, some are decent people. They all have one thing in common. They want what\'s good for their country. Whether it\'s President Xi of China or Kim Jong-un of North Korea, I saved... If Hillary had got in, you would\'ve been in a nuclear war. That would\'ve been a nuclear war. Any one of them. They\'re all... Including Macron of France. You can go to any of them. Putin. They\'re at the top of their game. (23:37) We have somebody that was never at the top of his game. 25 years ago, he wasn\'t one of the light bulbs, he wasn\'t one of the bright ones. And I tell this story: Ted Kennedy, believe it or not, was a friend of mine because of Palm Beach. They lived in Palm Beach at what\'s called the Kennedy compound. And I did him a big favor one time and somehow he liked me, I liked him, even though we were opposite in many ways,\n\nTrump (24:00):\n\nPolitically, certainly. And I said to him, ""Who\'s the smartest guy in the Senate?"" And he gave me a name, I don\'t want to tell you because I really don\'t like the guy at all. He\'s still around. I said, ""Who\'s the dumbest?"" He said, ""Probably Joe."" I said, ""Who\'s Joe?"" ""Joe Biden."" It\'s the first time. I said, ""Oh."" And that was it. (24:20) And now I see, when he\'s not in primetime for himself... I mean, years later he failed on being president when he was normal. Something is going wrong and we can\'t afford it because we have a problem today. Nuclear weapons is the single biggest problem the world has. And we have people. It used to be 10 years ago, even five years ago, even three years ago, nobody would\'ve thought about nuclear. You couldn\'t mention the word. Now, it\'s being mentioned at every meeting. Every time you talk, it\'s being mentioned. The level of power of the nuclear weapons is incredible. (24:56) Take Hiroshima or take Nagasaki, and you look, and that was many, many decades ago, and multiply that times 500, that\'s what a big bomb would be today. Whether it\'s Israel or really major countries, nuclear weapons are the biggest problem we have. (25:15) And we have a man that can\'t put two sentences together. We have a man that doesn\'t know he\'s alive and he\'s backed up by the media. The biggest problem we have, the media. The media is fake. I came up with a term a long time ago and they won\'t talk about it.\n\nHannity (25:31):\n\nLet me ask you this-\n\nTrump (25:32):\n\nIf I did some of the things that he did, they\'d reinstitute the death penalty. They don\'t want to talk about it. When he gets paid three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow\'s wife, when I brought it up at a debate, and Chris Wallace was moderating... How\'s he doing, by the way? Not too good. Chris Wallace, whatever happened to Chris Wallace? And I said, ""Why is he getting three and a half million dollars? I want to ask him that question."" And Chris Wallace interceded, because Joe didn\'t know he was alive. And so, Chris Wallace interceded and he said, ""You shouldn\'t be asking that."" And now it\'s a big subject, and I talked about it literally three years ago. (26:10) But why does all this money come in from China? We took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. We gave the farmers, by the way, $28 billion. That\'s why I say I\'m going to win Iowa. I had my people. My people say, ""Please, sir, don\'t keep saying you\'re going to win Iowa. You sound really horrible. Crass."" Somebody said crass. I said, ""But it\'s true. We\'re going to win Iowa."" I gave the farmers $28 billion and I got it from China. Who else could do that? Who else would be able to do it, number one? Who else would think about it? I think about it because the farmers were hurt very badly by China for many years. (26:50) And I asked our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, ""Sonny, how much damage has been done over the past seven years, eight years?"" He came back, $ 28 billion. I said, ""I\'m getting it from China,"" and I got it. And I told the farmers, ""Go out and buy more land and go out and buy bigger tractors."" You remember that? And I said, ""I\'m going to win Iowa because nobody else is going to be able to do that.""\n\nHannity (27:13):\n\nLet me ask you, when prominent democratic voices like Maureen Dowd and David Axelrod and Van Jones and others are so critical of Joe Biden... And of course, he is struggling cognitively. I can\'t think of in the last couple of months any appearance that he has had where he wasn\'t either mumbling or bumbling or stumbling or having no clue where to go, where to exit. Now, my question is, do you think in 11 months he will be their candidate?\n\nTrump (27:44):\n\nI personally don\'t think he makes it. Having said that, I\'m saving it for this big town hall. I personally don\'t think he makes it. I think he\'s in bad shape physically. Do you remember when he said, ""I\'d like to take him behind the barn?"" If he took me behind the barn and I went like this, I believe he\'d fall over. I believe he\'d fall over, but who knows? Who knows? Who knows? But it was okay. (28:12) And by the way, it was okay for him to say that, he said, ""I\'d like to take him behind the..."" He could say that and everyone thought it was so cute. If I ever said it, they\'d say, ""He\'s a dictator. He is a horrible human being."" It\'s a whole double standard we have. And not only in the law, but just about everything else, as you know very well. (28:29) I personally don\'t think he makes it physically. I watched him at the beach, he wasn\'t able to lift a beach chair, which is meant for children to lift. You can lift them like that. And mentally, I would say he\'s possibly equally as bad and maybe worse, but I don\'t know. I will say this, he\'s got vicious people surrounding him around that beautiful Oval Office. There are people in that Oval Office that are evil people, bad people, smart people, young, vicious. They\'re communists and they\'re bad. They\'re-\n\nHannity (29:00):\n\nWho do you think would replace them then?\n\nTrump (29:04):\n\nWell, I saw one person on, who I actually had a very good relationship with, but I\'m sure that it would end very quickly. I saw him in your debate the other night, and he\'s slick, but he\'s got no facts. He\'s got no facts. I thought he did well, considering-\n\nHannity (29:17):\n\nYou\'re talking about Gavin Newsom?\n\nTrump (29:18):\n\nYeah. Considering that he didn\'t have the facts, I thought he did well. He said, ""We have the lowest taxes in the country. We have the cleanest streets in the country."" Whiff. And I\'m saying, ""Wait a minute, is he talking about the same place?"" So, he\'d certainly be one. (29:32) I guess, they say that Kamala would be the one, the odds to be, because they say if they didn\'t give it to her, the African American vote, the Black vote would not go to them. And we just had a poll where I\'m at 22 and 25% with the Black vote. If we have that, we can pull the election over.\n\nHannity (29:54):\n\nWe got to take a break.\n\nTrump (29:54):\n\nThank you.\n\nHannity (29:55):\n\nAll right, we\'ll take a break. We\'ll come back. A lot more to cover with former President Trump. As we continue, we are in beautiful Davenport, Iowa. Thank you for being with us. Welcome back to Hannity. We are in Davenport, Iowa, with a massive, fun crowd, a rowdy crowd, and with GOP front-runner, President Donald Trump. (30:41) Let me just throw out a list of some of the significant issues that we\'re facing as a country, and you\'ve touched on a number of them. You mentioned borders, day one. You mentioned energy, day one. Look at where our economy is. Last year, 2 trillion in debt, 34 trillion overall. We, this year, Mr. President, will pay, before we spend a dime, $1 trillion on debt service alone, before Medicare, Social Security, national defense. That is unsustainable.\n\nTrump (31:13):\n\nYeah. So, before COVID hit us, our gift from China, that was our gift, what happened to us with COVID, commonly known as the China virus, they don\'t like that, but it was a China virus, we were doing energy, taking our liquid gold out of the ground at a rate that\'s never been seen before, and it was going up. We were going to be using that liquid gold to sell to Europe instead of the pipeline from Russia, which I exposed and I stopped. I stopped that line. Then they say I was nice to Russia. There was nobody that was nice. I was not nice to Russia. I stopped that pipeline. We would\'ve been selling oil and gas to Europe, to Asia, all over the world. We would\'ve been paying off debt. That debt would be way down right now because we have more... (31:58) What people don\'t know, we have more liquid gold than any other country in the world by far. And we started off in fourth place. We were number four. It was Saudi Arabia, it was Russia, it was two countries fighting for number three, and it was us at number four or five. By the time I left, we were number one by 25%. We would\'ve been number one by 100, and we would\'ve done twice what they were going to do, combined. We would\'ve been paying off debt and we would have been reducing taxes.\n\nHannity (32:26):\n\nThat\'s what I want to ask.\n\nTrump (32:27):\n\nWe gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan tax cut. We would\'ve been reducing taxes still further. And that\'s why, Sean, that\'s why we had the most jobs of any president ever, because we got rid of regulations, tremendous. No president got rid of more regulations, or close, and we gave you the big tax cuts. So, everybody had incentive and everybody was happy and everybody was working. (32:51) I remember groups came to see me that wouldn\'t normally like me, and they said, ""We\'ve never seen anything like it."" We were actually starting to get along, then we got hit with the China virus. Some people think purposely, I don\'t. I think it was incompetence, but some people think purposely, because we were doing so much better than any other country ever, and we got hit. But I will tell you, we would be paying that debt off right now at levels like never seen before. And it would\'ve been a beautiful thing.\n\nHannity (33:18):\n\nYou brought us to energy independence for the first time in 75 years. Before you ran, I remember we had many discussions about energy independence, energy independence. And you\'re saying that in a second term, you will push America to be the most energy dominant country on Earth and that you could pay down that $34 trillion in debt and we won\'t have a trillion dollar interest payment every year.\n\nTrump (33:45):\n\nThat\'s right. We will get it way down. Look, so it\'s Biden inflation. That\'s what it is. What he did with energy is unbelievable because energy went up so much; gasoline, $5, $6 a gallon. That\'s what caused inflation. Now, it\'s all over the place, but you have 29% total inflation. Now when it holds up, because the economy is starting to slow down very substantially, so when it holds up, he\'s saying, ""Well, we don\'t have too much inflation."" But he doesn\'t talk about all of the inflation that you\'ve had to suffer over the last three years. No, we will have numbers like you\'ve never seen. (34:24) We have a thing in Alaska called ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved, everybody... Bush, maybe a little bit, he didn\'t work as hard. But we have ANWR in Alaska, the biggest anywhere in the world, including probably Saudi Arabia. I got it approved. I was so proud of it. They ended it in the first week. They ended it. They told me, ""We\'ll get it back."" But we have more than anybody, we have more wealth than anybody, but we don\'t use it. (34:52) And then, guys like DeSantis and guys like many of the Democrats, but guys like DeSantis, and to a lesser extent, Nikki Haley, they want to play around with your Social Security. You don\'t have to touch Social Security. We have money laying in the ground far greater than anything we can do by hurting senior citizens with their Social Security. (35:14) Ron DeSantis wanted to bring up on Social Security... Now, of course, he says, ""Well, I wouldn\'t."" But one thing I learned about politicians, I\'ve known them, I\'ve dealt with them on the other side for a long time, their first thought is always the thought that they go to. He wanted to raise the minimum age, the age on Social Security to 70. That\'s a big increase. But he also wanted to raise it to 75. If that happened, people would be devastated. (35:38) We have such incredible wealth under our feet, that that takes care of everything. If you go to Saudi Arabia, and they bought many Boeings, many planes, and I said to them, ""Do you use financing for that?"" They didn\'t even know what the word meant. They have so much money. They have a fund, $21 trillion, it\'s all for oil. And we\n\nTrump (36:00):\n\n... we have more oil and gas than they do. Our country can be rich again. John Kerry has to be stopped. He\'s destroying our country. This guy... I mean, think of it, he goes all over the world in a private jet, by the way, he goes all over the world talking to these people about getting rid of coal plants. They all laugh at them. They treat him with respect. He\'s gone. They say, ""What an idiot. What a jerk."" And then they go ahead and they build their coal plants. (36:27) He goes to China about, let\'s say the atmosphere. He talks about global warming, he talks about... They don\'t call it global warming so much, now they call it climate change because it wasn\'t working. Global warming wasn\'t working when it was cooling. So now they call it climate change, that takes care of everything. (36:45) I am an environmentalist, but we\'re going to destroy our country with this Green New Deal stuff that doesn\'t work. (36:52) Just to finish, we have so much wealth and power under our feet. No other country has it. China doesn\'t have it. Why are we going to electric? They do have what you need to do the batteries, but they don\'t have what you need to do the gasoline. And it\'s what people want to drive. Right now, and there\'s a little story about it, but you\'re going to see it a lot, I guarantee you. They have so many electric vehicles, nobody wants to buy them. They\'re expensive. Although you\'ll probably get the pretty cheap now, nobody wants to buy them.\n\nHannity (37:25):\n\nBy the way, 3,000 dealers around the country wrote Biden and said, ""Please stop making us sell something they don\'t want."" Ford lost four-\n\nTrump (37:32):\n\nPeople don\'t want them.\n\nHannity (37:32):\n\n... and a half billion dollars. Let me ask you this-\n\nTrump (37:34):\n\nYou know the government is subsidizing that?\n\nHannity (37:36):\n\nA lot, they\'re paying a lot.\n\nTrump (37:37):\n\nSo this thing, every time you make a car, we give you thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. And the people don\'t want them. And I\'m not knocking electric cars. We should sell electric, but we should also sell a combustion engine gasoline cars. We can sell hybrids. The hybrids are fine. We should be able to buy everything. Some people might like an electric car. We should be able to buy an electric car. (38:02) But to say that we\'re not going to do... And this is our strength because we have this stuff under the ground and we have people going around really destroying our country. They\'re destroying our country at the border. They will allow, in my opinion, because you don\'t hear the real numbers, 15 million people into our country by the time Biden gets out, which hopefully will be very soon. (38:24) If they get another term, this country is finished. By the time he gets out, and the people are coming from prisons all over the world, they\'re coming from mental institutions all over the world and they\'re terrorists. And this country is going to be suffering a very big price.\n\nSpeaker 10 (38:41):\n\nWe need you.\n\nTrump (38:42):\n\nIt\'s amazing that it hasn\'t happened. And interestingly, I had very strong borders, the strongest ever. We had the strongest border in history. All they had to do is leave Brandon Judd and leave Tom Holman and leave all these guys. We had the strongest borders-\n\nHannity (38:59):\n\nLet me put this up on the screen.\n\nTrump (39:00):\n\nYeah, we had the strongest borders in history-\n\nHannity (39:00):\n\nLet me put this on the screen.\n\nTrump (39:00):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nHannity (39:02):\n\nIran is the number one state sponsor of terror.\n\nTrump (39:04):\n\nRight.\n\nHannity (39:04):\n\nOkay. Well, foreign nationals founded our southern border because of Joe Biden\'s Open Borders, from Iran 659, from Syria 538, from Afghanistan 6,386, Egypt 3,153. 12,605 from Russia, 26,113 from China. Now, could you explain to me, what do you think the odds are that among that group of people from our top geopolitical foes, in most cases, that terror cells have entered the country because of the 8 million people Joe Biden has allowed into this country unvetted? What are the odds?\n\nTrump (39:46):\n\nThe odds are 100%. Look, why do we have 26,000 people?\n\nHannity (39:50):\n\nHow scary is that?\n\nTrump (39:50):\n\nThink of it. No, it\'s a hundred percent. And by the way, we had nothing during my... Remember I had the travel ban. I said, ""I don\'t want people coming from countries that want to blow us up."" And we put a travel ban. And some people thought I was discriminating. (40:05) But if you think about it, I went four years with no problem. We didn\'t have any problem. We didn\'t have buildings being knocked down. We didn\'t have World Trade Centers. We didn\'t have any of that. No, we had a very strong travel ban. And if you came from a country that was a country I can tell you right now, I can name every one of them, we just didn\'t want you. I\'m sorry. And we actually had it passed by the Supreme Court and that was a big day. But we didn\'t have a problem.\n\nHannity (40:33):\n\nGot to take a break. We\'ll come back more with that from Davenport, Iowa with former President Donald Trump straight ahead, as we continue. (40:58) Welcome back to Hannity Broadcasting from Davenport, Iowa. Thank you so much for being here. We continue with former President Donald Trump. The Iowa Caucus is coming up soon. Let me give you the last word tonight. The people of Iowa, the first caucus, not that far away. Your final message to the people?\n\nTrump (41:18):\n\nWell, first of all, I love this state. We had two big victories here. Big, big victories. We won by a lot. We won by a lot. (41:25) And from the enthusiasm and the polls we\'re going to win by a lot more than we won even the last two times. But we won by a lot. I kept you first in the nation. You know that I was the one, nobody else. I kept you first. (41:40) There was a big move, Sean, to move Iowa into the middle or to the back of the pack because they don\'t know if it represents this country. I said, ""Iowa represents this country more than any place. And it also represents tradition."" (41:54) When you think of Iowa, you think of farms and you think of politics and we\'re going to keep it that way. But I want to thank the people in this room because they really get it. I don\'t have to go through the liquid gold with them. They know all about it. And they also know they have their own liquid gold, it\'s called corn. And that corn is just as good. (42:14) But I love you very much. You\'ve been so incredible to me. I\'m going to be around for the next... it\'s five weeks now and we\'ll be coming here a little bit. And then the last couple of weeks we\'ll be blitzing because we don\'t want to take... We\'re up I guess by 30 or 40 points, but we\'re not taking any chances. We don\'t want to take any chance. (42:32) And the really nice thing, you know when you have a good time and when you love people and they love you, this hour went so fast. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nHannity (42:46):\n\nPresident Donald Trump. Unfortunately, that\'s all the time we have left this evening.

CNN held a town hall meeting for Trump; the L.A. Times still shows Trump’s picture frequently in some articles. Even President Biden doesn’t get that kind of attention. It’s time to stop giving free publicity, especially to an incompetent candidate.\n\nI know ratings and ads support the various forms of media, but the media owes the public equal opportunity in their reporting. Trump does not deserve more publicity than other candidates, just because he does things to create attention. No one person should be considered more important than anyone else.

By tens of millions of my fellow Americans who watch Fox News and therefore live in a fact-free alternative reality and believe lies about voter fraud and too many other myths and unfounded conspiracy theories.

It’s hard to know whether Trump actually believes the grotesque distorted view of reality that he espouses.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nPaul Begala: Trump whined, griped and complained\n\nMore than 400,000 Americans died from Covid-19 during the Trump presidency. 2.9 million Americans lost their jobs while former President Donald Trump was in the White House. Opioid deaths skyrocketed, and the national debt exploded by $7 trillion during Trump’s tenure.\n\nBut in tonight’s CNN town hall, Trump told us who the real victim of this era is: Donald Trump.\n\nFrom the opening question to his last comment, Trump whined, griped and complained. It was an airing of grievances that will doubtless thrill his MAGA base, but may well motivate anti-Trump voters just as much. And there’s little indication he did enough to win over independent voters.\n\nThis was vintage Trump: whining about the election he lost, grumbling about being indicted in New York, moaning about the jury that found him liable for the civil offense of sexual abuse and defamation. He used the first-person pronoun in nearly every sentence, sounding like a tenor warming up for the opera: “Me, me, me, me, meeeeee.”\n\nHe failed to acknowledge the very real pain felt by so many Americans – including the millions who voted for him. There was not a hint of empathy for the heroic cops who were brutally attacked on January 6. Not a mention of the struggling rural families wrestling with the demon of opioid abuse. Not a word of thanks for veterans and their families. Not a thought for the tens of millions of women whose rights have been rolled back by Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices – just triumphant boasting about how he was the GOP president who actually delivered on the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt’s all about him. It always has been. Trump is a narcissist in a hall of mirrors.\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.\n\nJill Filipovic: Trump needs women to win in 2024, but he doesn’t seem to care\n\nIf female voters are key to a Donald Trump victory in 2024, the former president should be in big trouble – but he doesn’t seem to care.\n\nAfter being found liable for sexual abuse by a New York jury earlier this week, Trump took to the CNN town hall stage Wednesday night and proceeded to mock and berate Kaitlan Collins, the female anchor questioning him (a “nasty” person, he called her) after mocking and berating E. Jean Carroll, who just bested him in court. And to boot, he boasted about his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a move that cost many Republicans elections.\n\nA man whose misogyny was so extreme and unvarnished he inspired the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement is back. On Wednesday night, he made clear that he’s as sexist as ever – something that didn’t seem to bother many in the crowd.\n\nThe town hall audience – selected on the basis of their intention to vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire – appeared to be made up mostly of Trump fans. The crowd generally cheered Trump and his sentiments disparaging whichever woman was in his crosshairs.\n\nThe targeting of Carroll was particularly egregious, considering that a jury just penalized Trump to the tune of $5 million for what they found to be his sexual abuse of Carroll and his defamation of her for calling her claims a “hoax” and a “con job.” At the town hall, he again denied Carroll’s claims, and then turned her into a joke, cruelly laying into her while his fans cheered and jeered.\n\nMany of those fans, of course, were women. There are a significant number of female voters, the overwhelming majority of them White, who are either so accepting of or so used to rank misogyny that they have no issue voting for a man who has boasted about grabbing women’s genitals and whom a jury believes is more likely than not a sexual abuser. And there are, of course, a greater number of men who find Trump’s misogyny excusable enough to cast their ballots in his favor – and even applaud him.\n\nTrump’s attacks on and ridicule of various women in such a short span of time were a harsh reminder of who he is. The question is whether voters in 2024, unlike so many in 2016, will care.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nScott Jennings: This is how Trump won in 2016\n\nTrump likely agreed to the CNN town hall to show he’s vigorous enough to handle the rigors of a campaign and ultimately another term in the White House. He surely wants to make a clear comparison to President Joe Biden, who rarely takes questions from the press and frequently struggles with prepared remarks. Polling has shown voters have significant concerns about Biden’s fitness for office, and Trump, should he become the GOP nominee, would benefit if the race was decided on those grounds.\n\nThere’s simply no contest between Trump’s ability to have a quick-paced back-and-forth with a reporter and Biden’s. On Wednesday night, he bullied his way through questions about the 2020 election, the Capitol riot on January 6 and this week’s judgment against him for defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile this may turn off most American voters — particularly critical suburban independents in swing states — it will thrill many Republican primary voters who love to see him bulldoze his way through questions from CNN and other mainstream outlets. The Republican-leaning audience in attendance was clearly pleased with what they heard.\n\nTo analyze this town hall, you have to understand that Trump speaks a language that is understood by his biggest supporters and most GOP primary voters but is not and has never been understood by the media or the Democrats.\n\nIt has never proven to be a language that can attract more voters in a national popular election. But he’s still the master of this language, which he invented back in 2016, and Wednesday’s engagement will be judged a complete success by his campaign as it tries to lock up the 2024 nomination.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nAshley Allison: Now is the moment to stop Trump\n\nAlert! This is not a test. Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and on Wednesday night there was an audience of voters applauding for him in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking to them, Trump wouldn’t say he regrets January 6. He wouldn’t say which country he wants to win the war – Russia or Ukraine. Trump wouldn’t say he would not sign a national abortion ban. He wouldn’t say he lost the 2020 election. Trump even thought the US should default on its debt.\n\nAmerican voters, say where you stand so the record will reflect it. This means you must be able to assert: There should not be a federal abortion ban. I stand with Ukraine. Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And January 6 was an insurrection based on lies. If you cannot say these things, you have betrayed your democracy.\n\nTo the majority of Americans who believe these truths, according to a Pew Research survey, say them out loud – proudly and constantly. Commit to put country over politics, democracy over tyranny, justice over abuse.\n\nThis is bigger than any political party. This is bigger than any one candidate. This is the moment to be a patriot and stop Trump from ever again serving as President of the United States.\n\nThat’s it. That is the clarion call. Alert!\n\nAshley Allison is the CEO of Turner Conoly Group. She is a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama and former senior aide to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nFrida Ghitis: If Trump wins, Putin will be happy and Ukraine will suffer\n\nWatching Trump once again disparage American democracy, it’s not particularly surprising to learn that if he became president again, he would not help Ukraine win the war to repel Russia’s brutal aggression and invasion of its territory.\n\n“We’re giving away so much equipment,” he lamented. And when pressed to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, Trump refused to answer.\n\nHe repeated his claim that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if he were president. The reality is likely quite the opposite.\n\nAs president, Trump delayed sending support that Ukraine was urgently requesting and Congress had already approved – and was impeached. His clashes with allies and the divisions he fomented likely gave Russian President Vladimir Putin the impression that NATO might not stand together to help Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump becomes president before the war is over, there is every chance that he could clog up the pipeline of support from the United States – the world’s leading democracy – for Ukraine, another democracy that is under brutal attack. And there is absolutely no doubt that he would reignite the clashes between the US and its NATO allies, which threatened to unravel an alliance that is now reinvigorated, with a new sense of mission, and a crucial role to play.\n\nTrump had already showed his cards on Ukraine in a recent interview with Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity that “Ultimately, [Putin] is going to take over all of Ukraine.” If Putin does erase Ukraine from the map, there is reason to believe Trump would not find that terribly objectionable.\n\nFrida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review.\n\nAlice Stewart: Trump needs to come up with better answers on abortion\n\nAbortion policy stood out at Trump’s town hall Wednesday night. He managed to tout his pro-life record without boxing himself into a corner on a federal abortion ban. While this is a strategic answer, it could prove to be problematic for Trump.\n\nWhen asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected, Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.”\n\nTrump is clearly playing to the general election audience.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, about two-thirds of adults believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while almost a third say it should be illegal. This play to the general election voters could cost him some GOP primary support.\n\nThere’s no question, the pro-life community considers Trump the most consequential president in American history on abortion. Evangelicals rallied in support of Trump for his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who made history in overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nThe problem is, Trump’s past performance on protecting the sanctity of life is strong, but his future commitments are about to be put to test in the 2024 GOP primary. Other Republican primary candidates have committed to signing a federal abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. This policy distinction will not go unnoticed.\n\nSusan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America has indicated they will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to support at minimum a 15-week national standard on abortion.\n\nAn endorsement from SBA and other pro-life organizations is vital in a Republican primary. A states-only position on abortion is not acceptable for the pro-life movement. Trump may need to come up with a better answer to keep the pro-life community in his good graces.\n\nAlice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President.\n\nRaul A. Reyes: Trump’s words about family separation were chilling\n\nIn 2015, candidate Donald Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his improbable run for the presidency by referring to immigrants as “rapists” and criminals.\n\nIt seems that not much has changed in the years since – as the now-former president is unrepentant in his anti-immigrant views. In his CNN town hall on Wednesday, Trump claimed “people” were “coming in” after being released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that migrants are coming to the border from mental institutions or prisons. The former president also doubled down on his horrific (and unpopular) family separation policy at the border and reiterated his false claim that he built “hundreds of miles” of the border wall.\n\nTrump’s language regarding immigrants was not only divisive, it was – and is – dangerous. It seems that he has learned nothing about the power of his words to drive anti-Latino violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso in 2019. And any possibility of a return to the family separation policy, which was truly a dark time in US history, is absolutely chilling.\n\nSadly, based on applause, Trump’s ugly rhetoric seemed popular with his not-so-diverse audience at Saint Anselm College. Yet New Hampshire is hardly representative of the US overall, and Trump said nothing tonight that might win over new voters.\n\nKaitlan Collins fact-checked Trump vigorously, but this town hall often felt like a Trump rally. On immigration, as well as myriad other issues, Trump was entirely predictable and misleading. We have all seen this act before, and it’s really, really tired. If Trump’s campaign was hoping to gain any new supporters or showcase a new image for the former president, this evening represented a resounding failure to launch.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes.\n\nSE Cupp: This was a brutal reminder that Trump isn’t defeated\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m fairly dejected after watching Wednesday night’s Trump town hall in New Hampshire.\n\nOur job, as journalists, is to hold powerful people accountable and ask them tough questions. Our intrepid anchor Kaitlan Collins did just that. However, the premise is that the person in power on the receiving end of those questions will answer them. What Trump did was hijack a town hall to do what he always does – distract, deflect, lie, insult his opponents, insult his questioner and play to his base, who loves it all.\n\nWatching Trump do this for over an hour, as a clearly packed crowd of his supporters applauded and laughed at his lies and smears, was a brutal reminder that Trump is not defeated, he is not chastened nor is he irrelevant. It was also a warning that these kinds of events, however well-intentioned, are not in the best service of democracy, transparency, accountability or any of the other things good journalism efforts at.\n\nSE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.\n\nMondaire Jones: America is in greater danger than we thought\n\nThe audience reactions during CNN’s presidential town hall with Trump show that America is in greater danger than perhaps many of us thought.\n\nThe assembly of Republican and “undeclared” voters at St. Anselm College in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire stood behind Trump, raucously applauding the former president throughout the night despite the stream of falsehoods he uttered — including lies about the 2020 election being stolen.\n\nThey applauded when he said he would consider pardoning “a large portion” of the January 6 insurrectionists, whose violence he greatly downplayed. They also laughed when he mocked E. Jean Carroll, who won a civil lawsuit against him on Tuesday, with a federal jury finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.\n\nThese reactions show how entrenched Trumpism is within the Republican Party. The audience members who applauded Trump’s lies and immoral behavior on stage represent a Republican electorate that largely rejects widely disseminated, clear evidence contradicting what it wants to believe or — worse — knows is the truth and doesn’t care.\n\nMondaire Jones is a CNN political commentator and former Representative for New York’s 17th Congressional District. He also serves as a member of the US Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nGeoff Duncan: Trump is stuck in 2020, and so far the GOP is too\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage at Saint Anselm College as the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, but it’s clear that his mindset is still stuck in 2020.\n\nFrom accusing former Vice President Mike Pence of doing something “wrong” on January 6 to defending his “perfect” call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a defiant Trump dug in on the election denialism that has come to define his presidency. He refused to back down from the disproven claims that there was widespread election fraud in 2020, and even labeled January 6 a “beautiful day.”\n\nOn the major policy issues of the day – immigration, federal debt, abortion – he offered little, if anything, in the way of specifics. He barely took the time to remind voters about the rightful accomplishments of his presidency, like the significant tax cuts that were enacted in 2017.\n\nThe town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his fitness for office. But Trump squandered the opportunity to exploit Biden’s weaknesses, and instead of using the primetime appearance to appeal to swing voters in the suburbs, he played the base’s greatest hits.\n\nStill, Trump’s charisma and showmanship were undeniable. The crowd roared with applause at multiple moments. Thus far, it’s undeniable that Trump is the leader of the GOP pack.\n\nIf Republicans fall for his snake oil again, we have no one but ourselves to blame if we lose another election.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-cnn-town-hall/h_02b7052af063924b5fc896c418f7e8ef', 'Headline': 'Trump town hall on CNN: Live updates | CNN Politics - CNN International', 'Snippet': 'The Biden campaign is already working to pinpoint moments from the town hall that they can turn into ads and digital content, including Trump’s comments on January 6, election denialism ...', 'Full_text': 'The 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.\n\nTrump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.\n\nHere are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:\n\nTrump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nTrump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.\n\nTrump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.\n\nTrump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”\n\nTrump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.\n\nTrump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.\n\nRead more takeaways from tonight’s town hall here and read our team’s fact checks here.\n\nOne of the many jarring moments during CNN’s town hall with former President Donald Trump occurred when the moderator, CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, was asking Trump why he held on to classified documents when he left the White House. The FBI later recovered them from Mar a Lago by executing a search warrant.\n\nWhen Collins pointed out that the difference between Trump and Joe Biden, who also faces questions about classified documents found at his house but who didn’t ignore a subpoena, Trump interrupted her.\n\n“Are you ready? Can I talk?” Trump demanded. “Do you mind?”\n\n“Yeah, I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it,” Collins said.\n\n“It’s very simple that you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said, attempting to insult her as his supporters in the crowd cheered.\n\n“Can you answer why you held on to the documents?” Collins asked again, at which point Trump launched into a rambling answer that boils down to he was negotiating with the National Archives during the year-plus when the government was seeking them.\n\nIt’s the insult to Collins’ face, calling her “nasty,” that was jarring. And the cheering crowd made it more so.\n\nThe word has long been a favorite insult of Trump’s, often hurled at women who frustrate him.\n\nHe called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” at the close of the final presidential debate in 2016.\n\nHe’s used it on Vice President Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOf Meghan Markle, who had criticized him, in 2019, Trump told a British newspaper, “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”\n\nAfter he hurled the insult at Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen later that summer, the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake documented 14 times Trump had used the insult to describe a woman. He found even more instances of Trump using the word to describe a man, although some of those appeared to be complements.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that the classified documents from the White House were “automatically declassified” when he took them to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence to back up this assertion. Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so.\n\nThe Justice Department said in an August 2022 court filing that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified—not in January 2022 when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings, nor in June 2022 when Trump’s team responded to a subpoena by returning another batch that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\nIn addition, 18 former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN at the time that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump asserted Wednesday night that “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.\n\nFacts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying of the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe January 6 riot of by Trump supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.\n\nThe number of rioters who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees. That includes more than 100 people charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer. About five dozen have pleaded guilty to felony charges for these types of crimes.\n\nAnd the FBI is still seeking information to identify more than 220 others who may have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds.\n\nEven Trump-appointed federal judges have countered claims that left-leaning rioters in Portland, for instance, acted similarly to the pro-Trump crowd on January 6.\n\nJudge Trevor McFadden wrote when handling a January 6 rioter’s case in 2021: “Although both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse. In contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it.”\n\nAnd another federal judge in DC, Carl Nichols, wrote: “The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America’s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings’ outer defenses.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s answers to questions from New Hampshire voters about a variety of topics at the CNN town hall Wednesday may have opened the door for other Republicans to challenge him in the 2024 presidential primary race, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House director of communications and CNN political commentator, said.\n\nThe former president often dodged directly answering questions and giving specific policy stances in the town hall, such as not saying if he would sign a federal abortion ban or if he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the war. Trump repeated his election lies and attempted to repaint his role during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nIssues like crime and the economy, however, are what are on the minds of most voters on a day-to-day basis, Farah Griffin said.\n\nFarah Griffin pointed to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ super PAC criticizing Trump as an example of how other candidates could be taking advantage.\n\n“After 76 years, Trump still doesn’t know where he stands on important conservative issues like supporting life and the 2nd amendment. How does that Make America Great Again?” the statement said.\n\nThe super PAC in a tweet also touched on several issues including possible pardons for January 6 rioters and the investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — topics that DeSantis has not criticized Trump over and in some cases has outright avoided discussing at all.\n\n“This to me actually became an opening for a Republican to take him on and say, if you want a lot of the policies — not insane things like family separation — and you don’t want chaos and anti-democratic positions,” Farah Griffin said.\n\nCNN’s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed reporting to this post.\n\nFormer and current Republican governors reacted to former President Trump’s claims throughout CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday evening.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu: The Republican governor told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Trump didn’t say anything that he thinks will help him win the GOP nomination for president. “It was kind of the same old thing, the same old regurgitation. He had a chance to move on from 2020, he didn’t do it. He had a chance to own some of the issues of January 6, what his role there was. He didn’t do it. He had the chance to take shots at Joe Biden, he didn’t do it,” Sununu said.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: After Donald Trump said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, the Republican tweeted that “despite how ridiculous that is to say, I suspect he would try to do it by turning Ukraine over to Putin and Russia. #Putin’sPuppet.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson: The 2024 challenger to Trump said on CNN that the former president “had a weak performance and he’s locked in the past.”\n\n“He had a goal, I’m sure, to expand his base to be able to prove that he can attract independents and the suburban voters. He failed that test. He narrowed his base of support, he’s locked in the past, he didn’t address the issues (of) the future,” the Republican said.\n\n“Whenever he was asked about the economy, he gave one brief response on energy policy, but really didn’t address the broad range of things we have in our economy to get it going again,” he added.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took questions from Republican and undeclared voters in New Hampshire at the town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump remained defiant about his lies regarding the 2020 election, as well as the many investigations into him – making clear that he’s sticking to the script he’s delivered over the past two years on conservative media.\n\nHere is some of what he said on key topics:\n\nElection lies: Trump again refused to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election several times, and instead reiterated false claims that the election was rigged. CNN’s Collins continuously pushed back and pointed to statements by Trump’s own election officials noting the election was conducted fairly. He later only said he would accept the 2024 presidential election results if he believed they were “honest.”\n\nJanuary 6 insurrection: Trump blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among others, saying they were at fault for the security failures on January 6, 2021. Trump falsely claimed that he called on the National Guard to intervene during the riot and in an extended exchange with Collins about the riot, Trump attempted to repaint his role during the insurrection. He also said he would pardon “a large portion” of rioters.\n\nMike Pence: Trump said that he does not feel like he owes his former vice president an apology. Pence has said the former president endangered his life during the January 6 insurrection. “No, because he did something wrong. He should’ve put the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would’ve had a different outcome,” Trump said, though Pence did not have the authority to reject election results.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Trump continued to deny knowing the columnist and denied accusations, just a day after a jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her in a department store. The former president also ridiculed Carroll and said he does not believe the verdict disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nThe economy: If reelected, Trump said his solution to inflation would be drilling for more oil in the US. The former president then claimed that under his presidency, the country was energy independent and that the cost of gas went down to record lows. You can read a fact check on those claims here.\n\nThe debt ceiling: Trump said the US should default on its debt if the White House does not agree to Republican spending cuts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit. The White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue.\n\nGun violence: The former president pledged to protect the Second Amendment if he is back in the White House. He said he would address mental health problems as well as “do numerous things” to address mass shootings, including hiring more security guards for schools and what he called “hardening” entrances to establishments.\n\nAbortion: Trump would not say if he would sign a federal abortion ban if he was reelected or at how many weeks during pregnancy he would support a ban. Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.” He argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe war in Ukraine: Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Russian President Vladimir Putin and solve the war in Ukraine “in one day, 24 hours.” He would not say if he believed Putin was a war criminal and said the Russian leader “made a mistake” going into Ukraine, arguing he wouldn’t have done so if Trump was president. Trump wouldn’t say whether he wants Ukraine or Russia to win the war.\n\nClassified documents: The former president insisted that he had “every right” to take classified documents with him after he left the White House. He falsely claimed that the documents became declassified when he took them with him.\n\nAsked why he took classified documents with him after leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump said he “had every right to under the Presidential Records Act.”\n\n“I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,” Trump said during Wednesday night’s CNN town hall.\n\nCollins corrected Trump saying the Presidential Records Act does not say a former president can take documents home but says they are the property of the federal government when a president is out of office.\n\nAfter Trump and Collins went back and forth on previous presidents taking classified documents, Collins pushed back saying previous presidents didn’t wait to return classified documents and asked numerous times why Trump waited to return classified documents when he knew the federal government was seeking them and subpoenaed him to return them.\n\nTrump did not answer the question but instead insulted Collins.\n\n“It’s very simple — you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday would not say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected when pressed several times by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, but argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country” when asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nAs many states move to restrict abortion rights after the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion, Trump would not specify whether he would support a federal ban or at how many weeks during a pregnancy he would support a ban.\n\n“I’m looking at a solution that’s going to work. Very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue, but we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren’t able to get rid of, you wouldn’t be having a discussion, if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe V. Wade,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: In the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have enacted sweeping abortion restrictions. But unpopularity, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, over severe restrictions has prompted Republicans to reconsider the political wisdom of enacting near-total bans on the procedure, and House Republicans have recently stepped away from pushing a federal abortion ban.\n\nMarta Saravia, an undeclared voter, asked former President Donald Trump what he thought of the debt situation and how the country can move forward.\n\n“We have to start paying off debt … I say to the Republicans out there — Congressmen, Senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.\n\nCollins asked Trump to clarify, asking him if he thinks the US should default if the White House does not agree to spending cuts the Republicans are demanding.\n\nMore context: The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nThe White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue. House Republicans want to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.\n\nA breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he does not think a recent verdict in which a Manhattan federal jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nHe denied knowing the columnist and denied the accusations. Trump ridiculed Carroll while discussing the trial, only a day after the verdict was handed down.\n\n“A Manhattan jury found you sexually abused writer E. Jean You’ve denied this. But what do you say to voters who say it disqualifies you from being president?” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked.\n\nTrump answered that he didn’t think there were many voters who would think that. He claimed that the case was made up and that it was all politically motivated. He repeated that he did not know Carroll, but said that he took a photo “years ago” with her and her husband.\n\nWhen asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nSome context: A Manhattan federal jury found Tuesday that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the spring of 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nCarroll alleged Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict.\n\nWhile the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.\n\nCarroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill that opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation.\n\nThere’s a definite feel at Saint Anselm College that the 2024 presidential campaign is really beginning tonight. There’s excitement, tension and dissent in the air that recalls the build-up to a presidential debate.\n\nThe fact that the unpredictable Donald Trump is the presidential frontrunner after a tumultuous presidency and refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election is only deepening the feeling that something big is about to happen – as town hall attendees line up to clear Secret Service security checks near protesters shouting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nMany of the registered Republicans and voters who plan to vote in the 2024 GOP primary are hoping they will get called upon.\n\nOne Trump supporter, Karen Langella, said that she hoped that the questions would “not focus on what happened” on Tuesday when a jury found Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 in New York and that he was liable for battery and defamation after a civil trial.\n\nLangella’s daughter, Isabella, who is an independent and shopping around for the most conservative Republican candidate, hoped that “people stick to his ideas and his policies instead of what happened 20 years ago.”\n\nAnother attendee, Al Peel, hoped to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on how to help homeless veterans. He also wanted the former president to tone down his wild antics and focus instead on policies.\n\n“I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results,” he added.\n\nAcross the road, a crowd of students held up signs reading “love Trumps hate” and “nobody is above the law,” while chanting “You’re abhorrent, you’re broke, you lost the popular vote.”\n\nMore about the town hall location: Saint Anselm College has its own fabled history in presidential campaigns. Republican Richard Nixon made it his first stop in his successful 1968 bid for the presidency. Pretty much every one who is anyone in presidential politics has visited — from Ronald Reagan, both presidents Bush, Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe Benedictine liberal arts college hosted a fiery Democratic presidential debate days before the 2008 primary that saw Hillary Clinton win a comeback victory after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses — though it was a false dawn for the then New York senator’s campaign.\n\nIt’s long been known that former President Donald Trump’s actions while in office have upended the norms of the presidency — from his use of social media to make major announcements to his use of the pardon power to the amount of turnover in his administration.\n\nThe story of the Trump presidency cannot be fully told in numbers. But here are some numbers illustrate some of the many ways Trump and his administration defied the status quo of the executive branch.\n\nJudicial appointments: Trump was able to successfully appoint three US Supreme Court justices, and he’s surpassed the number of federal judges appointed by George H.W. Bush — the most recent one-term president.\n\nEarlier in 2020, Trump was also on track to appoint more federal appellate judges than any recent president at the same point in his presidency, according to the Pew Research Center. Although Trump served only four years, his changes to the makeup of federal courts will be felt long after he leaves the White House.\n\nExecutive action: As of December 11, 2020, there had been 520 presidential documents signed by Trump — including executive orders, presidential memorandums, determinations and notices — had been published in the Federal Register. Of those, 288 were executive orders and presidential memorandums, not including memos were clerical in nature.\n\nPresidents have increasingly used executive orders and presidential memorandums interchangeably to issue directives to their agencies; they are both legally binding, though executive action can be undone by the next president.\n\nThe increased reliance on such actions has come as an increasingly gridlocked Congress has made it difficult for presidents to act on their agendas.\n\nObama had issued 226 executive orders and memorandums at this point in his tenure in office, while George W. Bush had signed 189.\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump complained about what he saw as Obama’s overuse of executive authority but also suggested that the government could be run like a business.\n\nYet Trump has already exceeded both George W. Bush and Obama in the number of published executive orders and memorandums.\n\nRead about other key figures from his presidency here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign is pursuing a strategy of expanding his appeal by reaching out to audiences beyond friendly conservative media outlets, multiple advisers familiar with the strategy said, including a CNN town hall this week.\n\nThe town hall event in New Hampshire Wednesday evening, Trump’s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 election, joins a list of other signs that Trump is adopting a more traditional campaign in his third run for the White House.\n\nThe former president has surrounded himself with a more organized, experienced team to complement his unconventional campaign style. He’s also scaling back larger rallies, a Trump campaign trademark, for more intimate campaign settings and retail stops that allow the former president to engage with voters.\n\nThat approach speaks to an acknowledgment by the Trump campaign and its allies that the former president must broaden his appeal inside and outside the Republican Party if he is to clinch the GOP nomination and retake the White House in 2024, following his failed reelection bid and disappointing results by Republicans in last year’s midterm elections. The process is being driven by a team of veteran political operatives, skilled in matters such as the delegate process, who believe Trump’s path to victory cannot simply be a reprisal of his insurgent 2016 bid or his large, expensive 2020 operation.\n\nThe former president’s team has increased its outreach with traditional news outlets, taking questions from television and print correspondents on recent campaign swings from organizations Trump has spent years attacking.\n\nTrump’s team also sees the town hall has an opportunity to draw a contrast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has clashed with what he often refers to as “legacy media” organizations.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nWednesday’s live town hall audience will be made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary.\n\nThis is Trump’s third trip to the Granite State since launching his campaign last fall. He handily won the primaries there in 2016 and 2020 before losing the state in both general elections.\n\nNew Hampshire is the second state to vote in the Republican presidential nominating calendar — but after the Iowa caucuses, it’s the first primary to take place.\n\nThe Granite State has long prized its role in vetting presidential contenders, and state law protects that status: Secretary of State David Scanlan is required to set a primary date a week ahead of any other “similar contests” elsewhere on the map. Democrats have reshuffled their primary calendar, leaving some dates in flux, but the GOP has maintained New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status.\n\nThough New Hampshire is among the smallest states in delegate counts, it has a history of propelling primary winners forward toward Super Tuesday with momentum — and winnowing out candidates who fail to gain traction there.\n\nThe winners of the last two competitive New Hampshire Republican presidential primaries, Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 went on to win the party’s nomination.\n\nNew Hampshire’s primary allows “undeclared” voters — those who are not registered as Democrats or Republicans — to choose which primary they participate in. It’s a key voting bloc since about two-in-five New Hampshire voters are undeclared.\n\nThe process has its quirks: Three tiny locations, Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield, vote at midnight and report their tiny numbers of votes immediately. Those vote tallies aren’t large enough sample sizes to be indicative of anything, but they are the only known results for nearly 20 hours, until polls elsewhere close that evening.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, will take questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in a CNN town hall Wednesday as a myriad of legal issues loom over his 2024 White House bid.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins at Saint Anselm College and is Trump’s first appearance on the network since 2016.\n\nTrump is set to face voters as he deals with unprecedented legal clouds hanging over him and as he seeks to become only the second commander-in-chief, ever, elected to two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe town hall comes just a day after a Manhattan federal jury found the former president sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and called the verdict in the civil case a “total disgrace.”\n\nLast month in New York, he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC — where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations — and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.\n\nStill, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts.\n\nThat’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”\n\nWhile a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary, and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid — Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling.\n\nIn a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.\n\nTrump’s participation in the town hall is indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump enters Wednesday’s CNN town hall as both the prohibitive GOP frontrunner for the 2024 nomination and a man just found liable in a civil case for sexually abusing and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump’s large polling advantage was built with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)\n\nThe leads Trump has in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage are some of the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era.\n\nTrump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits.\n\nThere are very few candidates, of either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. Those included Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close.\n\nInterestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that at closer to 30 points, on average.\n\nYou can read more about the polls here.\n\nThe first reaction to Tuesday’s unprecedented verdict finding a former president and current White House candidate liable for sexual abuse offered no reason to suggest that Donald Trump’s position as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination is under any immediate threat.\n\nBut some of his GOP critics raised questions about his fitness for office that are certain to be at the center of the next general election if he is the Republican nominee.\n\nThe unanimous verdict could deepen his vulnerability among key voting groups, including women – among whom the GOP needs to improve to win back the White House.\n\nThe jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.\n\nFor most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents.

He had branded the network ""fake news"" and never granted any of its journalists an interview while president. Trump\'s campaign said he was appearing on the network to step outside of a GOP comfort zone as he already starts to turn his focus to a potential 2024 general election rematch with Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump\'s appearance on CNN comes at a time of jarring dualities for the former president: The Republican is facing a crescendo of legal problems yet seems in a stronger position than ever to become his party\'s presidential nominee, and he\'s attempting to reach mainstream media viewers despite having deepened his embrace of extremists since leaving the White House.\n\nHere\'s what to know about Trump\'s CNN town hall:\n\nQuestions on Sexual Assault\n\nTrump\'s appearance came a day after a New York jury found him liable for sexually abusing a woman nearly 30 years ago and defaming her when she spoke about it publicly.\n\nJurors awarded columnist E. Jean Carroll $5 million in damages. The jury rejected her claim of rape and instead found Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual assault. Trump denied it, saying he never encountered Carroll at a 1996 department store and did not know her and has said he plans to appeal the verdict.\n\nTrump skipped attending the trial and did not testify in his own defense during the proceedings, with jurors instead being shown video from a pretrial deposition, making Wednesday the first time he\'s had to face a public questioning in the case.\n\nTrump, when asked by CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins about the verdict, said his poll numbers went up and repeated his statements that he didn\'t know Carroll, though at least one photograph has surfaced of them together.\n\n""I don\'t know her. I never met her. I had no idea who she is,"" he said.\n\nHe dismissed a question from Collins about whether it would impact his standing with female voters and in response, he launched into a recounting of Carroll\'s claims in a mocking voice, drawing laughs and claps from the live audience. Collins tried to interrupt but Trump continued and called it ""a fake story"" and referred to Carroll as ""a wack job.""\n\nTrump Treatment of Women\n\nCollins asked Trump about his comments in the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" video in which he bragged about grabbing women\'s genitals without asking permission. The video was played in the trial and Collins asked him Wednesday if he stood by his remarks.\n\nTrump defended his comments, saying that he had said women let him grab their genitals without permission because he was a star.\n\n""I can\'t take that back because it happens to be true,"" Trump said.\n\nRepeating Election Lies\n\nTrump, with his first question from Collins about why he should be elected again, started almost immediately by repeating his lies about the 2020 presidential election and repeating his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nStriking a more muted tone than he usually uses on stage before his cheering supporters, Trump called it a ""rigged election"" and a ""shame"" before Collins cut him off, correcting his statements and asking him to publicly acknowledge his loss to Biden.\n\nTrump did not, immediately returning to his claims. As Collins continued to try to fact check Trump, he interrupted again, calling for honest elections and then pivoting to other subjects like immigration.\n\nHe came back to his claims at other points in the town hall, sprinkling the lie into answers on unrelated subjects and prompting Collins to interrupt him and correct him.\n\nDefense of Jan. 6 Insurrection\n\nTrump, after shunning tough questioning for years, returned to a mainstream network for the first time since spreading lies about his 2020 election loss that spurred deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nCollins asked Trump if he regretted his actions on Jan. 6, and the former president quickly began praising the size of the crowd he spoke to that day before some began marching on the Capitol and said the attendees believed the election was ""rigged.""\n\n""They were there proud. They were there with love in their heart. That was unbelievable and it was a beautiful day,"" Trump said.\n\nCollins pressed Trump on why he didn\'t ask his supporters to leave the Capitol or send help to disperse the protesters, and he deflected, trying to cast blame on then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He at one point pulled out printed copies of his Twitter posts that day in which he finally, hours after the attack on the Capitol began, asked his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nFalse Abortion Claims\n\nTrump, responding to a question about the U.S. Supreme Court overturning abortion rights last year, took credit for appointing three of the justices who joined in the majority ruling, saying ""it was such a great victory and people are starting to understand it now.""\n\nHe repeatedly falsely claimed that abortion rights supporters wanted to ""kill a baby"" in the ninth month of pregnancy or even after a birth. The claim is based on a misleading interpretation of a Senate vote. Trump also dodged questions about whether, if elected president again, he would sign a national abortion ban. Trump instead spoke about the court ruling as having given anti-abortion activists ""negotiating ability.""\n\n""What I will do is negotiate so people are happy,"" he said, when asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban. He repeatedly said he would ""do what\'s right,"" without specifying what that was.'}}",100.0,2

But she drew the line at two of McCarthy’s picks: Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who was tapped for the panel’s ranking member slot, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Pelosi maintained that Banks and Jordan were too closely tied to Trump to help carry out a credible investigation.\n\nAfter Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan, McCarthy retracted all five of his nominations, including the three that Pelosi had said she’d accept. ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the unprecedented step of denying the minority party\'s picks for the Select Committee on January 6,"" McCarthy said at the time. ""This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution.""\n\nBut Pelosi had one last move. She proceeded to name the two Republicans who had voted to establish the committee — Cheney and Kinzinger — as members, joining seven Democrats.

(AP)\n\nWhy do critics say the panel is illegitimate?\n\nIn a lawsuit, the Republican National Committee argued that there were several problems with the select committee’s formation.\n\nFirst, rather than 13 members, as set out in the resolution, the panel ended up with only nine. Second, the panel has no ""ranking member,"" as had been called for in the resolution. And third, the Republicans on the committee were not ones recommended by the Republican leader, McCarthy.\n\nOn May 1, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that none of these concerns were enough to stop the committee\'s work. The ruling was made by Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nKelly wrote that concern over the numerical divergence was ""not an unreasonable position,’"" but he added that the court ""must give ‘great weight’ to the House’s own actions,"" including two occasions when House Republicans failed to challenge the committee’s underlying legitimacy before casting votes related to the committee.\n\nThe House has also argued that there’s precedent for a committee with incomplete membership: a 2005 House panel to investigate the government response to Hurricane Katrina consisted of 11 Republicans and zero Democrats. (Ironically, at the time, Pelosi, then the House minority leader, called the panel a ""sham"" and refused to name committee members.)\n\nAs for the question of a ranking member, Kelly concluded that Cheney, as the panel’s vice chair, fulfilled the same function as a ranking member even if her title was different. And on the question of McCarthy’s lack of input, Kelly pointed to the resolution’s requirement that the speaker needed only to engage in ""consultation"" with the minority leader.\n\n""To ‘consult’ with Minority Leader McCarthy, all Speaker Pelosi had to do was ask for his ‘advice or opinion,’"" Kelly wrote. ""There is no dispute that she did. That she did not accept all his recommendations, and that Minority Leader McCarthy then withdrew all his recommendations, does not mean that Speaker Pelosi failed to consult with him.""\n\nAnother broad complaint in the lawsuit is that the committee’s actions are not advancing a valid legislative purpose.\n\nThis argument didn’t fly with Kelly, either, who noted the committee’s purpose was to investigate if legislation is necessary ""to avert a future Jan. 6-style attack."" He reasoned that the committee need not commit to specific legislation in advance of starting its work, since possible legislation could easily emerge once the committee’s efforts were underway.\n\nKelly’s decision was in line with an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In December 2021, a three-judge panel ruled against Trump’s attempts to block the National Archives from turning over presidential correspondence and documents to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nThe appeals judges wrote that there are ""few, if any, more imperative interests squarely within Congress’s wheelhouse than ensuring the safe and uninterrupted conduct of its constitutionally assigned business.""\n\nFurther bolstering the House panel’s case is that a month later, the Supreme Court denied a motion by Trump to overturn the appeals court decision.\n\nThe collective result of these court decisions, Robenalt said, is to show that ""the committee was properly authorized and that Congress has the power to investigate for valid legislative purposes.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2022/the-legitimacy-of-the-jan-6-committee-explained/', 'Headline': 'The legitimacy of the Jan. 6 committee, explained - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Critics argue that the House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, is illegitimate, amounting to a political hit job by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans rather than a sober ...', 'Full_text': 'Critics argue that the House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, is illegitimate, amounting to a political hit job by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans rather than a sober-minded quest to prevent disorder.\n\nThe critics also contend that the process of filling the committee’s seats was partisan, and that, as a result, the committee’s eventual composition is flawed.\n\nDespite the criticism, the committee has withstood legal challenges against it, and experts expect the committee will complete its work.\n\nWhat is the legal justification for committees of this sort?\n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention congressional investigations and oversight, but the courts have consistently upheld Congress’ right to undertake such activities, stemming from the text that says Congress possesses “all legislative powers.” One of the framers of the Constitution, George Mason, said during its drafting that members of Congress “are not only legislators but they possess inquisitorial powers.”\n\nWith the courts’ consistent backing, Congress has undertaken investigations over the past two centuries, from the Teapot Dome corruption scandal in the 1920s to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974.

In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jun/10/house-republicans/fact-checking-whether-bennie-thompson-objected-200/', 'Headline': 'Fact-checking whether Jan. 6 committee chairman Bennie Thompson ...', 'Snippet': 'As the House Jan. 6 Committee was beginning its first prime-time hearing on June 9, the House Republican Conference sought to undercut the legitimacy of the panel and its chair, Rep.

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.\n\nIn a tweet highlighted by four siren emojis, the House Republicans’ official caucus said, ""REMINDER: Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election.""\n\nThompson was a member of the House on Jan. 6, 2005, when a joint session of Congress met to formally count the electoral votes from the 2004 presidential race, in which the incumbent, George W. Bush, defeated his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\nThis is the same task that would be undertaken 16 years later to the day, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol and disrupted the certification of the election — the event that prompted the House select committee’s hearing.\n\nThe 2005 election was close; a shift of 118,601 votes in Ohio from Bush to Kerry would have flipped the state to Kerry and enabled the Democrat to win the Electoral College.\n\nA Democratic House member from Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, offered an objection during the counting of the electoral vote. She was joined in the objection by a member of the Senate, Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., which is enough to trigger a formal vote by each chamber on whether the electoral votes in question were valid. This was the last time an objection vote was held prior to 2021.\n\nThen-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, presents an official objection to the certification of Ohio\'s electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2005. (AP)\n\nThe motion to object said, ""We, a member of the House of Representatives and a United States senator, object to the counting of the electoral votes of the State of Ohio on the ground that they were not, under all of the known circumstances, regularly given.""\n\nThe critics behind the motion had cited a report by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee that had found ""numerous, serious election irregularities,"" particularly in Ohio, that led to ""a significant disenfranchisement of voters.""\n\n""How can we possibly tell millions of Americans who registered to vote, who came to the polls in record numbers, particularly our young people ... to simply get over it and move on?"" Tubbs Jones told reporters, CNN reported.\n\nWhen the House cast its votes, the motion failed by a large margin: Only 31 Democrats voted to object, with 88 Democrats joining all 178 Republicans in opposing the motion.\n\nThompson was one of the 31 Democrats who voted to object, so on this point, the Republicans have a point.\n\nBut that’s not the end of the story.\n\nOne problem is that the wording of the Republicans’ tweet is a bit off-base. Officially, the 31 Democrats did not vote to object to the ""2004 presidential election"" but rather to object to the electoral votes of one state, Ohio.\n\nA more important difference has to do with the context surrounding the vote.\n\nThe 2005 objection was essentially a protest opportunity. Some Democrats were frustrated: It was just four years after the weeks-long Florida recount of 2000, which had resulted in Bush becoming president despite Al Gore’s victory in the popular vote, the first time that had happened in more than a century. This, combined with Kerry’s narrow loss, led some Democrats to publicly vent their frustration with the Electoral College, using the counting of the electoral votes as a forum.\n\nAll parties in 2005 knew that this vote was moot. That’s because two days after the polls had closed in November, Kerry conceded the election to Bush, saying, ""I spoke to President Bush and I offered him and Laura our congratulations on their victory. We had a good conversation, and we talked about the danger of division in our country and the need, the desperate need, for unity, for finding the common ground, coming together. Today I hope that we can begin the healing.""\n\nAnd not long before the counting of the electoral votes, Kerry made clear that he did not support an electoral-vote challenge. ""Our legal teams on the ground have found no evidence that would change the outcome of the election,"" Kerry said in the letter.\n\nThe contrast with the weeks after the election of 2020 were stark. Trump never conceded his election loss. To the contrary, he aggressively pushed a legal battle to overturn the election, offered regular statements that claimed widespread voting fraud, and tried to convince his vice president, Mike Pence, to throw out slates of electoral votes. Pence refused. In the middle of the count of the electoral votes, rioters overran the Capitol building. They finished the job after the building was cleared.\n\nThe bottom line is that the possibility of an impact from electoral vote objections was real in 2021 in a way that it was not in 2005.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, six Republican senators objected to counting the Biden slate for Arizona, joined by 121 Republican House members. A second objection, involving Pennsylvania, drew the support of seven GOP senators and 138 GOP House members.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe House Republican Conference tweeted, ""Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election.""\n\nThompson was one of 31 Democrats who voted to object to Ohio’s slate in 2005, when the electoral votes from the 2004 election were officially counted in a joint session of Congress.\n\nThat said, the 2005 objection had different implications, since Kerry had both conceded the election to Bush and had stated his opposition to the objection effort in Congress. By contrast, the loser in 2020, Trump, was aggressively pursuing a campaign to overturn the election, including by efforts to convince Pence to reject electoral vote slates. As a result, the objections in 2021 could have overturned the presidential election.\n\nWith that clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-report-executive-summary-key-findings-trump/', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 committee ...', 'Snippet': 'House Jan. 6 committee announces it recommends criminal charges against Trump 08:46.

The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/what-the-criminal-referral-of-trump-means-a-constitutional-law-expert-explains-the-jan-6-committee-action-196841', 'Headline': 'What the criminal referral of Trump means - The Conversation', 'Snippet': 'After 18 months investigating, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol held its final public meeting on Dec. 19, 2022.

The panel recommended that the U.S. Department of Justice bring criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe House committee recommended that the Justice Department pursue four main charges against Trump – obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to make a false statement and inciting or assisting an insurrection. The committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee sanction four Republican members of Congress who refused the committee’s subpoena requests to provide information about the events of Jan. 6.\n\nBut what does that all mean? The Conversation asked Margaret Russell, professor of constitutional law at Santa Clara University, to help explain why these recommended charges are important, where they fall short – and what could come next.\n\n1. What are the biggest takeaways from these referrals?\n\nPeople have wondered whether the proceedings would have any strong result. Now it is clear that the committee does not see these proceedings as primarily about making a historical record. They have done more than that.\n\nOne big takeaway is that Trump is at the top of the pile. When the proceedings began it was not clear – though many people suspected and alleged – how much he knew, when he knew it, what he said before Jan. 6, what he knew and said before the election’s certification, and whether he knew he really had not won the election. It is now clear Trump was the architect of most of this conspiracy – and the committee is urging specific accountability for him and other people who played a part in it.\n\nIt is also interesting to think about the committee urging criminal prosecution. It really means it reached the brink. This bipartisan committee, which comprised seven Democrats and two Republicans, decided unanimously that backing away from criminal charges would be a dereliction of its duty to recommend, based on what it has found. Committee members are not telling the Department of Justice what it has to do – they can’t. But in their investigatory role they concluded that in order for there to be accountability, they needed to recommend charges.\n\n2. Do these referrals have any legal teeth?\n\nThe magnitude of these recommended charges, particularly the insurrection one, is unprecedented. Rather than saying they don’t have legal teeth, I think they certainly have very strong teeth in the sense of urging the Department of Justice to make sure that there is accountability. Accountability is a word that jumped out to me in committee members’ statements on Dec. 19 – there must be accountability, even though this committee, of course, cannot force the Department of Justice to do anything.\n\nThe charges, of trying to overthrow the government, essentially, go right to the heart of the Constitution. There is no historical precedent for this. The Justice Department’s determination to pursue the referrals would depend on the validity of the House commitee’s findings. And since the department has been doing its own investigation of Trump, it wouldn’t be starting from ground zero. The committee’s work could be added to what it has.\n\n3. Will the new GOP Congress have any say in these referrals?\n\nNow that the report has been handed over and the referrals made, I would imagine the Department of Justice will start considering it. And, so, when there is a difference in leadership of the House there won’t be any way to undo it. The House can conduct its own investigations, but it cannot stop the Department of Justice and it cannot undo this report and its recommendations. Attorney General Merrick Garland has clearly sent a message that the department he runs is not influenced by outside factors. And he has tried to insulate any prosecutions from accusations of political influence by appointing a special counsel to oversee the Trump investigations.\n\n4. Were lawmakers who ignored the subpoenas legally required to obey the committee’s request for testimony?\n\nI think the answer is yes. The Constitution (Article I, Section 5) states that each chamber makes its own rules that bind its members. The Supreme Court has underscored this constitutional power as well as the legal legitimacy of the congressional subpoena. The consequences of ignoring a congressional subpoena might ultimately wind up within the purview of the Ethics Committee, but there are consequences.\n\n5. Does the House committee’s report increase the likelihood that Trump will be charged?\n\nI think it makes a strong argument in the public sphere for the prosecution of Trump, which is what a lot of people have been waiting for. It doesn’t guarantee a prosecution, but it spells out, I think meticulously, why Trump is included in this and at the forefront.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/trump-letter-january-6-committee-subpoena-fact-check', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Trump responds to Jan. 6 committee subpoena with usual ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump was subpoenaed Thursday by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol..

Bennie Thompson, Trump did not say whether he would comply with the subpoena. Instead, he repeated various long-debunked election claims.\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive fact check of some of Trump’s claims in the letter.\n\nThe legitimacy of the election\n\nTrump’s title on the document was this: “THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020 WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN!”\n\nFacts First: This is false. The 2020 election was not rigged or stolen. Joe Biden was the legitimate winner, Trump the legitimate loser. There is no evidence, in any state, of fraud even close to sufficient to have changed the outcome.\n\nVotes in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump listed purported evidence of wrongdoing in swing states he lost. One of his claims about Pennsylvania, which Biden won by more than 80,000 votes, was this: “In Pennsylvania, as of February 2021, there were 121,240 more votes than voters.”\n\nFacts First: This is false. Pennsylvania did not have more votes cast in the 2020 election than it had registered voters; the state had about 7 million votes cast and about 9 million registered voters, for a turnout of about 76.5%. And Trump was also wrong if he was repeating the claim that the state counted more votes in the 2020 election than it counted voters who participated in that election. This claim, which was based on a Republican state legislator’s misreading of state data that wasn’t complete at the time, was repeatedly debunked in 2020 and 2021.\n\nVotes in Maricopa County, Arizona\n\nTrump made a dramatic claim about Arizona’s most populous county, Maricopa County, where Republicans conducted a sham partisan “audit” of the 2020 election. He wrote: “Maricopa County accepted at least 20,000 mail-in ballots after Election Day 2020, including 18,000 on November 4, 2020, picked up from the U.S. Postal Service—more than the entire Election margin of 10,457 ballots.”\n\nFacts First: This is false. As Reuters has reported, this claim, which has circulated among Trump supporters on social media, is based on a misinterpretation of a document that does not actually show that Maricopa County accepted any ballots after Election Day, let alone thousands of ballots. The document was a receipt for transfer of ballots to a company that scans the ballot envelopes, capturing voters’ signatures, as part of the process of the county verifying the signatures.\n\nRunbeck chief executive Jeff Ellington told Reuters in June: “These 18,000 ballots were received on Election Day prior to the deadline to cast a vote and delivered to Runbeck the next day for processing, following our standard operating procedure.”\n\nAntrim County, Michigan\n\nTrump returned to a favorite conspiracy theory about a particular county in Michigan, another swing state he lost to Biden. After claiming that one of his allies, Republican attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno, “found voting machines were subverted and accessed remotely,” Trump continued: “In Antrim County, 7,048 votes were changed in favor of Joe Biden.”\n\nFacts First: No votes were changed in Antrim County because of voting machines being subverted, and there is no evidence of any intentional wrongdoing of any kind in the county. Rather, the conservative county made a human error in readying its election technology. The error resulted in some votes for Trump being initially reported as votes for Biden in unofficial preliminary results. The error was rapidly corrected, long before any results were made official, and a Republican-led investigation of the 2020 election by a Michigan state Senate committee concluded that “that ideas and speculation that the Antrim County election workers or outside entities manipulated the vote by hand or electronically are indefensible.”\n\nAs for DePerno’s efforts to prove something nefarious happened in Antrim County, the committee also wrote this in its section on the Antrim County situation: “The Committee closely followed Mr. DePerno’s efforts and can confidently conclude they are demonstrably false and based on misleading information and illogical conclusions.” DePerno and others are now under investigation by a special prosecutor over their own alleged efforts to gain access to election technology after the election; DePerno has denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the accusations are politically motivated.\n\nFulton County, Georgia\n\nTrump insinuated, as he has before, that he lost Georgia in part because of nefarious doings in Fulton County, home to Atlanta. He wrote that an investigator reported 1,200 ballots being “‘wheeled in through the back door’ days after Election Day, when President Trump’s massive lead ‘shrunk as more votes continue to be tallied in Fulton County.’”\n\nFacts First: This is deceptive. The independent monitor who was hired by the state election board to observe the election in Fulton County did not report any sign that these ballots were fraudulent; in fact, he wrote in his report that “at no time did I ever observe any conduct by Fulton County election officials that involved dishonesty, fraud, or intentional malfeasance,” though he did find sloppiness and other issues. Rather, he simply wrote that, although “it was a judgment call,” he thought the “optics” of bringing ballots through a back door two days after Election Day were poor and that this was “the wrong call for transparency purposes.”\n\nAlso, contrary to the impression Trump left here, the monitor did not connect this particular group of ballots to Trump’s illusory lead in Georgia shrinking. The words “shrunk as more votes continue to be tallied in Fulton County” appear to be a quote from CNN – which explicitly pointed out at the time that Trump’s shrinking lead wasn’t the result of anything nefarious – and not the monitor himself.\n\nThis story has been updated.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/12/the-facts-underpinning-jan-6-committee-criminal-referrals/', 'Headline': 'The Facts Underpinning Jan. 6 Committee Criminal Referrals', 'Snippet': 'The evidence the committee cites includes a memo Eastman wrote that lays out six steps for enabling Pence to declare Trump the winner of the 2020 election on Jan. 6.

Those referrals will be passed along to Jack Smith, an independent special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to look into criminal accusations against Trump.\n\nThe Department of Justice is under no obligation to consider a criminal prosecution based on the referrals. The New York Times said it “remains unclear just how closely the special counsel’s office in charge of the Justice Department’s own investigation will follow the path mapped out by the committee — or whether Mr. Trump and others will face any criminal charges at all.”\n\nNonetheless, no former president has ever faced a criminal referral from Congress. Here we will outline the four criminal referrals brought by the committee, and the evidence it cites to back them up.\n\nObstruction of an Official Proceeding\n\nThe first criminal referral from the committee alleges Trump violated Section 1512(c)(2) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which relates to someone who “corruptly … obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.” In this case, the official proceeding was Congress’ joint session to count electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021. The penalty for violating the statute is a fine and/or imprisonment of up to 20 years.\n\nThe Constitution stipulates that after state electors have certified and sent their sealed votes for president and vice president to the president of the Senate (which is the vice president), he “shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.” U.S. law says this will occur on Jan. 6.\n\nThe committee says Trump sought to “prevent or delay the counting of lawful certified Electoral College votes from multiple States,” by personally and repeatedly pushing then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes — even after Pence, his counsel Greg Jacob and others told the president that Pence did not have the authority to do that.\n\nAccording to the committee report, even Trump’s lawyer John Eastman “admitted” that Trump had been advised that the vice president did not have the unilateral power to refuse to count votes under the Electoral College Act, but Trump “continued to pressure the Vice President to act illegally.”\n\n“[Y]ou know him [Trump] – once he gets something in his head, it is hard to get him to change course,” Eastman wrote in an email to Jacob.\n\nThe report cites as evidence Trump’s further efforts to overturn the election, including soliciting state legislatures and state officials to “alter official electoral outcomes.” For example, the report cites notes from Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue of a call from Trump on Dec. 27, 2020, in which the president made a request that Donoghue and Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen “just say that the election was was [sic] corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R[epublican] Congressmen” — even after the two Justice officials had just told the president that his various claims about voter fraud “were simply not true,” according to Donoghue.\n\nThe report also details Trump’s efforts to install Jeffrey Clark as head of the Department of Justice, because Clark would — in the words of Republican Rep. Scott Perry — “do something about” the allegations of voter fraud. Indeed, Clark had penned a letter on Dec. 28, 2020, to the state Legislature of Georgia claiming — falsely — that the Department of Justice had “identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia,” and calling on the state Legislature to “convene in special session” to evaluate election fraud. The letter, which was never sent, says there were two sets of electors sent to Washington, one set supporting Biden, the other Trump.\n\nAccording to the committee report, this was all part of Trump’s plan to use the Department of Justice to overturn the election outcome in Georgia and other swing states won by Biden.\n\nAfter both Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign the letter, Trump then offered Clark the job of acting attorney general. It was only after Trump was informed that the Justice Department’s leadership — hundreds of people — would resign if that happened that Trump backed off.\n\n“Faced with mass resignations and recognizing that the ‘breakage’ could be too severe, Donald Trump decided to rescind his offer to Clark and drop his plans to use the Justice Department to aid in his efforts to overturn the election outcome,” the report states. “The President looked at Clark and said, ‘I appreciate your willingness to do it. I appreciate you being willing to suffer the abuse. But the reality is, you’re not going to get anything done. These guys are going to quit. Everyone else is going to resign. It’s going to be a disaster,'” according to a committee interview with Donoghue.\n\nFinally, the report alleges that Trump was “responsible for recruiting tens of thousands of his supporters to Washington for January 6th, and knowing they were angry and some were armed, instructing them to march to the Capitol and ‘fight like hell.'”\n\nThe report notes that amid the rioting at the Capitol, Trump “refused for multiple hours to take the single step his advisors and supporters were begging him to take to halt the violence: to make a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol.”\n\n“Through action and inaction, President Trump corruptly obstructed, delayed and impeded the vote count,” the summary report states.\n\nConspiracy to Defraud the United States\n\nThe committee voted to make a criminal referral against Trump for violating Section 371 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which makes it a crime to “conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States.” A conviction of this statute carries a penalty of a fine and/or no more than five years in prison.\n\nIn laying out the case against Trump and his alleged co-conspirators, the report says the evidence for this crime “overlaps greatly” with the evidence for “obstruction of an official proceeding.”\n\nThe report lists three reasons for this criminal referral:\n\nTrump “entered into an agreement with individuals to obstruct a lawful function of the government (the certification of the election).”\n\nTrump and his co-conspirators “used ‘deceitful or dishonest means’” in their attempts to block the certification of the election. (In prosecuting criminal conspiracy cases, the Department of Justice has said that prosecutors must prove criminal intent, noting that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit “requires a finding the defendant acted ‘by deceitful and dishonest means.’”)\n\n“[T]here were numerous overt acts in furtherance of the agreement, including each of the parts of the President’s effort to overturn the election.”\n\nThe report mentions several co-conspirators, but says “Jeffrey Clark stands out as a participant in the conspiracy.” The report cites evidence that suggests “Clark entered into an agreement with President Trump that if appointed Acting Attorney General, he would send a letter to State officials falsely stating that the Department of Justice believed that State legislatures had a sufficient factual basis to convene to select new electors.” (For more, see our section above on the obstruction referral.)\n\nA few other lawyers were mentioned in the report as co-conspirators, including Kenneth Chesebro, who was described as “a central player in the scheme to submit fake electors to the Congress and the National Archives.” The fake electors were part of an illegal “plot to get the Vice President to unilaterally prevent certification of the election.”\n\nAs we write in the section on the obstruction referral, Trump backed down from appointing Clark acting attorney general when faced with mass resignations in the Justice Department. But Trump continued to pressure Pence to reject electoral votes from swing states that Biden narrowly won.\n\n“All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the States to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people,” Trump falsely said at the Jan. 6, 2021, rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThat same day, Trump urged Pence twice on Twitter to reject enough of Biden’s electoral votes to deny Biden the presidency. “All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN,” Trump tweeted. “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!”\n\nTrump pressured Pence to act, even though he was also told by Eastman and others that “the plot to get the Vice President to unilaterally prevent certification of the election was manifestly (and admittedly) illegal,” the report says.\n\nThe report argues that the fake elector plan — and other “overt acts” taken to defraud the U.S. — show Trump’s criminal intent.\n\n(In another example of such an overt act, the report says Trump “repeatedly lied about the election, after he had been told by his advisors that there was no evidence of fraud sufficient to change the results of the election.” For more, see our story “Trump Ignored Aides, Repeated False Fraud Claims.”)\n\nIn support of its criminal referrals against Trump, the committee report quotes Federal District Court Judge David Carter, who has ruled that some of Eastman’s emails regarding his legal work for Trump were not protected by attorney-client privilege under the “crime-fraud exception” and must be turned over to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nIn a ruling issued on Oct. 19, Carter wrote: “As to the first prong of the crime fraud exception, the Court has previously determined that President Trump was more likely than not engaged in or planning an obstruction of an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2), and a conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, when he sought the advice of Dr. Eastman.”\n\nConspiracy to Make a False Statement\n\nThe committee says that Trump violated Section 1001 of Title 18, which concerns making false statements in matters involving the federal government and carries a penalty of a fine and up to five years in prison, along with Section 371, the conspiracy statute for any offense against the government.\n\nThis referral is about Trump conspiring with others “to submit slates of fake electors to Congress and the National Archives,” the committee’s summary says.\n\nSection 1001 makes it a crime for anyone who, “in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully — (1)falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2)makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3)makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.”\n\nIn seven states, Republican electors signed certifications that falsely said Trump had won those states — these are the false statements at issue here — and, the committee charges, Trump used those slates of fake electors in claiming that Pence could decline to certify the official Biden electors on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“The evidence is clear that President Trump personally participated in a scheme to have the Trump electors meet, cast votes, and send their votes to the Joint Session of Congress in several States that Vice President Biden won, and then his supporters relied on the existence of these fake electors as part of their effort to obstruct the Joint Session,” the committee says.\n\nThe slates of false electors were created in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — all states that Biden won — on Dec. 14, the same day the actual, certified electors in those states officially cast their Electoral College votes for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The National Archives has posted the “unofficial” Republican certificates it received from the false electors on its website.\n\nThe committee charges that Trump’s co-conspirators were his attorneys Eastman and Chesebro. The evidence the committee cites includes a memo Eastman wrote that lays out six steps for enabling Pence to declare Trump the winner of the 2020 election on Jan. 6. The memo begins with the statement: “7 states have transmitted dual slates of electors to the President of the Senate,” and the plan Eastman describes relies on those false Republican electors. It says that on Jan. 6, Pence would skip counting electoral votes from states for which he had multiple slates of electors.\n\n“At the end, he [Pence] announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States,” the Eastman memo says, adding that without those seven states, Trump would have more electoral votes than Biden and would be reelected.\n\nAnother piece of evidence is that Trump and Eastman asked the Republican National Committee in a teleconference to spearhead the effort to get Trump electors to cast votes in several states, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told the committee, according to the report. McDaniel agreed to do that.\n\nThe committee quotes several Trump campaign officials criticizing or questioning the plan to create the false slates of electors. For instance, Matthew Morgan, the Trump campaign’s general counsel, told the committee “the [fake] electors were, for lack of a better way of saying it, no good or not — not valid” without a state’s certificate of ascertainment.\n\nThe committee cites other “contemporaneous documents” that it says show Trump and allies, including Chesebro, wanted Pence to “rely upon these false slates of electors on January 6th to justify refusing to count genuine electoral votes.”\n\n“The fake electors followed Chesebro’s step-by-step instructions for completing and mailing the fake certificates to multiple officials in the U.S. Government,” the committee says.\n\nSome of the fake electors told the committee “they felt misled or betrayed” and wouldn’t have signed the fake certificates “had they known that the fake votes would be used on January 6th without an intervening court ruling.”\n\n“[T]he evidence indicates that he [Trump] entered into an agreement with Eastman and others to make the false statement (the fake electoral certificates), by deceitful or dishonest means, and at least one member of the conspiracy engaged in at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy (e.g. President Trump and Eastman’s call to Ronna McDaniel),” the committee’s summary says.\n\n‘Incite,’ ‘Assist’ or ‘Aid and Comfort’ an Insurrection\n\nCommittee members allege that available evidence shows that Trump violated 18 U.S.C. 2383, which applies when a person “incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto.” A violation is punishable by a fine, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both — as well as a prohibition from holding public office.\n\nThe committee faults Trump for “summoning what became a violent mob” and then “urging them to march to the Capitol.” The committee also says that Trump provoked the crowd with his remarks and tweets on that day.\n\nThe committee argues that Trump’s Jan. 6 speech — in which he said “if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election” — “created a desperate and false expectation in President Trump’s mob that ended up putting the Vice President and his entourage and many others at the Capitol in physical danger.”\n\nThe committee claims Trump further “inflamed and exacerbated the mob violence” when he sent a tweet later that day saying that Pence, who could not legally stop the election certification, “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”\n\n“The President threw gasoline on the fire despite knowing that there was a violent riot underway at the Capitol,” the report says.\n\nThe committee also says that it has evidence, including testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, that Trump resisted speaking out against the violence or instructing the crowd of Trump supporters to leave the Capitol “despite repeated pleas” from his family, his staff and members of Congress. Trump did not want to secure the Capitol during the attack, the committee claims, saying in a footnote that “evidence suggests that the Vice President and certain members of President Trump’s staff urged [the Department of Defense] to deploy the National Guard notwithstanding the President’s wishes.”\n\nAs another example, the committee quotes former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who testified that former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Cipollone that Trump “doesn’t want to do anything” to stop the violence.\n\nIn addition, the committee says that several people charged with participating in the Capitol riot have indicated in their own defense that they were doing what they believed Trump wanted them to do. And the committee notes that Trump said in a Sept. 1 interview that, if he is reelected president, he would consider issuing full pardons and an apology to “many” who participated in the attack that day.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/23268754/january-6-committee-trump-liz-cheney', 'Headline': 'The January 6 committee, explained - Vox', 'Snippet': 'The committee devoted a hearing in late June solely to Hutchinson, a previously obscure figure, which featured testimony about Trump’s desire to go to the Capitol on January 6 and about members ...', 'Full_text': 'The House January 6 committee’s primetime hearing Thursday represented the culmination of the series of eight hearings that stretched across the better part of the summer. This latest hearing filled in many of the gaps in what we know about then-President Donald Trump’s role in encouraging the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nAnd there will be more for the public to see. The committee’s chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), announced another round of hearings in September.\n\n“Doors have opened, new subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break,” vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) said Thursday.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s plenty to unpack from what we’ve learned so far. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n1) What is the point of the January 6 committee?\n\nAlthough the events of January 6 were amply covered at the time and have since been the topic of books, documentaries, and a presidential impeachment trial, there have been countless questions about the attack on the US Capitol left unanswered. Was it planned or organized in any way? And, if so, by whom? What was Donald Trump doing while his supporters ransacked the Capitol? And how did it fit into Trump’s months-long effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and keep himself in office? These questions were left lingering even after Trump was impeached for inciting the attack, and have never fully been answered.\n\nThe January 6 committee was created by Congress to investigate the circumstances around the attack on the Capitol, to recommend “changes in law, policy, procedures, rules, or regulations” to prevent future acts of violence, and “to strengthen the security and resilience of the United States and American democratic institutions.” It was created with a near party-line vote in June 2021, with only the two Republicans who ended up on the committee, Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), voting for it.\n\nThe final work product of the committee is not the televised hearings, or punishing anyone for wrongdoing it uncovers, but instead a formal report to Congress. That’s expected to be issued in the fall; it is anticipated to explain how the attack on the Capitol happened and outline future steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\n\n2) So what has it been doing so far?\n\nWith its broad mandate, the committee has interviewed over 1,000 witnesses and focused intensively on the actions of Donald Trump in the weeks and months before the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\nThe committee worked for months before it started making its case to the public, though much of what it found out behind closed doors was revealed in press reports. Those leaks of committee findings included reports about a draft executive order prepared for Trump to have the military seize voting machines, text messages sent by former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows urging members of Congress to act to overturn the election, and correspondence between Trump adviser John Eastman and Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nSince June, the committee has held eight public hearings geared at assembling a cohesive, comprehensive story of the organized, multi-pronged effort to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, with Trump at its center. So far, the hearings have focused on aspects of that plan, like:\n\nAttempts by Trump to pressure Republican state officials to try to reverse Joe Biden’s wins in several swing states.\n\nThe effort to push Vice President Mike Pence into unilaterally and unconstitutionally throwing out electoral votes in his role presiding over the formal certification of the 2020 election.\n\nThe effort to force Justice Department officials to take legal actions seeking a different election result in court.\n\nWhat happened when all of those failed, and Trump then focused on his rally on January 6 to try to bring his supporters to Washington, DC, in a last-ditch effort to hold on to power.\n\nUnlike other congressional hearings that feature lengthy opening statements and ample speechifying, these have run more like scripted television programs. The committee has even used a former television news executive as a consultant, and that shows in the polished production: It weaves together clips of videotaped depositions and occasionally alternates those with live questioning of the witnesses before the committee.\n\n3) Could the committee’s work result in actual consequences for Trump or anyone else?\n\nYes, it could.\n\nThe committee doesn’t have the authority to punish anyone. Much has been made about whether it might issue criminal referrals to ask the Justice Department to indict Trump or others involved in efforts to overturn the election. These, however, don’t carry any real legal weight. One could tag Attorney General Merrick Garland on a tweet asking him to indict Trump and it would have much the same independent effect.\n\nBut the resources the committee has put toward investigating January 6 have produced evidence that could eventually be shared with the Justice Department to buttress its investigation.\n\nPerhaps the most meaningful legal impact of the committee’s investigation so far came in a 44-page ruling from David Carter, a federal judge in California. In the ruling, Carter held that documents the committee subpoenaed from John Eastman, an outside Trump lawyer, were not protected by attorney-client privilege. This was because, he wrote, Eastman and Trump were acting as criminal co-conspirators trying to mount “a coup in search of a legal theory.” In stark language, Carter wrote, “the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021” and “that President Trump and Dr. Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean Trump will get prosecuted. After all, the decision whether to charge Trump, Eastman, or anyone else with a crime doesn’t rest with a federal judge but with prosecutors. But it does come freighted with significance that a nonpartisan actor issued a formal legal ruling saying it is more likely than not that a sitting president committed a crime.\n\n4) What does this have to do with the Justice Department investigation?\n\nYou could view the committee’s investigation of January 6 and the DOJ’s investigations as two trains running on parallel tracks, investigating the same thing in different ways. The committee has moved from closed-door interviews to televised hearings while the Justice Department has been steadily prosecuting those who entered the Capitol grounds on January 6. As of early July, 855 people had been arrested across the country. About 330 have pleaded guilty to various charges, while 10 have gone to trial and been found guilty.\n\nRecently, however, the DOJ has stepped up its efforts, raiding and seizing electronic devices of figures like Eastman as well as of those who were involved in schemes around the electoral vote-counting process. It is unclear exactly what connection this new push by the DOJ has to the committee’s work.\n\nEventually, the two tracks will converge once the committee issues its report and turns over its investigative material to the Department of Justice. The question then is simply what Garland will do with the evidence the committee has gathered as well as that gathered by his own prosecutors.\n\nThe final decision to prosecute Trump and his associates will fall into Garland’s lap. The attorney general will have to weigh not only the strength of evidence and the likelihood that a jury would convict, but also whether to set the precedent of indicting a former president, which would be a first in American history.\n\n5) Who are the participants I need to know about?\n\nThe two bold-faced names running the committee are its chair, Bennie Thompson, and its vice chair, Liz Cheney. These are the only two members of the committee who speak at every hearing. Cheney has often played an active role in hearings; her opening and closing statements provide a road map for what the committee intends to do and hints of new revelations to come.\n\nThe other person who has come to national prominence through the hearings is Cassidy Hutchinson, a now-26-year-old former White House aide. The committee devoted a hearing in late June solely to Hutchinson, a previously obscure figure, which featured testimony about Trump’s desire to go to the Capitol on January 6 and about members of Congress who allegedly sought presidential pardons for their own efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nHutchinson was the first White House aide to testify in person before the committee and willingly provide revelatory testimony. Two more appeared at the committee’s July 21 hearing, former deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger and former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews. Both Matthews and Pottinger resigned from the Trump administration immediately after the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThere have been plenty of other Trump White House aides who have appeared via their videotaped depositions and made memorable contributions, including White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and former Attorney General Bill Barr. Most recently, White House counsel Pat Cipollone finally testified before the committee. Others in Trump’s orbit have appeared in person for hearings, including former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Greg Jacob, the counsel for Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n6) And what’s going on with people like Steve Bannon who weren’t cooperating?\n\nWhile many big names in Trumpworld have cooperated and the committee has played clips of depositions from top Trump allies including his daughter Ivanka Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his former campaign manager Bill Stepien, several well-known figures in Trump’s orbit have refused to do so.\n\nThe most well-known is Steve Bannon, the former top White House strategist who has since been an outside adviser to Trump. Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress in July for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the committee. This made him the first person to suffer direct legal consequences from the committee’s work. Bannon faces up to a year in jail at his October 21 sentencing, barring an appeal.\n\nThe committee has referred three others for contempt of Congress after votes in the House. The Department of Justice declined to move forward with prosecutions of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Dan Scavino, but has charged Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro with contempt.\n\nOthers appeared before the committee but repeatedly invoked their constitutional right against self-incrimination, including former national security adviser Mike Flynn and former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark.\n\n7) Is this breaking through or having a political impact?\n\nThe committee is piling up plenty of evidence that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election and then actively conspired to overturn it. Of course, there have been plenty of instances of his misdeeds in the past — dozens of scandals, two impeachments, and an almost infinite number of problematic tweets — yet he’s weathered those and managed to stay the leader of the Republican Party. It’s hard to imagine that anything will ever shatter Trump’s grip over his MAGA base, and this probably won’t do it.\n\nBut there is some evidence that the hearings are eroding his general standing within the GOP; reaching some Republicans who were never part of the MAGA wing of the party and reminding them of their horror over the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAccording to a late June poll from CBS/YouGov, a quarter of Trump voters say they are paying some or a lot of attention to the hearings, while over 40 percent of Trump voters think it is very important or somewhat important to find out what happened that day. Further, Trump’s unfavorability has steadily increased in polling over the past month, while the former president has started to slip under 50 percent in polls for the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nThis is happening while Trump is sounding like a presidential candidate in all but name. Just last week, in an interview with New York magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi, he implied the only open question is whether he would announce his candidacy before or after the November midterms. While Trump still has a strong core of support within the GOP in a potential primary, he has already lost one presidential election to Biden, and lagged the incumbent in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll even though only a third of voters in the same poll approved of Biden’s performance in office. Anything that further dings Trump’s support — even outside the base — is a political liability.\n\n8) Is this like anything that has happened before?\n\nWhile the January 6 committee has often been compared to Watergate, it has very little in common with the carefully crafted Senate committee that investigated the Watergate break-in, led by conservative Democrat Sam Ervin in 1973, an era when politics was more genteel and most Americans received their news through traditional media outlets.\n\nThe most unusual aspect of the committee is its non-adversarial nature. After a fight over Republican nominees to the committee led House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to refuse to participate, it left the committee without any Trump defenders.\n\nCheney and Kinzinger, the two Republicans on the committee, both voted to impeach Trump, and that has led to the members working together in a nonpartisan way. The resulting unity of purpose has enabled the hearings to become slick televised productions without any objections, obstruction, or grandstanding. While the decision to refuse to participate was initially made in an effort to delegitimize the committee and make it look like a partisan vehicle after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked two of McCarthy’s original nominees from joining the committee, Republicans have since been left regretting the decision. Even Trump has criticized it after the hearings began when he was left without any allies in the room.\n\nThe question is what outcomes will result from the committee. The Watergate scandal led to the passage of comprehensive campaign finance laws for the first time in American history (although much of the regime was promptly ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and has been steadily eroded by court decisions since then).\n\nWhile reform of the Electoral Count Act, the arcane 19th-century law that governs the certification of presidential elections, has had bipartisan support in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, it’s unlikely that there will be more significant legislative proposals. There may still be prosecutions of those involved in the effort to overturn the election, but the question is whether it will reach the scale of Watergate, which led to nearly 50 guilty verdicts.\n\nThere also is the specter of Trump or another MAGA candidate winning the White House in 2024 and potentially pardoning anyone prosecuted (including the hundreds already found guilty of breaching the Capitol). Trump has already expressed at rallies his willingness to do this. There is precedent for this — most of the top government officials wrapped up in the Iran-Contra scandal were pardoned by George H.W. Bush before he left office in 1993.\n\n9) What happens next?\n\nThe committee will continue its investigative process, and hold more hearings in September. It must also draft and write a final report, which is expected to be complete in the fall. At that point, it will make public whatever recommendations it has and perhaps hold another hearing to present them.\n\nThe hard deadline for action, though, is the midterms. Not only are Democrats expected to lose control of the House, but two of the committee’s members, Kinzinger and Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), are not running for reelection, while two others face tough races. Cheney is the underdog in her August primary while Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA) represents a swing district. The result is that the committee has to accomplish all of its goals by the end of the year.\n\nWith Democrats likely to lose the House and Republicans already pledging retribution over the committee’s work, it’s unlikely that anything proposed by the committee would stand a chance of passing the House in 2023.\n\nAs for Trump and his allies, the Department of Justice eventually has to decide whether to take the unprecedented step of indicting a former president. And if it doesn’t do so soon, the decision may be about indicting not just a former president but a current presidential candidate as well.\n\nUpdate, July 25, 12:55 pm ET: This story was updated with new information including new hearings planned for September, and Steve Bannon’s conviction.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/targeting-trump-for-prosecution-4-essential-reads-on-how-the-jan-6-investigation-laid-the-groundwork-for-the-special-counsel-210026', 'Headline': 'Targeting Trump for prosecution – 4 essential reads on how the Jan. 6 ...', 'Snippet': 'Before there was Jack Smith, there was the House January 6 committee. Its work and findings may provide a hint about what new charges Smith might lodge against former President Donald Trump.', 'Full_text': 'With the news on July 18, 2023, that Special Counsel Jack Smith had informed former President Donald Trump that he was a target of the federal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the related Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, speculation began immediately among political analysts and pundits about what charges the former president might face.\n\nBut criminal investigations are not public, so drawing conclusions about what charges Smith might bring would have to rely on indications from other sources.\n\nOne place to find some possible hints: Smith’s investigation into Trump came on the heels of the sprawling public investigation of the Capitol insurrection by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack, known colloquially as the House January 6 committee.\n\nThe committee interviewed 1,200 people, including former Trump staff, state election officials and people who had participated in the Jan. 6 attack. Its final report was 845 pages long and provided many previously unknown facts and details about what happened on Jan. 6 and in the days and weeks leading up to it. The committee recommended Trump be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to make a false statement and aiding an insurrection.\n\nHere are four of The Conversation’s stories about the committee’s work to help you understand what it did, what it found and how its work may fit into what could be yet another historic prosecution of a former U.S. president. Three of the four were written by Claire Leavitt, a Smith College scholar of congressional oversight whose analyses are grounded in real-world experience: She spent a year working on the Democratic majority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n\n1. What’s an investigation and what’s a hearing?\n\nAs the committee prepared for its first public hearing, Leavitt laid out its two-pronged functions: investigation first, public hearings second.\n\n“Blockbuster hearings are fascinating and even fun,” wrote Leavitt. “They dominate the political and cultural conversation and prompt movie stars to show up in ‘Saturday Night Live’ cold opens. But what do they actually accomplish?”\n\nSuch high-profile hearings, wrote Leavitt, actually represent the end of the investigative process. They “tend to be choreographed affairs, presenting a tightly woven narrative to the public. By now, most of the investigative work has already been done.”\n\nHearings “establish a shared foundation of facts that can inform short- and long-term debates – around the dinner table, in the media, in Congress and among scholars – over how major events should be interpreted,” wrote Leavitt. And they can also serve as a “a kind of preemptive justification for specific legal and legislative actions that may follow the investigation.”\n\nFor example, Leavitt wrote, “if the committee does end up recommending criminal charges against Trump and his allies, the hearings have already explained the legitimacy of these charges to the public.”\n\nRead more: How a public hearing is different from an investigation – and what that means for the Jan. 6 committee\n\n2. Historic event given time-tested congressional scrutiny\n\nLeavitt also set the January 6 committee’s work – really, its very existence – in historical context. For all the complaints by Trump and his allies that the investigation was illegitimate and a “witch hunt,” Leavitt wrote that the committee’s work fit squarely into the U.S. democratic tradition.\n\n“The committee’s recommendation to prosecute a former president was unprecedented. But its investigation of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, fell squarely within Congress’ power and added a new chapter to a centurieslong history of congressional investigations into government scandals and failures,” she wrote.\n\nCongress has the power to investigate. “Its standing and special committees,” wrote Leavitt, “known as select committees, regularly conduct both preemptive oversight and retroactive investigations. Their aim: to identify specific cases of wrongdoing both inside and outside government.”\n\nAnd it’s the committee’s identification of wrongdoing that could have provided fodder for Jack Smith’s investigation of Trump.\n\nRead more: Jan. 6 committee tackled unprecedented attack with time-tested inquiry\n\n3. Legitimizing the drive for accountability\n\nDid the January 6 committee pave the way for Jack Smith to charge Trump in connection with the events to overturn the election?\n\nWith its decision to recommend charges against Trump, the January 6 committee members, wrote Santa Clara University legal scholar Margaret Russell, had “reached the brink. This bipartisan committee, which comprised seven Democrats and two Republicans, decided unanimously that backing away from criminal charges would be a dereliction of its duty to recommend, based on what it has found.”\n\nThe magnitude of the charges the committee recommended, “particularly the insurrection one, is unprecedented,” wrote Russell.\n\nAnd while the committee itself could not force charges to be brought, Russell said their recommendation had “very strong teeth in the sense of urging the Department of Justice to make sure that there is accountability.”\n\nRead more: What the criminal referral of Trump means – a constitutional law expert explains the Jan. 6 committee action\n\n4. History takes time\n\nRegardless of whether the House January 6 committee’s work contributed to Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation, its work should be seen as historic, wrote Leavitt. But that will take time to become clear.\n\n“Assessing the full impact of the investigation requires patience – probably decades’ worth,” Leavitt wrote.\n\n“The process by which events become part of the public consciousness is slow and often imperceptible, but it is a legacy arguably as important as the discrete electoral or policy outcomes that emerge – or not – in the short term.”'}}",97.8125,2

There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-accuses-matt-gaetz-leaving-republicans-weakened-1833061', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene Accuses Matt Gaetz of Leaving Republicans ...', 'Snippet': 'Rep.

Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has ""not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.""\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or ""coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies"" and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nRead more: After third venue cancels, Gaetz, Greene take \'protest against communism\' to Riverside\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue\'s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers ""are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.""\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue\'s conditional use permit would be ""in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.""\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a ""peaceful protest against communism"" outside Riverside City Hall.\n\n“These folks they tried to cancel our venues but they can never cancel our patriotism or our American spirit,” Gaetz said in a video filmed outside Riverside City Hall. “They’ll hear us all throughout Southern California.”\n\nSign up for Essential California, your daily guide to news, views and life in the Golden State.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-fights-impeachment-credit-1826462', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene Fights for Impeachment Credit', 'Snippet': 'Representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene speak at a rally on May 27, 2021, in Dalton, Georgia.

Greene and Gaetz, widely viewed as two of the most far-right members of Congress, have shown sympathy for many of the rioters and have attempted to visit the D.C. jail where some riot defendants are being held, to inspect conditions at the facility. Gaetz notably spread a conspiracy theory on the House floor just hours after the attack, claiming that some of the rioters may have been “antifa terrorists.” Greene, meanwhile, has recently compared the riot at the Capitol to the Declaration of Independence, saying it was an attempt to “overthrow tyrants.”\n\nTangent\n\nAs time passes, right-wing condemnation of the attack has gradually been replaced by conspiracy theories. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News prime-time host who anchors the most popular show on cable news, released a three-part series in October called “Patriot Purge.” The series repeated the baseless claim that the January 6 attack was a “false flag” operation actually orchestrated by the government—a notion that has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Calls Off Press Conference On Capitol Attack Anniversary (Forbes)'}}",97.5,2

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters clash with police and security forces at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ... that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'Chilling Footage Shows Congressional Leaders on Jan. 6.

Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.', 'Full_text': 'A fraud. A villain.\n\nIn his June 3 Facebook post, that’s how conservative activist Benny Johnson described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack. The footage does not prove the attack was scripted or planned, and we found no credible evidence to support that claim.\n\nThe attack was real; it caused millions of dollars in damage and prompted hundreds of arrests.\n\nWe rate these claims False.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-nancy-pelosi-january-6-trump-pelosis-power-documentary/', 'Headline': 'How Nancy Pelosi Responded as Jan. 6 and Its Aftermath Unfolded - PBS', 'Snippet': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets. In scenes ...', 'Full_text': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets.\n\nIn scenes from Pelosi’s Power, the first documentary on the life and legacy of the first woman speaker of the House, rioters chant Pelosi’s name as they move through the Capitol building. Footage captures them shouting, “Where are you, Nancy? We’re looking for you,” and “Yeah, we’re coming, bitch,” before entering her office.\n\nSusan Page, author of the Pelosi biography Madam Speaker, later asked Pelosi if she’d been afraid.\n\n“Nancy said that they would’ve had a fight on their hands. They would’ve had a battle on their hands, because she’s a street fighter,” Page tells FRONTLINE in the opening moments of Pelosi’s Power, embedded above. “And then she lifts up her foot. And, you know, she always wears those 4-inch stiletto heels. And she points at her shoe and says, ‘Besides, I could’ve used these as weapons.’”\n\nIn the hours and days to come, Pelosi would fight — not against the rioters but against the leader who had fueled the insurrection through false claims about a stolen election.\n\n“She really saw [then-President Donald Trump] as so reckless and dangerous,” says Molly Ball, author of Pelosi and a reporter on the new FRONTLINE documentary. “It was such a white-knuckle moment that, whatever the rules said, you just had to hold down the fort and make sure that things didn’t get further out of hand.”\n\nOn Jan. 7, as the above excerpt recounts, Pelosi called the Pentagon’s top general, Mark Milley, and asked about safeguards to prevent “an unstable president” from initiating any rash actions. Then Pelosi went to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and with him called Vice President Mike Pence, another target of the mob, to ask Pence to invoke the 25th amendment. When Pence didn’t take the call, Pelosi moved toward impeachment.\n\n“There was a total void of leadership in our country at that moment,” Judy Lemons, Pelosi’s chief of staff from 1987 to 2002, says in the above excerpt. “Nancy Pelosi was the one leading the country in that moment. She had to be the one dealing with this crisis. And that’s what she did.”\n\n“She found herself in a singular position of power, with a singular responsibility, at this crucial and dangerous moment, and that was not an accident,” Washington Post columnist Matt Bai says at the end of the clip. “That was a long time coming.”\n\nPelosi’s Power, premiering Tuesday, March 22 at 9/8c on PBS, is the first documentary to explore Pelosi’s journey from her 1987 election as a freshman representative (D-Calif.) to the highest-ranking member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The 90-minute film draws on dozens of in-depth interviews: with Pelosi herself; with her family; with her staffers, Congressional colleagues and fierce opponents; with White House insiders; and with journalists and biographers who have chronicled the career of the woman who is now second in line to the presidency.\n\nWhat emerges is a vivid portrait of one of America’s most powerful and polarizing political figures.\n\n“She’s a no-holds-barred politician that was about partisan warfare 100% of the time,” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) says in the film.\n\nSays Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “Nancy Pelosi has never been accused of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”\n\nThe documentary traces Pelosi’s approach to wielding power back to her childhood in Baltimore, where her father was mayor and a U.S. representative. It explores how Pelosi navigated what Lemons calls “entrenched paternalism and crude sexism” after being elected to Congress in 1987 as one of only 23 women in the 435-person chamber. And it investigates her ascent to the speakership as she fought for policies in support of her self-described lifelong ambition: creating a better future for “the children.”\n\n“Nancy Pelosi came up in a historical era where you increasingly did see politics as combat,” Ball says in the documentary. “So she always said, ‘Every morning, I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast, and go out and do battle.’”\n\nIncluding, as the documentary shows, with Donald Trump.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an illuminating window into the speaker: who she is, what drives her and why she believes democracy itself is at stake.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check/jan-6-capitol-pelosi', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist', 'Snippet': 'Several lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/jan-6-pelosi-schumer-capitol-riot-video-201232951.html', 'Headline': 'Dramatic new Jan. 6 footage shows Pelosi and Schumer calling ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""A violent mob of President Donald Trump's supporters storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov.

Ralph Northam in which she wondered if he could deploy his state\'s National Guard troops to the Capitol. She told Northam that House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was making the same request of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Schumer and Pelosi were also seen on the phone with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen asking for him to get President Donald Trump to call off his supporters.\n\n""Why don’t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility — a public statement they should all leave?"" Schumer said.\n\nOne of the central questions lingering after the attack was why it took so long for National Guard troops to provide the overwhelmed Capitol Police officers with backup. Trump and his allies have repeatedly blamed Pelosi, with Trump telling The Washington Post in April, ""I thought it was a shame, and I kept asking why isn’t she doing something about it? Why isn’t Nancy Pelosi doing something about it? And the mayor of D.C. also. The mayor of D.C. and Nancy Pelosi are in charge.""\n\nThe video from Thursday\'s hearing shows Pelosi and other congressional leaders repeatedly asking for help from law enforcement.\n\nEventually, the video showed Pelosi and Schumer in a room with GOP congressional leaders at the time: Sen.

Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate Democratic whip, appeared in another clip with leaders.\n\nAt 4:22 p.m., Pelosi was on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who was in a separate secure location. She told Pence that they had spoken to McConnell about expediting the process of certifying the 2020 electoral votes.\n\n""What we are being told very directly is it’s going to take days for the Capitol to be OK again,"" Pelosi told Pence.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}}",100.0,2

Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-21-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration’s 21 Executive Actions to Reduce Gun', 'Snippet': 'Keeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands 4. The Justice Department published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.', 'Full_text': 'President Biden has made historic progress on actions to reduce gun violence. To implement his comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime, the Biden Administration has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president’s at this point in their Administration. Today, the President is celebrating the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation to pass Congress in 30 years.\n\nThe Biden Administration will continue to use all of the tools at its disposal to address the epidemic of gun violence. The President’s FY 2023 budget proposes $32 billion in additional funding to fight crime, including $20.6 billion in discretionary funding for federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement and crime prevention programs, an increase of 11% over FY22 enacted ($18.6 billion) and 18% over FY21 enacted ($17.5 billion).\n\nBut there is so much more that can and must be done to save lives. The President will continue to urge Congress to take further legislative action to keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, strengthening background checks, and enacting safe storage laws.\n\nBelow are 21 ways the Biden Administration has already used executive action to make our communities safer:\n\nKeeping Especially Dangerous Weapons and Repeat Shooters Off Our Streets\n\n1. The Justice Department issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns, which are unserialized, privately made firearms that are increasingly being recovered at crime scenes.\n\n2. The Attorney General directed every U.S. Attorney’s Office nationwide to increase resources dedicated to district specific violent crime strategies.\n\n3. The Justice Department issued a proposed rule to better regulate when devices marketed as firearm stabilizing braces effectively turn pistols into short-barreled rifles subject to the National Firearms Act.\n\nKeeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands\n\n4. The Justice Department published model extreme risk protection order legislation to make it easier for states that want to adopt these red flag laws to do so.\n\n5. The Justice Department issued the first volume of its new, comprehensive report on firearms commerce and trafficking.\n\n6. The Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.\n\n7. The Justice Department launched five new law enforcement strike forces focused on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that have diverted guns to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.\n\n8. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a new paid media campaign featuring a series of public service announcements to reinforce the key message that a simple gun lock can save lives.\n\n9. The Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Office of Emergency Medical Services within the Department of Transportation (DOT), announced that they will jointly create a plan for addressing lethal means safety awareness, education, training, and program evaluation.\n\n10. ATF issued a final rule clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety devices.\n\nMaking Additional Progress to Reduce Community Violence\n\n11. The President called for cities and states to use American Rescue Plan funding to reduce gun crime and other violent crime, including by investing in community violence interventions and prevention. Through May 2022, $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds had been committed to public safety and violence prevention – including at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds committed by more than half of states and more than 300 communities across the country\n\n12. Five federal agencies made changes to 26 different programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible. For example\n\n• The National Institutes of Health announced funding through its Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research grants for four community violence programs – including a place-based strategy involving repurposing vacant lots in Detroit, an evaluation of READI Chicago, a burnout prevention program for violence interrupters in Chicago, and a hospital-based violence intervention program focused on youth in Virginia.\n\n• The Justice Department announced $187 million for states and $85 million for localities through the Byrne JAG Program to support coordinated violence prevention and intervention; the Department explicitly encouraged the use of these funds for CVI.\n\n• The Department of Housing and Urban Development published a guide explaining to localities how Community Development Block Grants – a $3.4 billion annual funding stream –can be used to fund CVI strategies.\n\n• The Department of Education released a letter to state school associations on how 21st Century Learning Centers funds and Student Support and Academic enrichment programs – both billion-dollar formula grant funding streams – can be used to fund CVI strategies in schools.\n\n13. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hosted a webinar and published information to educate states on how they can use Medicaid to reimburse certain community violence intervention programs, like Hospital-Based Violence Interventions. Last year, Connecticut and Illinois enacted legislation that allows Medicaid to reimburse providers for hospital-based violence prevention services – the first two states in the country to pursue this approach. According to reporting by USA Today, “[t]he idea has been in the works for years, advocates say, but not until the Biden administration signaled that states could – and should – use Medicaid dollars to support these violence prevention programs have state lawmakers stepped up.”\n\n14. Senior White House staff established The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure.\n\nProviding Law Enforcement with the Tools and Resources They Need to Reduce Gun Violence\n\n15. The Justice Department announced $139 million in grants to local law enforcement that will put over 1,000 police officers on the beat through the COPS Office Hiring Program.\n\n16. The Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) expanded the Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Firearms Technical Assistance Project (FTAP).\n\nAddressing the Root Causes of Gun Violence\n\n17. The Department of Labor awarded $89 million through its YouthBuild program to provide pre-apprenticeship opportunities for young people ages 16-24.\n\n18. The Department of Labor awarded $20 million through its Workforce Pathways for Youth program to expand workforce development activities that serve youth ages 14-21 during “out of school” time (non-school hours).\n\n19. The Department of Labor awarded $85.5 million to help formerly incarcerated adults and young people in 28 communities transition out of the criminal justice system and connect with quality jobs.\n\n20. The Department of Labor awarded $25.5 million in Young Adult Reentry Partnership grants to organizations that will help provide education and training services to young adults between 18-24 who were previously involved with the justice system or who left high school before graduation.\n\n21. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program, awarded nearly $1 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) supplemental funding to support services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and their children.\n\n###'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our-communities-safer/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Reduce Gun ...', 'Snippet': 'President Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers ...', 'Full_text': ""Today, in Monterey Park, California, President Biden will announce an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the number of background checks conducted before firearm sales, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. The Executive Order will also keep more guns out of dangerous hands by increasing the effective use of “red flag” laws, strengthen efforts to hold the gun industry accountable, and accelerate law enforcement efforts to identify and apprehend the shooters menacing our communities. President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors.\n\nPresident Biden is traveling to Monterey Park to grieve with the families and community impacted by the mass shooting that claimed 11 lives and injured nine others in January. Monterey Park is part of a growing list of communities all across the country that are forever changed due to gun violence—not only mass shootings, but also daily acts of gun violence that may not make national headlines.\n\nLast year, President Biden signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30 years. When celebrating the Act’s passage, he called on Congress to seize the bipartisan momentum and advance additional commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. Again and again, he has called for Congress to act, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, closing the dating violence restraining order loophole, and repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.\n\nAs he continues to call on Congress to act, President Biden will do everything he can to reduce gun violence and save lives. That is why, over the past two years, President Biden has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their presidency.\n\nThe President’s new Executive Order to reduce gun violence includes the following additional actions, all of which fall within existing executive authority and outside of the right protected by the Second Amendment:\n\nKeeping guns out of dangerous hands\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nIncrease the number of background checks by ensuring that all background checks required by law are conducted before firearm purchases, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. A large majority of Americans support background checks and agree it’s common sense to check whether someone is a felon or domestic abuser before allowing them to buy a gun. The President will continue to call on Congress to pass universal background check legislation. In the meantime, he is directing the Attorney General to do everything he can to ensure that firearms sellers who do not realize they are required to run background checks under existing law, or who are willfully violating existing law, become compliant with background check requirements. Specifically, the President is directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying, as appropriate, the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, as updated by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This move would mean fewer guns will be sold without background checks, and therefore fewer guns will end up in the hands of felons and domestic abusers. The President is also directing the Attorney General to develop and implement a plan to prevent former federally licensed firearms dealers, whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered, from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.\n\nImprove public awareness and increase appropriate use of extreme risk protection (“red flag”) orders and safe storage of firearms. 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws, allowing trusted community members to petition a court to determine whether an individual is dangerous, and then to temporarily remove an individual’s access to firearms. However, these laws are only effective if the public knows when and how to use red flag orders. President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders, including by partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders. In addition, President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to expand existing federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\nAddress the loss or theft of firearms during shipping. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data indicates an over 250% increase in the number of firearms reported as lost or stolen during shipment between federally licensed firearms dealers, from roughly 1,700 in 2018 to more than 6,100 in 2022. President Biden is directing the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\nHolding the gun industry accountable\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nProvide the public and policymakers with more information regarding federally licensed firearms dealers who are violating the law. Gun dealers violating federal law put us all at risk by increasing the likelihood that firearms will fall into dangerous hands. The President is directing the Attorney General to publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, ATF records from the inspection of firearms dealers cited for violation of federal firearm laws. This information will empower the public and policymakers to better understand the problem, and then improve our laws to hold rogue gun dealers accountable.\n\nUse the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms to further firearm and public safety practices. The Department of Defense buys a large number of firearms and other weapons to protect and serve our country. The President is directing the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through Department of Defense acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\nPresident Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to all civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nAdditional steps to make our communities safer and support communities impacted by gun violence\n\nThe Executive Order will direct the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nHelp catch shooters by accelerating federal law enforcement’s reporting of ballistics data. The National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) allows federal, state, and local law enforcement to match fired cartridge casings to the guns from which they were fired, making it easier for law enforcement to connect multiple crime scenes and catch shooters. In order to maximize NIBIN’s effectiveness, federal, state, and local law enforcement all have an important role to play in ensuring timely submission of ballistics data to NIBIN. Today, the President is directing all federal law enforcement agencies to issue rigorous requirements regarding NIBIN data submission and use of this tool.\n\nAccelerate and intensify implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). BSCA is the most significant gun safety legislative accomplishment in nearly 30 years, and the Biden-Harris Administration is treating it as such by making the most of every opportunity it provides to reduce gun violence. President Biden is directing each agency responsible for the law’s implementation to send a report to him, within 60 days, on progress toward full implementation of BSCA and additional steps they will take to maximize the benefits of the law, including by increasing public awareness and use of the resources made available by BSCA.\n\nImprove federal support for gun violence survivors, victims and survivors’ families, first responders to gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. When a hurricane overwhelms a community, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations in order to assess and meet community needs. However, when a mass shooting overwhelms a community, no coordinated U.S. government mechanism exists to meet short- and long-term needs, such as mental health care for grief and trauma, financial assistance (for example, when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business is shut down due to a lengthy shooting investigation), and food (for example, when the Buffalo shooting closed down the only grocery store in the neighborhood). The President is directing members of his Cabinet to develop a proposal for how the federal government can better support communities after a mass shooting, and identify what additional resources or authorities the executive branch would need from Congress to implement this proposal.\n\nAdvance congressional efforts to prevent the proliferation of firearms undetectable by metal detectors. In recent years, we’ve seen the rise of technology that allows guns to be made with polymers and other materials that are increasingly capable of avoiding detection by metal detectors. President Biden is directing the Attorney General to help Congress modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, which is currently set to expire in December 2023.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/14/executive-order-on-reducing-gun-violence-and-making-our-communities-safer/', 'Headline': 'Executive Order on Reducing Gun Violence and Making Our Communities', 'Snippet': 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows: Section 1.

Policy. Every few days in the United States, we mourn a new mass shooting. Daily acts of gun violence — including community violence, domestic violence, suicide, and accidental shootings — may not always make the evening news, but they too cut lives short and leave survivors and their communities with long-lasting physical and mental wounds. We cannot accept these facts as the enduring reality of life in America. Instead, we must together insist that we have had enough, and that we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation.\n\nIt is the policy of my Administration that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will pursue every legally available and appropriate action to reduce gun violence. Through this whole-of-government approach, my Administration has made historic progress to save lives. My Administration has taken action to keep guns out of dangerous hands and especially dangerous weapons off of our streets; hold gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers accountable; fund accountable, effective community policing; and invest in community violence interventions and prevention strategies.\n\nLast year, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (the “Act”), the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides communities with new tools to combat gun violence, including enhanced gun background checks for individuals under age 21, funding for extreme risk protection orders and other crisis interventions, and increased mental health resources to help children impacted by gun violence heal from the resulting grief and trauma.\n\nI continue to call on the Congress to take additional action to reduce gun violence, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, funding my comprehensive Safer America Plan, and expanding community violence intervention and prevention strategies. In the meantime, my Administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.\n\nSec. 2. Implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of this order describing what actions their respective agencies have taken to implement the Act, data and analysis regarding the use and early effects of the Act, and additional steps their respective agencies will take to maximize the benefits of the Act. These reports shall include a plan for increasing public awareness and use of resources made available by the Act.\n\nSec. 3. Additional Agency Actions to Reduce Gun Violence. (a) The Attorney General shall develop and implement a plan to:\n\n(i) clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, and thus required to become Federal firearms licensees (FFLs), in order to increase compliance with the Federal background check requirement for firearm sales, including by considering a rulemaking, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law;\n\n(ii) prevent former FFLs whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms;\n\n(iii) publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, inspection reports of FFL dealers cited for violations of the law; and\n\n(iv) support efforts to modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act (18 U.S.C. 922(p)).\n\n(b) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand existing Federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\n(c) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; and the Secretary of Education shall undertake efforts to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders (“red flag” laws), partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders.\n\n(d) The Attorney General; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop a proposal for the President, and submit it no later than September 15, 2023, on how the Federal Government can better support the recovery, mental health, and other needs of survivors of gun violence, families of victims and survivors of gun violence, first responders to incidents of gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. The proposal should draw on existing evidence, where available, and take into account how to address needs in both the immediate aftermath of mass shootings and in the years following such events. The proposal should recommend any additional executive branch coordination and additional resources or authorities from the Congress needed to implement the proposal, as well as how agencies will assess the outcomes for the activities implemented.\n\n(e) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\n(f) The heads of Federal law enforcement agencies shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the date of this order, ensure that their respective law enforcement components issue National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) submission and utilization policies with requirements that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements of the policy issued by the Department of Justice on December 12, 2022, to ensure the prompt entry of ballistics data recovered in connection with criminal investigations into NIBIN. In consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense policies may be tailored to address specific operational considerations.\n\n(g) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, shall work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment between FFLs and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\n(h) The Federal Trade Commission is encouraged to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nSec. 4. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the term “Federal law enforcement agency” means an organizational unit or subunit of the executive branch that employs officers who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, and that is responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime or the apprehension of alleged offenders. The term “heads of Federal law enforcement agencies” means the heads of those units or subunits.\n\nSec. 5. General Provisions.

Gun rights advocates have vowed to challenge the rule."", 'Full_text': 'A bi-partisan group of 20 U.S. Senators Sunday announced an outline for gun safety reform, signaling a step forward in the effort to address recent back-to-back mass shootings while also balancing second amendment rights.\n\nThe package’s key points include “enhanced review” of juvenile and mental health records of would-be gun buyers under 21, support for state and tribal governments to implement so-called “red flag” laws like Massachusetts\' 2018 law that removes weapons from people deemed dangerous, and “major investments” to ease access to community mental health and suicide prevention programs, according to the announcement.\n\nNews of the federal compromise drew praise from Massachusetts-based gun law reform advocates.\n\n“Our strong gun laws are great,” said Rina Schneur, co-lead for the Massachusetts chapter of the advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense. “But they’re only as good as our borders and we don’t have borders between states, so having federal gun laws is as important.”\n\nMassachusetts is typically applauded for having some of the nation’s strongest gun laws, but as a potential federal gun control deal emerges, Schneur and others say if the state wants to stay ahead on the issue, restricting all gun purchases to those 21 and up and banning ghost guns are among the list of local reforms.\n\nAri Freilich is state policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national organization formed in the wake of the 2011 attempted assassination of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The organization\'s latest annual gun law scorecard gave Massachusetts an A- grade for its laws.\n\nFreilich singled out age requirements as one place where Massachusetts lags behind other states with strict gun regulations.\n\nWith parental permission, children as young as 15 may obtain a firearm identification card required to possess non-large capacity rifles and shotguns in Massachusetts, and a person must be at least 18 years old to purchase one of those guns. Other firearms, like large capacity handguns, rifles and shotguns, require people to obtain a license to carry and be at least 21 years old for purchase.\n\n“The Uvalde school shooter purchased his murder weapons just days after he became eligible under Texas law when he turned 18,"" Freilich said. ""In some states, he would not have been able to buy those weapons for another three years.""\n\nFirearms like the one used in the Uvalde attack are known as AR-15-style rifles since they are modeled like the popular semiautomatic gun first manufactured by ArmaLite, Inc. These guns are sometimes referred to as assault weapons and are banned in Massachusetts.\n\nThough federal law restricts long gun sales to people 18 or older, a handful of states have enacted stricter laws. California, Illinois and a few other states require rifle and shotgun buyers be at least 21 years old. Just this month, New York signed into law a higher age limit for purchasing semiautomatic rifles — a response to a last month\'s mass shooting in which a teen gunman is suspected of opening fire on a Buffalo grocery in a predominately Black community.\n\nJim Wallace, executive director of Gun Owners Action League, the state association for gun owners, said he wouldn’t support such a law. He pointed to a recent ruling of a federal appeals court that found California’s ban on the sale of certain guns to adults younger than 21 unconstitutional.\n\n“The carnage that we’ve seen from these killers, the common denominator is not access to a certain tool, it’s that they’re severely mentally ill and they’re allowed to walk amongst us,” Wallace said.\n\nLast year, a team of researchers who examined mass shooters found that many suffered from mental illness that went untreated as they committed their crimes.\n\n“If we’re going to, once again, kick the can down the road [with an age threshold increase] what happens when that psychotic killer turns 21?” he asked.\n\nAnother immediate step gun safety organizations endorse is banning so-called ghost guns, or user-assembled firearms that typically lack serial numbers and are difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace.\n\nSellers of such weapons exploit a loophole that allows gun parts to bought and sold more freely than fully assembled guns.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\'s administration has attempted to address the problem with a new U.S. Justice Department policy that will legally define the easy assembly ghost gun kits as firearms and require sellers to become federally licensed, include serial numbers on their products and run background checks on buyers prior to sale. Gun rights advocates have vowed to challenge the rule.\n\n“I don’t think an approach to our civil liberties with a view to law enforcement’s ease is the right way to think about things,” said Cody Wilson, founder of the firearms blueprint nonprofit Defense Distributed.\n\nWilson pleaded guilty to injury of a child, a felony, after having sex with an underage girl. While federal law bars felons from buying or selling guns at stores, Wilson\'s plea deal allows him to maintain ownership of his guns and run a business that sells plans for making 3D-printed guns.\n\nWilson said responsible commercial manufacturers should serialize their components and participate with law enforcement to help solve crimes. But he does not believe ghost guns are the problem that Biden and activists are making them out to be, pointing out the lack of ghost guns in the recent shootings that seized the national consciousness.\n\n“Our space — the ghost gun space specifically — emerges with a clientele or a customer base which does not trust law enforcement,” Wilson said in an interview with GBH News. “I don’t want the NSA and the FBI and all these people to have special access to our communications … neither do I want a great many law enforcement agencies to have access to our gun records.""\n\nExactly how many ghost guns have been used to commit crimes in Massachusetts remains unclear.\n\nIn an email exchange earlier this month, a media official for the Massachusetts State Police said their database is not capable of determining how many ghost guns were recovered from crime scenes in the past year, but “the actual criminal charge would be the same for any illegally possessed firearm (including ghost guns).”\n\nIn Boston, police say 9% of the 636 guns recovered from crime scenes last year were ghost guns. The issue came into the local spotlight after a recent arrest prompted the seizure of multiple gun parts at what interim Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden referred to as a “ghost gun mill.”\n\nFreilich said ghost guns are typically a day-to-day problem in states that strongly regulate gun ownership. He said some states have brought forth laws to treat the core portions of the weapons the same as guns and/or regulate the 3D printers that can be used to create gun parts.\n\nRuth Zakarin, executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, said her organization supports both the minimum purchase age increase and stronger regulation of ghost guns to combat the more routine incidents of violence in local communities. Guns represented the killing instrument in nearly 30% of the 150 recorded homicides across the state in 2021, according to data from the state\'s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.\n\n“Gun violence is happening in communities in Massachusetts all the time,” Zakarin said.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives.""

The President, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has proposed a minimum nursing staff standard for facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities have died because of COVID-19.\n\n""That\'s unacceptable,"" Xavier Becerra, the secretary of HHS, told Morning Edition.\n\nRoughly three quarters of long-term care facilities would have to hire additional staff to meet the administration\'s requirements, CMS estimates.\n\n""It\'s a big change in the sense that the industry hasn\'t had to follow particular standards,"" Becerra said.

This proposed rule builds on the President’s historic Action Plan for Nursing Home Reform launched in the 2022 State of the Union.\n\nToday’s action is one among many advanced by the Biden-Harris Administration to build a long-term care system where all older Americans can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high quality services in the setting of their choice, where family caregivers are adequately supported, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\n“Establishing minimum staffing standards for nursing homes will improve resident safety and promote high-quality care so residents and their families can have peace of mind,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer. They might be unable to use the bathroom, shower, maintain hygiene, change clothes, get out of bed, or have someone respond to their call for assistance. Comprehensive staffing reforms can improve working conditions, leading to higher wages and better retention for this dedicated workforce.”\n\n“CMS is proud to be leading the President’s initiative to improve the lives of over 1.2 million residents who reside in Medicare and Medicaid-certified long-term care facilities, and those who will need that care in the future,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Today, we took an important first step to propose new staffing requirements that will hold nursing homes accountable and make sure that residents get the safe, high-quality care that they deserve.”\n\nUnder CMS’s proposal, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid would be required to meet specific nurse staffing levels that promote safe, high-quality care for residents. Nursing homes would need to provide residents with a minimum of 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident per day, and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident per day, exceeding existing standards in nearly all states. CMS estimates approximately three quarters (75%) of nursing homes would have to strengthen staffing in their facilities. As the long-term care sector continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed standards take into consideration local realities in rural and underserved communities through staggered implementation and exemptions processes.\n\nIn addition, nursing homes would also be required to ensure a registered nurse is on site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and to complete robust facility assessments on staffing needs. Facilities would continue to be required to provide staffing that meets the needs of the individual residents they serve, which may require higher levels of staffing above the proposed minimum standards.\n\nCMS also proposes to require states to collect and report on compensation for workers as a percentage of Medicaid payments for those working in nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These policies build on CMS’ recent proposals to support compensation for direct care workers in home- and community-based settings and to publish Medicaid data on average hourly pay rates for home care workers. This enhanced transparency will aid efforts to support and stabilize the long-term care workforce across settings. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to strengthening access to high-quality long-term care both at home, in the community as well as in nursing homes and other facilities.\n\nAdditionally, CMS announced a national campaign to support staffing in nursing homes. As part of the HHS Workforce Initiative, CMS will work with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other partners to make it easier for individuals to enter careers in nursing homes, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as scholarships and tuition reimbursement. This staffing campaign builds on other actions by HHS and the Department of Labor to build the nursing workforce.\n\n“Wages are an important part of job quality and drive challenges in recruitment and retention of direct care workers. Our research shows that in many places these workers can earn higher wages doing other entry-level work,” said Miranda Lynch-Smith, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nMore than 500,000 direct care workers provide care in nursing homes, assisting residents with daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, and eating. This work, performed primarily by women of color, is significantly undervalued. Direct care workers across long-term care settings earn low wages, rarely receive health and retirement benefits, and experience high injury rates. Improving working conditions and wages will lead to improvements in the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and enable nursing staff to provide safer care.\n\nFindings published by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation show that wages for direct care workers trail other entry-level jobs. In 2019, median wages for nursing assistants were lower than the wages of other entry level jobs in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As an example, the median wage for nursing assistants in Louisiana is $10.90 per hour, compared to $13.41 for other entry-level positions. This is despite the significant demands of direct care jobs and their essential role in meeting the long-term care needs of older adults and people with disabilities.\n\nOther announcements from CMS and the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made today would increase transparency, enhance enforcement of existing standards, increase accountability, and ensure safe, high-quality, and dignified care for people living in nursing homes. These announcements include:\n\nIncreasing Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nImproving Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm.

Joined by people with disabilities, family caregivers, long-term care workers, early educators, veterans, and aging advocates, the President will sign an Executive Order that includes more than 50 directives to nearly every cabinet-level agency to expand access to affordable, high-quality care, and provide support for care workers and family caregivers.\n\nToo many families and individuals struggle to access the affordable, high-quality care they need. The cost of child care is up 26% in the last decade and more than 200 percent over the past 30 years. For the elderly or people with disabilities long-term care costs are up 40% in the past decade. The result is many Americans – particularly women – stay out of the workforce to care for their families, making it hard for businesses to attract and retain a skilled workforce and for the economy to grow. A BCG brief forecasts losses of $290 billion each year in gross domestic product in 2030 and beyond if the U.S. fails to address the lack of affordable child care.\n\nAt the same time, many workers providing this critical care find themselves in low-paying jobs with few benefits. Care workers, who are disproportionately women of color, struggle to make ends meet, and turnover rates are high. In addition, at least 53 million Americans serve as family caregivers—including over 5 million caring for service members or veterans—and many face challenges due to lack of support, training, and opportunities for rest.\n\nPresident Biden believes that we must secure significant new federal investments to transform care in this country. That’s why he and Vice President Harris called for investments to support high-quality, affordable child care, preschool, and long-term care in their fiscal year 2024 budget. While Congress considers those proposals, the President is taking immediate action to make care more affordable for American families, support family caregivers, boost compensation and improve job quality for care workers, and expand care options. Specifically, his Executive Order will:\n\nMake child care and long-term care more accessible and affordable for families, including military families. The acute challenges families face in accessing affordable, high-quality care are well documented. In 2019, 76% of families with young children who searched for care reported difficulty finding adequate child care, and military families consistently cite access to high-quality child care as an impediment to military spouse employment and family economic security. More than three-quarters of home and community-based care service providers are not accepting new clients, leaving hundreds of thousands of older Americans and Americans with disabilities on waiting lists for home and community-based services or struggling to afford the care they need. The President is taking action to make child care and long-term care more affordable by directing federal agencies to:\n\nIdentify which of their grant programs can support child care and long-term care for individuals working on federal projects, and consider requiring applicants seeking federal job-creating funds to expand access to care for their workers. This builds off of the historic child care requirement for semiconductor employers seeking significant federal funding under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to submit a plan for how they will help employees access affordable child care. These actions help employers delivering major federal projects recruit and retain a robust, skilled, and diverse workforce.\n\nLower costs for families benefitting from the Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, including by directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to consider actions to reduce or eliminate families’ co-payments for child care.\n\nEnsure the federal government is a model employer by supporting its own workforce. The Executive Order directs the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a review of child care subsidy policy and consider setting standards for when and how federal agencies should provide child care subsidies to federal employees. Additionally, all federal agencies will review opportunities to expand employee access to child care services through federal child care centers, child care subsidies, or contracted care for providers.\n\nProvide support for our service members and their families by directing the Department of Defense to take steps to improve the affordability of child care on military installations.\n\nImprove access to home-based care for veterans. To meet our sacred obligation to our veterans and their families, the Executive Order directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to improve access to home-based care for veterans who require support with activities of daily living, like bathing and getting dressed, by giving them more decision-making power over who delivers that care and when. VA is directed to consider expanding its Veteran Directed Care program to all 172 VA Medical Centers by the end of Fiscal Year 2024. This program provides veterans with a budget to hire personal care assistance including from family members. VA will also consider piloting a new self-directed care program in no fewer than 5 new sites that provides veterans with a budget for personal care assistance while reducing administration burdens related to managing care. Further, VA will consider adding 75 new interdisciplinary teams to its Home-Based Primary Care program to serve an additional 5,600 veterans in their homes.\n\nBoost job quality for early educators. Early care and education professionals are among the lowest-paid workers in the country. Child care workers earn a median wage of less than $18 an hour, while the typical nonsupervisory worker in the U.S. earns over $28 an hour. While the average salary of a public preschool teacher and kindergarten teacher is about $49,000 and $60,000, respectively, the average annual salary for Head Start and preschool teachers is about $35,000. To address this, HHS will take steps to increase the pay and benefits for Head Start teachers and staff. HHS will implement policies so that more child care providers benefiting from CCDBG receive higher reimbursements for the children they serve. Additionally, the Department of Education (ED) will encourage grantees of the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program—which supports thousands of student-parents across the country pay for care while going to school—to improve the quality of the services they provide, including higher wages for child care workers.\n\nEnhance job quality for long-term care workers. The President is committed to improving the quality of long-term care jobs in this country so that Americans can get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve—whether it is in their homes and communities or in nursing homes. To advance the President’s long-term care priorities, the Executive Order directs HHS to consider issuing several regulations and guidance documents to improve the quality of home care jobs, including by leveraging Medicaid funding to ensure there are enough home care workers to provide care to seniors and people with disabilities enrolled in Medicaid, as well as build on the minimum staffing standards for nursing homes and condition a portion of Medicare payments on how well a nursing home retains workers.\n\nSupport family caregivers. Without adequate resources, family caregiving can affect caregivers’ physical and emotional health and well-being and contribute to financial strain. These negative consequences are felt most acutely by women, who make up nearly two-thirds of family caregivers and who drop out of the workforce at higher rates than men. To provide greater support to family caregivers, the Executive Order directs HHS to consider testing a new dementia care model that will include support for respite care (short-term help to give a primary family caregiver a break) and make it easier for family caregivers to access Medicare beneficiary information and provide more support to family caregivers during the hospital discharge planning process. Additionally, VA will consider expanding access to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and provide more mental health support for caregivers enrolled in that program. These actions build on the 2022 National Strategy to Support Caregivers.\n\nAdvance domestic workers’ rights. Care workers should be supported, valued, and fairly compensated, and care workers should have the free and fair choice to join a union. In particular, domestic workers providing care for our loved ones are often underpaid and subject to discrimination and abuse. To provide greater protection for these workers, the Department of Labor will publish a sample employment agreement so domestic child care and long-term care workers and their employers can ensure both parties better understand their rights and responsibilities.\n\nEase construction of early childhood facilities for Tribes. There are approximately half a million American Indian and Alaska Native children under the age of 13 who potentially need child care so their parents can work. Nearly half are below the age of five. To help the families of these children access high-quality child care, HHS will streamline the process for tribal grantees of federal child care assistance and Head Start to apply for and construct or improve early childhood facilities.\n\nEngage affected communities. To make the delivery and design of federal care assistance and programs work better for families, the care workforce, and people seeking care, the Treasury and the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Veterans Affairs, will engage with parents, guardians, and other relatives with care responsibilities; individuals receiving long-term care; State and local care experts; care providers and workers; employers; and labor unions. The Executive Order also encourages the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to consider conducting similar engagement.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration’s Record on Care\n\nThe Administration invested over $60 billion from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act in the care economy, including $39 billion to help child care providers keep their doors open and to provide child care workers with higher pay, bonuses, and other benefits—reducing turnover and attracting new staff. To date, these efforts have helped 220,000 child care programs, which employ more than one million child care workers with the capacity to serve 9.6 million children. In addition, the Administration invested $25 billion in ARP funds to help states strengthen their Medicaid home care programs, including over $9 billion in spending to boost wages for home care workers as well as improve overall job quality.\n\nThe stabilization funding provided through the ARP saved child care in this country. One in three child care programs who received stabilization support report that they would have been forced to close permanently without these funds.\n\nThese grants likely have had effects beyond the child care workforce and providers as access to child care is critical for parental employment, particularly for women. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers analyzed this relationship in their most recent Economic Report of the President, and found that mothers’ employment has recovered more quickly in areas with greater child care capacity supported by ARP stabilization grants. In those areas, employment among mothers with young children outpaced that of mothers in lower ARP-supported areas throughout 2022 and rebounded to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022.\n\nThe FY 2024 President’s Budget builds on these investments and proposes investing $600 billion over 10 years to expand access to high-quality, affordable child care and free, high-quality preschool. This funding will enable States to increase child care options for more than 16 million young children. The proposal lowers costs so that parents can afford to send their children to high-quality child care while also paying child care providers wages that reflect the value they provide families and communities.\n\nThe President’s Budget also includes $150 billion over the next decade to improve and expand Medicaid home care services—making it easier for seniors and people with disabilities to live, work, and participate in their communities. This funding would improve the quality of jobs for home care workers and support family caregivers. The Administration is also promoting the use of apprenticeship programs and partnering with employers, unions, and others to recruit, train, and keep long-term care workers on the job while also helping them advance their careers as registered and licensed nurses. Just this month, the President also signed the first-ever proclamation designating April as National Care Worker Recognition Month, to honor the efforts and sacrifices of our child care and long-term care workers.\n\nThe Administration is committed to getting caregivers the resources and respect they deserve. The National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers outlines nearly 350 actions the federal Government can take to support family caregivers’ health, well-being, and financial security. And the ARP provided $145 million to help the National Family Caregiver Support Program deliver counseling, training, and short-term relief to family and other informal care providers. The Administration has also expanded the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to veterans of all service eras so more veteran caregivers have the financial and mental health support they deserve. Through the First Lady’s Joining Forces initiative, the Administration has partnered with more than 50 public and private sector organizations to launch the “Hidden Helpers” Coalition to serve the 2.3 million military and veteran children in caregiving homes.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/10/biden-harris-administration-announces-100-million-grow-nursing-workforce.html', 'Headline': 'The Biden-Harris Administration Announces $100 Million to Grow the ...', 'Snippet': 'The nursing workforce is essential to improving health outcomes and health care delivery across settings – including in hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities – as well as in community practice such as nurse-run clinics, provider offices, health centers, schools and home and community-based care.

These investments will address the increasing demand for registered nurses, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and nurse faculty.\n\n“Nurses are an essential part of our nation’s health care system,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Now more than ever, we need to double down on our investments in nurses who care for communities across the country.”\n\n“Nurses are the frontline in delivering life-saving care and in keeping all of us healthy and well,” said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. “Today’s investments from the Health Resources and Services Administration demonstrate our ongoing commitment to supporting the nursing workforce, training and growing the next generation of nurses, creating career ladders for nurses, and recognizing the critical role nurses play in primary care, mental health care, and maternal health care”\n\nThe nursing workforce is essential to improving health outcomes and health care delivery across settings – including in hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities – as well as in community practice such as nurse-run clinics, provider offices, health centers, schools and home and community-based care.

Policy. High-quality early care and education and long-term care are critical to our Nation’s economic growth and economic security. Early care and education give young children a strong start in life, while long-term care helps older Americans and people with disabilities live, work, and participate in their communities with dignity. Access to both types of care is also critical to our national security because it helps ensure the recruitment, readiness, and retention of our military service members.\n\nThroughout this order, early care and education are collectively referred to as “child care.” References to “care” that do not specify the type of care refer to both child care and long-term care. References to the “care workforce” refer to individuals and businesses working in the fields of child care and long-term care.\n\nA sizeable majority of families and individuals in the United States who require care cannot access the affordable, high-quality care they need. The markets for child care and long-term care for persons with disabilities and older adults who need support in their homes and communities fail to deliver enough high-quality care because of a persistent gap between the costs of providing this care and the prices families can pay. High-quality care is labor intensive and requires skilled workers, and providers have limited ability to reduce costs. As a result, even when high-quality care is available, it costs far more than many families and individuals can afford, causing them to forgo care altogether, seek lower-quality care options, juggle unconventional shifts at work, reduce their own paid work hours, drop out of the labor force, or make other arrangements. Care expenditures represent a significant and increasing share of families’ budgets, with child care prices growing by approximately 26 percent and some types of long-term care costs growing by over 40 percent in the last decade. Inadequate supply is exacerbated by high turnover in the care workforce. Care workers — disproportionately women of color — are among the lowest-paid in the country and often have to rely on public benefits despite working complex and demanding jobs. Investments in the care workforce are foundational to helping to retain care workers and improving health and educational outcomes. In recent years, more than half of the long-term care workforce and nearly 20 percent of the child care workforce turned over each year. And the workforce remains 8 percent smaller than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2019, more than three in four United States households that searched for care reported difficulty finding adequate care for their young children, and roughly the same share of center-based child care providers turned families away because they lacked enough child care slots. Similarly, more than three in four long-term care service providers have reported not being able to accept new clients, making it harder for older Americans and people with disabilities to find the care they need. Military families consistently cite access to high-quality child care as an impediment to military spouse employment and family economic security. Difficulty accessing care also poses a challenge for both spouses — and, as data shows, particularly for women in dual military couples — to continuing their service if they have caregiving responsibilities. The need for long-term care is likely to become more acute as our Nation’s population ages. By 2060, there will be approximately twice as many adults over the age of 65 than in 2016, and projections indicate that there will be around 8 million long-term care job openings over the next decade.\n\nFamily caregivers provide informal, often unpaid, care to help loved ones live in their homes and communities, including caring for aging family members, people with disabilities, and children. At least 53 million people are family caregivers in the United States — including 5.5 million who are caring for wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans — and many face challenges due to lack of support, training, and opportunities for rest. Family caregivers include spouses, parents, siblings, adult and minor children, grandparents, and other relatives. Family caregivers reflect the diversity of America’s communities, and people can assume family caregiving responsibilities at any stage of life. Without adequate resources, family caregiving can affect caregivers’ own physical and emotional health and well-being and contribute to financial strain. These negative consequences are felt most acutely by women, who make up nearly two-thirds of family caregivers and drop out of the workforce at a rate three times higher than men.\n\nIt is the policy of my Administration to enable families — including our military and veteran families — to have access to affordable, high-quality care and to have support and resources as caregivers themselves. It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that the care workforce is supported, valued, and paid well. Additionally, care workers should have the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\nThe Congress must provide the transformative investments necessary to increase access to high-quality child care — including preschool and Head Start — and long-term care services, as well as high-quality, well-paying jobs that reflect the value the care workforce provides to families and communities. Such investments include removing barriers and providing the funding needed for Tribal Nations to effectively provide high-quality child care and long-term care.\n\nNearly every other advanced country makes greater public investments in care than the United States. Investing in care is an investment in the future of America’s families, workforce, and economy.\n\nWhile the Congress must make significant new investments to give families in this country more breathing room when it comes to care, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must do what they can within their existing authorities to boost the supply of high-quality early care and education and long-term care and to provide support for family caregivers. Through this order, I direct agencies to make all efforts to improve jobs and support for caregivers, increase access to affordable care for families, and provide more care options for families.\n\nSec. 2. Increasing Compensation and Improving Job Quality for Family Caregivers, Early Educators, and Long-Term Care Workers. (a) To increase compensation and benefits for early childhood educators and long-term care professionals who are providing federally funded services:\n\n(i) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), shall issue guidance to States on ways to use enhanced funding to better connect home- and community-based workers who provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries;\n\n(ii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall implement strategies to encourage comparability of compensation and benefits between staff employed by Head Start grant recipients and elementary school teachers;\n\n(iii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall expand efforts to improve care workers’ access to health insurance;

and\n\n(iii) implement strategies to expand mental health support for the care workforce, including early childhood providers supported through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and Head Start.\n\n(c) To expand training pathways and professional learning opportunities to increase job quality, improve quality of care, and attract new entrants into the care workforce, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall:\n\n(i) encourage recipients of Federal financial assistance to expand opportunities for early childhood educators and long-term care professionals through community college programming, career and technical education, Registered Apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeships leading to Registered Apprenticeship, and other job training and professional development;\n\n(ii) make available innovative funding opportunities, develop and evaluate demonstration projects for care training and educational attainment, and provide technical assistance to State, local, and Tribal partners to improve job quality for care occupations; and\n\n(iii) develop partnerships with key stakeholders, including State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; unions and labor organizations; State and local workforce development boards; institutions of higher education (including community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions); aging and disability networks; and national- and community-based organizations that focus on care (including professional membership organizations).\n\n(d) To support family caregivers of beneficiaries of Federal health care programs and services, and in conjunction with implementing the 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers:\n\n(i) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, consistent with the criteria set out in section 1115A(b)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2)), consider whether to select for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation an innovative new health care payment and service delivery model focused on dementia care that would include family caregiver supports such as respite care;\n\n(ii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider how better to evaluate and clearly set expectations for family caregivers in the Acute Hospital Care at Home program, which allows hospitals to treat in their homes those who would otherwise be hospital inpatients;\n\n(iii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps to ensure that hospitals are actively involving family caregivers in the discharge planning process, consistent with CMS condition of participation discharge planning requirements, including by promoting best practices such as partnerships with community-based organizations and using resources from the Administration for Community Living and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;\n\n(iv) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall increase beneficiary communications and support family caregivers by increasing promotion of the option for Medicare beneficiaries to choose to give family caregivers access to their Medicare information via 1-800-MEDICARE and the State health insurance assistance program networks;\n\n(v) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking by the end of this fiscal year that would make any appropriate modifications to eligibility criteria for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which provides services and benefits, including a monthly stipend, for eligible caregivers of veterans who sustained a serious injury or illness in the line of duty; and\n\n(vi) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop and implement a pilot program to offer psychotherapy via video telehealth to family caregivers within the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to improve their access to mental health services.\n\n(e) To improve and expand opportunities through AmeriCorps to encourage more individuals to enter early learning careers, the Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps is encouraged to consider:\n\n(i) expanding access to Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards, which AmeriCorps members can use to pay for education and training or reduce their student debt; providing loan forbearance for AmeriCorps members involved in early learning; and providing other benefits to supplement national service activities that support early learning; and\n\n(ii) prioritizing applications that propose to implement or expand high-quality programs focused on early learning and prioritizing projects intended to prepare AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers to enter early learning careers.\n\n(f) To improve jobs of domestic child care and long-term care workers:\n\n(i) the Secretary of Labor shall create and publish in multiple languages, as appropriate, compliance assistance and best practices materials — such as sample employment agreements for domestic child care and long-term care workers and their employers — to promote fair workplaces and ensure the parties know their rights and responsibilities, and shall identify other means to promote employers’ adoption of best practices;\n\n(ii) the Secretary of Labor shall work with community and other local partners to expand culturally and linguistically appropriate community outreach and education efforts to domestic child care and long-term care workers in order to combat their exploitation; and\n\n(iii) the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is encouraged to work with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop materials addressing the employment rights of non-citizen domestic child care and long-term care workers who are legally eligible to work.\n\n(g) To improve data and information on the care workforce:\n\n(i) the Secretary of Labor shall conduct and publish an analysis of early childhood and home care workers’ pay in comparison to the pay of other workers with similar levels of training and skill;\n\n(ii) the Secretary of Labor shall issue guidance to help States and localities conduct their own analyses of comparable pay rates for care workers in their respective jurisdictions; and\n\n(iii) the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in consultation with relevant agencies and external experts and organizations, jointly conduct a review to identify gaps in knowledge about the home- and community-based workforce serving people with disabilities and older adults; identify and evaluate existing data sources; and identify opportunities to expand analyses, supplement data, or launch new efforts to provide important data on the home- and community-based care workforce and ensure equity for people with disabilities and older adults. The Secretaries shall publicly release the findings and recommendations of this review no later than April 2024.\n\nSec. 3. Making Care More Accessible and Affordable for Families. (a) To increase access to affordable, high-quality child care and long-term care for workers delivering federally assisted projects:\n\n(i) Agencies shall identify and issue guidance on which agency discretionary, formula, and program-specific funds can be used for child care and long-term care as a supportive service for workers who are being trained for and working on federally funded projects, and in doing so shall consider agency funds made available by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58); Public Law 117-169, commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022; and division A of Public Law 117-167, known as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022.\n\n(ii) With respect to the agency funds identified in subsection (a)(i) of this section:\n\n(A) Agencies shall consider requiring, where appropriate, applicants for Federal job-creation or workforce development funds to provide affordable, accessible, safe, and reliable child care and long-term care for workers carrying out federally assisted projects (including both construction and operating phases where applicable), or shall consider preferencing applicants that use the funds for this purpose or encouraging applicants to use funds for this purpose. Agencies shall provide implementation guidance to relevant program staff and collaborate with the Department of Labor to identify potential support for these actions, including technical assistance for guidance and funding opportunities.\n\n(B) Agencies shall consider providing technical assistance to help funding recipients provide access to child care and long-term care as a supportive service and to connect funding recipients with potential partners, including care associations, community-based organizations, Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs, and labor unions.\n\n(C) In cases where child care or long-term care is required or encouraged, agencies shall consider collecting information from funding recipients on whether and how they will provide access to child care and long-term care, and how many workers (including apprentices and pre-apprentices) would be affected.\n\n(iii) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall support the efforts outlined in subsection (a) of this section by issuing guidance and providing technical assistance with best practices and models for how to provide supportive services, including child care and long-term care.\n\n(b) To lower child care costs for families eligible for Federal programs, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall:\n\n(i) consider issuing regulations to pursue policies to reduce child care costs for families benefiting from CCDF;\n\n(ii) identify potential opportunities to reduce barriers to eligibility for Head Start and CCDF;\n\n(iii) encourage States, through all available avenues, to increase the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds for basic assistance and work supports for families — including access to child care — and to spend more funds on cash assistance for families; and\n\n(iv) identify other potential strategies to make child care and Head Start more accessible for those families most in need.\n\n(c) To help more Federal employees access affordable care:\n\n(i) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall consider establishing criteria that support equitable and accessible employee participation in child care programs, to include agencies’ adoption of income thresholds that are aligned with increasing costs of child care;\n\n(ii) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall conduct a review of child care subsidy policy and agency program data to determine the effectiveness of current child care subsidies within the Federal Government;\n\n(iii) the heads of agencies are encouraged to expand employee access to child care services through Federal child care centers, child care subsidies, or contracted care providers; and\n\n(iv) the Department of Defense shall take steps to enhance recruitment and retention of the Department’s child development program workers and to improve the affordability of child care for service members by September 2023, in addition to its ongoing efforts as part of the Fourteenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation to assess how child care costs impact the ability of the military to attract and retain its workforce.\n\nSec. 4. Expanding Options for Families by Building the Supply of Care. (a) To provide families with more options for high-quality long-term, home-, and community-based care and early learning services:\n\n(i) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider rulemaking to improve access to home- and community-based services under Medicaid. As part of any such rulemaking, the Secretary shall consider taking steps to support provider participation in Medicaid home- and community-based programs.\n\n(ii) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue policies that would support child care providers to give families more options to access high-quality child care providers, and shall update payment practices to improve provider stability and supply.\n\n(iii) The Secretary of Education shall update a guide for schools and districts to expand high-quality early learning programming using Federal funds so that more preschoolers are fully prepared to succeed in school.\n\n(iv) The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall identify and disseminate evidence-based practices for serving children with disabilities and their families in high-quality early childhood education programs, including Head Start. The Secretaries shall also take steps to ensure that services are inclusive of children with disabilities and their families; highlight any resources that are available to aid in that effort, including for preschool-aged children with disabilities under section 619 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families under Part C of the IDEA; and provide information to support all early childhood programs in meeting their obligations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\n(v) The Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is encouraged to consider developing financial guidance resources that support families during their care planning.\n\n(vi) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps to streamline processes for Tribes to use CCDF and Head Start funding to construct and improve facilities, including facilities that are jointly funded.\n\n(vii) The 12 agencies that signed the October 2022 Memorandum of Agreement to implement Public Law 102-477 (the “Tribal 477 Program”) shall increase the effectiveness of Tribal employment and training programs to ensure child care can be used as a support for families by reducing and streamlining administrative requirements, including through consolidation of budgeting, reporting, and auditing systems.\n\n(b) To expand options for quality home- and community-based services to veterans:\n\n(i) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider expanding the existing Veteran Directed Care Program — which provides veterans who need help with daily living with a budget to spend on home- and community-based services including personal care services — to all Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers by the end of Fiscal Year 2024, and shall consider developing an implementation plan for this expansion by June 2023.\n\n(ii) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider designing and evaluating a pilot program in no fewer than five veteran sites or in five States for a new Co-Employer Option for delivering veteran home health services. Features of the program may include allowing veterans to choose who provides their care and to determine when and how that care is delivered, and connecting veterans with a third-party agency that would help coordinate administrative tasks and act as an intermediary between veterans and their home health workers. Should the Department of Veterans Affairs implement this pilot program, it shall provide an implementation plan — including cost estimates and evaluation strategy — to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, before August 31, 2023.\n\n(iii) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider expanding the Home-Based Primary Care program by adding 75 new interdisciplinary teams to provide care to veterans in their homes.\n\n(c) To increase the supply of providers and options for families by encouraging greater private financial protection, support, and technical assistance for care providers:\n\n(i) the Secretary of the Treasury shall consider providing information to and sharing industry best practices with Community Development Financial Institutions to facilitate capital flows and support to care providers;\n\n(ii) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration is encouraged to consider publishing a guide on how individuals in the care workforce may start and sustainably operate care businesses locally and through Small Business Administration programming; and\n\n(iii) the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is encouraged to consider issuing guidance addressing financial institution practices that may increase the burden on the care workforce, discourage their work, and harm their financial well-being.\n\n(d) To build the capacity of local communities to better coordinate and deliver care:\n\n(i) the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall review existing policies to identify opportunities — including among Tribal communities — to increase the capacity of community care entities by providing operational support to these networks of providers; and\n\n(ii) the Secretary of Agriculture shall use the Rural Partners Network and issue guidance developed in partnership with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote opportunities — including by hosting workshops — to increase access to child care and long-term care in rural and Tribal communities.\n\n(e) To make the delivery and design of Federal care assistance and programs work better for families, the care workforce, and people seeking care, the Secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Veterans Affairs shall consider — and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration is encouraged to consider — prioritizing engagement with parents, guardians, and other relatives with care responsibilities; individuals receiving long-term care; State and local care experts; care providers and workers; employers; and labor unions.\n\nSec. 5. General Provisions.

Today’s final rule includes definitions of private equity and real estate investment trusts, setting the stage for identifying whether a nursing home belongs to one of these types of owners. These actions continue to build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwavering commitment to improving the safety and quality of care in the nation’s nursing homes and President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. Earlier this year, CMS and HHS also proposed a rule in September to establish national minimum staffing standards for nursing homes to enhance the quality and safety of care.\n\n“HHS continues to take action to improve the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing homes,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that residents living in nursing homes should receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. Taking steps to help consumers to learn more about the owners of a nursing home will allow them to make the choice that best meets their needs.”\n\n“CMS is committed to leveraging our tools to improve safety and quality of care in nursing homes, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “By strengthening our ability to examine nursing home ownership, including private equity and real estate investment trusts, we can improve transparency for the people we serve and their loved ones, researchers, and regulators, and enable better informed decisions about nursing home care.”\n\nThe final rule requires nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding their owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes will disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes. Nursing homes will also be required to disclose entities that exercise financial control over the facility, such as an organization the nursing home hires to manage all of its financial matters.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or supports within a facility, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. That will change under this rule. The final rule also requires additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nConcerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011, and the sector continues to attract robust sales.\n\nThe number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016, generously outpacing that of hospitals. Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership – four times more than hospitals. Nursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes, and in the two to three years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%. Private equity ownership of nursing homes may also lead to an uptick in Medicare costs. Additionally, the 10 largest nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes — a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule will be public, allowing families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones. This will also enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nFor a fact sheet on the final nursing home ownership disclosure rule, visit: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/disclosures-ownership-and-additional-disclosable-parties-information-skilled-nursing-facilities-and-0\n\nFor the ASPE report on nursing home ownership and quality trends, visit:\n\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/nh-ownership-its-implications-quality-availability-care.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/health/nursing-home-staffing-cms.html', 'Headline': 'Federal Officials Propose New Nursing Home Standards to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'The nation’s most thinly staffed nursing homes would be required to hire more workers under new rules proposed on Friday by the Biden administration, the greatest change to federal nursing home ...', 'Full_text': 'The nation’s most thinly staffed nursing homes would be required to hire more workers under new rules proposed on Friday by the Biden administration, the greatest change to federal nursing home regulations in three decades.\n\nThe proposed standard was prompted by the industry’s troubled performance earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, when 200,000 nursing home residents died. But the proposal falls far short of what both the industry and patient advocates believe is needed to improve care for most of the 1.2 million Americans in nursing homes.\n\nThe proposal, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would require all facilities to increase staff up to certain minimum levels, but it included no money for nursing homes to pay for the new hires.\n\nC.M.S. estimated that three-quarters of the nation’s 15,000 homes would need to add staff members. But the increases at many of those facilities would be minor, as the average nursing home already employs nurses and aides at, or very close to, the proposed levels.\n\n“The standards are a lot lower than what a lot of experts, including myself, have called for over the years,” said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. “There are some real positives in here, but I wish the administration had gone further.”\n\nThe government said it would exempt nursing homes from punishment if they could prove that there was a local worker shortage and that the facilities had made sincere efforts to recruit employees.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The AFL-CIO and SEIU, which both represent nursing home workers, lauded the Biden administration\'s plans.\n\n""Nursing home workers and residents have suffered unspeakable consequences,"" SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry says in a statement. She calls the proposal ""bold reform"" that gives hope to the ""woman-of-color-powered nursing home workforce"" for better, safer working conditions ahead.\n\nThe specific proposals are:\n\nNursing homes should have at least one registered nurse working 24/7.\n\nEach patient should be guaranteed 33 minutes of a nurse\'s time each day.\n\nEvery resident should have about 2.5 hours of a certified nursing assistant\'s care every day.\n\nThere should be at least one certified nursing assistant for every 10 residents.\n\nThe modest-sounding measures, nonetheless, would require more than 75% of nursing homes in the U.S. to hire additional staff, according to the administration.\n\nAnd that\'s a big problem, nursing home industry representatives say.\n\n""There are simply no people to hire — especially nurses,"" says Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit nursing homes and other aging services providers. ""It\'s meaningless to mandate staffing levels that cannot be met.""\n\nIn a statement, Sloan says immigration reform is needed to grow the workforce, and her members need better reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid. She predicted the mandates could close nonprofit nursing homes. Nonprofit nursing homes have been at a competitive disadvantage as large for-profits chains have come to dominate the industry in recent years.\n\nDespite union enthusiasm, Biden\'s effort is being called inadequate to protect seniors, even by some in his own party.\n\n""After repeated delays spurred by industry influence, we have a weak and disappointing proposal that does little to improve the quality of care or stop the mistreatment of nursing home staff,"" Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Texas, says in a statement.\n\nDoggett pointed out that the hours of care proposed are lower than what was recommended when the issue was last studied more than 20 years ago.\n\nBut those guidelines of 20 years ago were optional, and AARP, the organization representing older Americans, cheered this move toward an enforceable standard. ""The lack of standards and poor-quality care in too many of America\'s nursing homes is deadly,"" Nancy LeaMond, AARP\'s chief advocacy officer, says in a statement.

The proposed rule would require each resident get 33 minutes of care a day from a registered nurse. It also would mandate that at least one RN be working at a facility 24 hours a day. For nurse\'s aides, the care hours recommended are 2.45 hours per resident per day, a total below what was studied in the research referenced in this story. The comment period for the proposed rule goes until Nov. 6.\n\nThe Biden administration last year promised to establish minimum staffing levels for the nation\'s roughly 15,000 nursing homes. It was the centerpiece of an agenda to overhaul an industry the government said was rife with substandard care and failures to follow federal quality rules.\n\nBut a research study the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services commissioned to identify the appropriate level of staffing made no specific recommendations and analyzed only staffing levels lower than what the previous major federal evaluation had considered best, according to a copy of the study reviewed this week by KFF Health News. Instead, the new study said there was no single staffing level that would guarantee quality care, although the report estimated that higher staffing levels would lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, faster care, and fewer failures to provide care.\n\nPatient advocates said the report was the latest sign that the administration would fall short of its pledge to establish robust staffing levels to protect the 1.2 million Americans in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nResidents at risk\n\nAlready, the administration is six months behind its self-imposed deadline of February to propose new rules. Those proposals, which have not been released, were under evaluation from May until this week by the Office of Management and Budget. The study, dated June 2023, has not been formally released either, but a copy was posted on the CMS website. It was taken down shortly after KFF Health News published this article.\n\n""It\'s honestly heartbreaking,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for nursing home patients in New York state. ""I just don\'t see how this doesn\'t ultimately put more residents at risk of neglect and abuse. Putting the government\'s imprimatur on a standard that is patently unsafe is going to make it much more difficult for surveyors to hold facilities accountable for the harm caused by understaffing nursing homes.""\n\nFor months, the nursing home industry has been lobbying strenuously against a uniform ratio of patients to nurses and aides. ""What is clear as you look across the country is every nursing home is unique and a one-size-fits-all approach does not work,"" said Holly Harmon, senior vice president of quality, regulatory, and clinical services at the American Health Care Association, an industry trade group.\n\nGrueling work, low pay\n\nNursing home groups have emphasized the widespread difficulty in finding workers willing to fill existing certified nursing assistant jobs, which are often grueling and pay less than what workers can make at retail stores. Homes say their licensed nurses are often drawn away by other jobs, such as better-paying hospital positions. ""The workforce challenges are real,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association that represents nonprofit nursing homes.\n\nThe industry has also argued that if the government wants it to hire more workers it needs to increase the payments it makes through state Medicaid programs, which are the largest payor for nursing home care. Advocates and some researchers have argued that nursing homes, particularly for-profit ones, can afford to pay employees more and hire additional staff if they forsake some of the profits they give investors.\n\n""Certainly, facilities haven\'t put all the dollars back into direct care over the years,"" said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""But for certain facilities, it\'s going to be a big lift to pay for"" higher staffing levels, he said in an interview last week.\n\nWidely anticipated study\n\nIn a written statement to KFF Health News, Jonathan Blum, CMS\' principal deputy administrator and chief operating officer, said the study had been posted in error.\n\n""CMS is committed to holding nursing homes accountable for protecting the health and safety of all residents, and adequate staffing is critical to this effort,"" he said. ""CMS\'s proposal is being developed using a rigorous process that draws on a wide range of source information, including extensive input from residents and their families, workers, administrators, experts, and other stakeholders. Our focus is on advancing implementable solutions that promote safe, quality care for residents.""\n\nBlum\'s statement called the study a ""draft,"" although nothing in the 478-page study indicated it was preliminary.\n\nThe study has been widely anticipated, both because of the central role the administration said it would play in its policy and because the last major CMS study, conducted in 2001, had concluded that nursing home care improves as staffing increases up to the level of about one worker for every six residents. The formal metric for that staffing level was 4.1 staff hours per resident per day, which is calculated by dividing the number of total hours worked by nurses and aides on duty daily by the number of residents present each day.\n\nCMS never adopted that staffing ratio and instead gave each nursing home discretion to determine a reasonable staffing level. Regulators rarely cite nursing homes for insufficient staffing, even though independent researchers have concluded low staffing is the root of many nursing home injuries. Too few nurse aides, for instance, often means immobile residents are not repositioned in bed, causing bedsores that can lead to infection. Low staffing also is often responsible for indignities residents face, such as being left in soiled bedsheets for hours.\n\n\'Sabotaged\'\n\nThe new research was conducted by Abt Associates, a regular contractor for CMS that also performed the 2001 study. But the report, in an implicit disagreement with its predecessor, concluded there was ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or \'cliff\' below which quality and safety steeply decline."" Abt referred questions about the study to CMS.\n\nThe study evaluated four minimum staffing levels, all of which were below the 4.1 daily staff hours that the prior study had identified as ideal. The highest was 3.88 daily staff hours. At that level, the study estimated 0.6% of residents would get delayed care and 0.002% would not get needed care. It also said that staffing level would result in 12,100 fewer hospitalizations of Medicare residents and 14,800 fewer emergency room visits. The report said three-quarters of nursing homes would need to add staff to meet that level and that it would cost $5.3 billion extra each year.\n\nThe lowest staffing level the report analyzed was 3.3 daily staffing hours. At that level, the report said, 3.3% of residents would get delayed care and 0.04% would not get needed care. That level would reduce hospitalizations of Medicare residents by 5,800 and lead to 4,500 fewer emergency room visits. More than half of nursing homes would have to increase staff levels to meet that ratio, the report said, and it would cost $1.5 billion more each year.\n\nCharlene Harrington, a professor emeritus of nursing at the University of California-San Francisco, said CMS ""sabotaged"" the push for sufficiently high staffing through the instructions it gave its contractor. ""Every threshold they looked at was below 4.1,"" she said. ""How can that possibly be a decent study? It\'s just unacceptable.""'}}",100.0,2

However, what is making waves is a whistleblower named Brook Jackson. She claims that in September 2020, when she was hired to oversee the testing of a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer, criminal fraud occurred, allowing the vaccine to be FDA-approved.\n\nThe questions which have been asked the most since these allegations became public are:\n\nWhat criminal fraud was committed?\n\nIs there anything mentioned in the lawsuit that could be deemed criminal fraud?\n\nAre there holes in Ms. Jackson's claims?\n\nWhile there are issues with mishandling biohazard materials during the testing process, is that enough to constitute a data integrity breach?\n\nYou might find the issues brought up by Professor Dorit Rubenstein Reiss of the University of California Hastings College of Law quite interesting. Do you think that Reiss has created massive holes in the claims stated by Ms. Jackson? As far as we can tell, Jackson or her legal team has not addressed these holes. You can read them here.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that just because Jackson or her legal team has not addressed the holes does not mean they are legit.\n\nOthers have wondered why Ms. Jackson went to BMJ.com to break the story, a UK company instead of one in the US. Was no media outlet willing to break the story because they felt it lacked objective evidence?\n\nHow much does it pay to sue Big Pharma? A lot. If the government intervenes, the relator (the official designation of the whistleblower) can expect 15-25% of the amount the government recovers. The highest recorded payout to a whistleblower is $32 million. And if the government agrees with Jackson, her payout could be substantially more.\n\nThe Key Players\n\nPfizer Inc. - is the manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine as safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 for individuals 12 or older. The vaccine is currently marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA ruled no problem with the data submitted, and no criminal fraud was committed.\n\nVentavia Research Group (VRG) - The independent lab tested the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. According to their website, they have eight locations in Texas: Houston, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, Keller, Burleson, Weatherford, and Grapevine. They have just under 100 employees and have performed clinical trial research since 2013.\n\nThe FDA has not taken any action against Ventavia and fully accepted the data from the vaccine testing performed at Ventavia facilities. Wouldn't it make sense if there was an actual problem that the FDA would have taken action? But they didn't.\n\nBrook Jackson - Known as The COVID-19 Pfizer Whistleblower who reported her findings to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Jackson states she has audio recordings and copies of company documents backing up her claims about how VRG conducted the vaccine trial.\n\nOne photo allegedly shows needles used in the vaccine trial had been discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of the approved sharps container box. It is unclear if the used needles were poking through the plastic bag creating a potential injury to anyone handling the bag or near it. Another photo shows the potential of unblinding the participants as the completed vaccine packing materials contained the trial participants' identification numbers, which were out in the open instead of in a secured location.\n\nDoes this sound like criminal fraud to you? Does it paint a picture of a lack of training? Yes. How about that when overworked employees often make mistakes they wouldn't under normal circumstances? That would be probable.\n\nPaul Thacker - the reporter responsible for breaking the story, is described as an American journalist who has reported on science, medicine, and the environment. He has just 16k followers on Twitter. Does that seem like a lot to you? And according to Science.org, fake news is shared 70% more often on Twitter than real news.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/pfizer-defeats-whistleblower-suit-over-covid-19-clinical-trial-2', 'Headline': 'Pfizer Defeats Whistleblower Suit Over Covid-19 Clinical Trial', 'Snippet': 'Whistleblower claims that Pfizer defrauded the government while developing its Covid-19 vaccine have been dismissed with prejudice in Texas.

Pfizer was entitled to its claims for payment. Therefore, Ms. Jackson has not stated a claim for false record liability.”\n\nJackson described Judge Truncale’s decision as a “blueprint” on how government contractors can “commit fraud and get away with it. She and her lawyers said they will appeal the dismissal.\n\nJudge: FCA not created to ‘second-guess’ federal policymakers\n\nJudge Truncale said the FCA places the onus on the federal government to determine whether it had been defrauded.\n\nHe quoted another ruling finding that the FCA was not created to “second guess decisions made by those empowered through the democratic process to shape public policy.”\n\n“When the government, at appropriate levels, repeatedly concludes that it has not been defrauded, it is not forgiving a found fraud — rather, it is concluding that there was no fraud at all,” that ruling went on to state.\n\nThis very argument was put forward by Pfizer during the case. As quoted by The Epoch Times, Judge Truncale asked the defense, “So if the FDA gets it wrong, they just get it wrong, and we live with it?”\n\nTo this, Pfizer attorney Carlton Wessel replied, “Exactly.”\n\nJudge Truncale noted that the federal government has been aware of Jackson’s claims “for several years,” but despite this, granted an EUA “multiple times” and “continues to authorize and provide Pfizer’s vaccine at no cost.”\n\nHe also noted that Jackson’s complaint did not “identify any safety risk that was hidden from the FDA.”\n\nA 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded the scope of a legal principle known as “materiality” resulted in a series of federal court decisions in which fraud cases brought under the FCA were dismissed.\n\nAs interpreted by the Supreme Court, if the government continued paying a contractor despite the contractor’s fraudulent activity, the fraud was not considered “material” to the contract.\n\nThe FCA also allows whistleblowers to file claims on the basis of harassment, retaliation and threats if they are engaged in a “protected activity,” defined as being “motivated by a concern regarding fraud against the government.”\n\nIt is this aspect of Jackson’s claim that will be allowed to proceed on appeal.\n\nVentavia hired Jackson in September 2020. She reported problems she observed with the Pfizer vaccine trial to the company’s management that same month. When management didn’t respond, she took her claims to the FDA on Sept. 25, 2020. Ventavia fired her that same day.\n\nJudge Truncale ruled that Jackson had not engaged in protected activity under the standard set by the FCA, but left open the possibility that she could file a retaliation claim under a different statute.\n\nPfizer previously was heavily fined in connection with the FCA. As part of a 2009 settlement, the company paid $2.3 billion in fines — the largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice — stemming from allegations of illegal marketing of off-label products not approved by the FDA.\n\nIn an attempt to strengthen the FCA’s anti-retaliation provisions and install new safeguards against industry-level blacklisting of whistleblowers seeking employment, Congress in July 2021 introduced the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, Pfizer hired a well-connected lobbyist, Hazen Marshall, and the law firm Williams & Jensen to lobby against the bill, which ultimately faltered in Congress.\n\nA new bill, the Administrative False Claims Act of 2023 (S.659), was filed as part of the current Congressional session, sponsored by Sen.

Truncale’s Beaumont, Texas, courtroom on March 1, 2023, to hear Pfizer’s motion to dismiss the False Claims Act case Jackson filed against the pharmaceutical giant on behalf of the United States. Depending on Truncale’s ruling, the case could further expose the enormous fraud and deception between Pfizer and the U.S. government as the billionaire company cut corners and wasted taxpayer money to get its experimental COVID-19 gene therapy jabs into the arms of society. While the world awaits Truncale’s ruling on whether the case will move forward with discovery or be dismissed altogether, as Pfizer hopes, Jackson’s attorney Robert Barnes summed up what is undoubtedly the belief held by any American paying attention, tweeting:\n\n“Pfizer promised to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for prevention of COVID based on honest clinical data. Instead, they delivered a dangerous, ineffective gene therapy, preventing nothing. Pfizer lied. People died. Time for discovery.”\n\nJudge Truncale, appointed in 2019, allowed nearly four hours of oral arguments last Wednesday in the case, which centers around revelations of shoddy practices at Ventavia, a contract research company hired to carry out Pfizer’s pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial before the FDA’s issued its Emergency Use Authorization. Truncale noted that he would not issue a ruling from the bench. As of March 6, a decision has yet to be handed down, and according to Barnes, Truncale’s written opinion could take weeks or even months, depending on how long it takes the court to review the case. Barnes explained that the court expressed concern that the net effect of Pfizer’s argument could be “that there’s no role for the judiciary in overseeing what takes place if the FDA simply continues along with the Pfizer fraud.”\n\nTrying to shift responsibility for any wrongdoing, Defense attorneys argued that even if protocol violations occurred, the case should not move forward because the federal government was aware “but still granted emergency authorization to Pfizer’s vaccine.” Racing to beat Moderna as the first pharmaceutical company to unveil an EUA mRNA injection, the billion-dollar company’s attorneys tried to minimize the magnitude of Jackson’s complaints, asserting that “even if rules were violated, the problems only affected a small number of trial sites.” Astounded by Pfizer’s defense, Barnes explained the company’s extraordinary arrogance and untouchable attitude—remember, they have special immunity thanks to the PREP Act—sharing with Owen Shroyer:\n\n“Pfizer’s defense was not that these allegations are false. They challenge whether the allegations are true, but at this stage of the pleadings, they have to assume them to be true legally. Their argument was solely that even if they created a dangerous, ineffective drug that they disguised as a vaccine that they said would be for the prevention of COVID-19, that didn’t prevent COVID at all—in fact, in some cases, it appears the infection rate goes up with COVID depending on how many booster shots that you’ve had—that none of that matters. They argue that as long as the Biden administration, the Justice Department, the FDA, and the Department of Defense go along with this scam, nobody can ever hold them accountable.\n\nThe only way to hold them accountable is the Brook Jackson suit.”\n\nJackson, who has dedicated nearly twenty years to helping get safe and effective therapeutics, vaccines, and devices to consumers, began working for Ventavia on September 8, 2020. Her primary responsibility was overseeing Pfizer’s Phase 3 COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” trial at several locations in Texas. With no reason to initially doubt anything about Pfizer’s drug product or trial, Jackson took her job seriously and was shocked at the poor laboratory management at Ventavia, which calls itself the largest privately owned research company in Texas. Jackson documented several matters of concern, including needles sticking out of bags and vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants. Moreover, with doctored data throughout the trial, participants with severe adverse reactions were ignored, also against protocol. With the agreement for Pfizer to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, Barnes highlighted the clinical trial atrocities, explaining:\n\n“It was supposed to be a randomized test. It wasn’t. It was supposed to be a placebo-controlled test. It wasn’t. It was supposed to be a blinded clinical trial. It wasn’t. All the data was doctored, and the data, in many ways, was fabricated or falsified.”\n\nPointing out Pfizer’s incredibly well-constructed deception, Barnes explained that certifications were fraudulent, invoices were bogus, and Pfizer further argued that it didn’t have to comply with the FDA rules, which is untrue and was rightly pointed out by Judge Truncale in Wednesday’s hearing. According to Barnes, Pfizer’s contract clearly states that it must follow FDA rules and regulations throughout the entire process. And most importantly, as previously noted, the contract Pfizer signed with the DoD states at least “half a dozen times” that Pfizer will deliver “a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.” A task at which the company failed miserably.\n\nWith mounting evidence underlining the extreme measures Pfizer took to deceive the American people as the Biden administration stood by and watched, Barnes hinted that he thinks the next wave of potential litigation against Pfizer and Moderna will be centered around the fact they lied to their shareholders. Barnes pointed out that just as Pfizer and Moderna lied to the Trump Defense Department by stating they would deliver a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, the pharma giants also told their shareholders the same thing. Yet, the vaccine is neither safe nor effective. According to Barnes, that’s fraud on the market, which is one place Pfizer and Moderna have no immunity. Summarizing how perhaps Pfizer is starting to feel the heat, Barnes explained:\n\n“Right now, they’re begging the court not to allow any discovery to occur in this case. They argue that no court process should be allowed and that no jury should be allowed to hear the case. They made this argument explicitly. In fact, what they said is, ‘once the FDA says something, judge, you judge, have no more power to say a single thing about this. You, the jury has no more power to say a single thing about this.’ [Which is] directly contrary to the False Claims Act.\n\nAnd the key is if this fraud is exposed, that opens the door for them to be held accountable across the board.”\n\n148,797 total views, 19 views today'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/judge-evidence-pfizer-whistleblower-lawsuit/', 'Headline': 'Judge Unseals 400 Pages of Evidence, Clears Way for Pfizer ...', 'Snippet': 'A whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraud during Pfizer’s COVID vaccine trials is moving forward, after a district court judge unsealed the complaint, including 400 pages of exhibits..

The lawsuit includes several charges of fraud and retaliation on the part of both Ventavia and Pfizer.\n\nThe complaint remained under seal until Feb. 10, when U.S. District Court Judge Michael Truncale ordered it unsealed.\n\nPfizer ‘deliberately withheld crucial information’ about vaccine’s safety\n\nAccording to Jackson’s lawsuit, Pfizer, Ventavia and ICON “deliberately withheld crucial information from the United States that calls the safety and efficacy of their vaccine into question.”\n\nThe lawsuit states:\n\n“Defendants concealed violations of both their clinical trial protocol and federal regulations, including falsification of clinical trial documents.\n\n“Due to [the] Defendants’ scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented.”\n\nThe core allegations of Jackson’s lawsuit include claims against Ventavia and Pfizer of:\n\nMaking or using false records or statements to cause claims to be paid.\n\nPresentation of false and/or fraudulent claims.\n\nMaking or using false records or statements material to false and/or fraudulent claims.\n\nRetaliation.\n\nFor instance, Jackson alleges:\n\n“From 2020 to the present, Defendants [Ventavia and Pfizer] knowingly made, used, or caused to be made or used, false records or statements that were material to false and/or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the United States [Department of Defense, or DoD]. These false records or statements include the clinical trial protocol Pfizer submitted to the United States and the falsified source documents and data behind Defendants’ trial results and EUA application.\n\n“By creating and carrying out their fraudulent schemes, Defendants knowingly and repeatedly violated … the False Claims Act. Defendants’ false records were material to Pfizer’s claims for payment for the vaccine at issue. The United States DoD would not have paid Pfizer if it knew that the clinical trial protocol was not complied with by Defendants, because the protocol violations call the integrity and validity of both the entire clinical trial and Pfizer’s EUA into question.\n\n“Defendants’ false records also went to the very essence of the bargain the United States contracted for. DoD contracted to purchase vaccines found effective by a valid clinical trial conducted according to the protocol submitted by Pfizer. The integrity of the entire clinical trial was compromised by the trial protocol violations, false source documents, and the false data that resulted, which calls the vaccine’s EUA into question. Had the United States DoD known of Defendants’ false records, it would not have paid Pfizer.\n\n“Defendants’ use, or causation of use, of material false records was a foreseeable factor in the United States DoD’s loss and a consequence of Defendants’ schemes. By virtue of Defendants’ actions, the United States DoD has suffered actual damages and is entitled to recover treble damages plus a civil monetary penalty for each false and/or fraudulent claim.”\n\nJackson is requesting damages, including back pay, in addition to reinstatement of her position with Ventavia.\n\nVentavia, which describes itself as the largest privately owned clinical research company in Texas, operated several sites where clinical trials were taking place on behalf of Pfizer.\n\nJackson, a regional director for Ventavia, was hired by the company when Pfizer contracted with it to conduct its phase 3 vaccine trial.\n\nJackson, who possessed over 15 years’ worth of experience working with clinical trials, “repeatedly informed her superiors of poor laboratory management, patient safety concerns and data integrity issues” during the approximately two weeks she was employed by Ventavia.\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2020, Jackson emailed the FDA, listing a dozen concerns she said she had witnessed. These included:\n\nLack of timely follow-up for patients who experienced adverse events from the trial.\n\nProtocol deviations that went unreported.\n\nRetaliation against and targeting of Ventavia employees who reported such problems.\n\nTrial participants being placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff.\n\nVaccines not being stored at proper temperatures.\n\nWrongly labeled laboratory specimens.\n\nJackson provided documents indicating falsified data, blind trial failures and awareness on the part of at least one Ventavia executive that members of the company’s staff were “falsifying data.”\n\nJackson’s documents also provided evidence of administrators who had “no training” or medical certifications, or who provided “very little oversight” during the trials.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It’s Free!\n\nName*\n\nFirst Last\n\nEmail*\n\nHidden\n\nSource\n\nEmail\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nΔ\n\nSeveral internal company emails would be copied to a Pfizer official, who would respond to some of the correspondence.\n\nThe documentation provided by Jackson also demonstrated that she had discussed with Ventavia executives the possibility of the FDA conducting an unannounced inspection. The executives were described as “dreading” such a possibility.\n\nAccording to Jackson, she received an acknowledgment email from the FDA and a follow-up phone call from an FDA inspector, but no further communication.\n\nVentavia fired her within hours of her contacting the FDA.\n\nVentavia executive on Pfizer vaccine trial: ‘cleanup on aisle five’\n\nAs reported by investigative journalist Matt Taibbi, a recording of a Ventavia executive revealed the individual in question referred to the problems with the vaccine trial as “cleanup on aisle five” and that this same executive pressed Jackson as to whether she had revealed information to outsiders.\n\nThis led Jackson to contact The BMJ, which in November 2021 published an article based on the evidence she had provided highlighting Ventavia’s repeated failures.\n\nJournalist Paul Thacker, who had previously investigated financial ties between “Big Pharma” and physicians for the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, wrote The BMJ article.\n\nIn November 2020, Ventavia appeared to have confirmed its knowledge of problems that occurred with the vaccine trial, and claimed that it would conduct an investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Pfizer continued its relationship with Ventavia, hiring it as a research subcontractor for at least four other trials, including trialing the COVID vaccine for children, young adults, pregnant women and the safety of a booster dose.\n\nThe FDA, despite knowledge of the allegations against Pfizer and Ventavia, went ahead and granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, including for children 5 to 11 years old.\n\nThe FDA in August 2021 stated that it inspected only nine of the trial’s 153 sites. None of Ventavia’s sites were included. (A 2007 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found the FDA inspected only 1% of clinical trial sites).\n\nVentavia went on the offensive against Jackson, claiming that:\n\n“Ms. Jackson worked for us for only 18 days and, as a result, did not complete the requisite training for the role for which she was hired. We are confident in our practices and procedures in conducting clinical trials, and, should her case move forward, we will respond to the litigation accordingly.”\n\nVentavia later, in a Feb. 11 statement, modified its claims about Jackson, writing:\n\n“Although Jackson was hired to oversee certain sites and aspects of clinical trials, she was only employed with Ventavia for 18 days, and, as a result, did not have the longevity with the company to complete the training for the role for which she was hired.”\n\nHowever, according to Thacker, “[s]everal documents show that Jackson worked on Pfizer’s clinical trial.” These documents include a clinical trial delegation log which lists Jackson as a participant.\n\nAlso, according to Thacker, dozens of media organizations also failed to issue retractions of their reports which alleged Jackson had no direct involvement with the vaccine trials.\n\nJackson threatened to file a separate defamation lawsuit against Ventavia over its characterization of her employment.\n\nThe BMJ, in turn, was targeted for publishing the report. Facebook throttled the report and issued warnings to its users not to share it, following a report by one of the company’s contracted “fact checkers,” Lead Stories, claiming the report would not “disqualify” the overall trial of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nLead Stories went so far as to describe The BMJ as a “blog.”\n\nThe BMJ said that it is “considering all available options” in terms of a potential legal claim against Facebook, which recently admitted in a court of law that its “fact checks” are “pure opinion.”\n\nFeds won’t intervene in whistleblower case … for now\n\nThe documents pertaining to Jackson’s lawsuit were released after U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys declined to intervene on her behalf in the case.\n\nThe DOJ filed a “notice of election to decline intervention,” asking the court to get “written consent” in the event the parties to the lawsuit wish to dismiss or settle the case.\n\nThe government also reserved the right to intervene at a later date.\n\nNeither the DOJ lawyers nor the FDA offered an explanation for why the DOJ chose not to intervene.\n\nJackson said that she was not surprised the federal government opted not to intervene, but expressed her “total disappointment,” adding that “[w]e’re going to pursue the case without the help of the government.”\n\nWhile Jackson has stated her belief that the likelihood of her case succeeding is low, she also said that “[i]t’s just a chance I have to take. I just feel like somebody has to be held accountable.”\n\nVentavia also remarked upon the government’s refusal to intervene. Lauren Foreman, the company’s director of business development and communications, wrote in an email to Just the News, “[w]e are gratified the government has declined the case.”\n\nJackson apparently lost her original Texas-based lawyers in October 2021, but was able to attain new legal representation in December 2021, headed by Los Angeles-based attorney Robert Barnes.\n\nThe federal government’s refusal to intervene comes in contrast to the FDA welcoming Pfizer’s offer to intervene in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit filed against the agency. A federal judge ruled Pfizer must disclose redacted versions of nearly 400,000 pages of documents pertaining to its issuance of an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThe FDA claimed it could not release the documents at a fast enough rate to meet the demands of the court or the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nPfizer then asked the court to intervene, ostensibly to “help” the FDA with the process of releasing the documents.\n\nA federal court rejected Pfizer’s bid to intervene.\n\nPfizer lobbies to limit False Claims Act\n\nJackson’s primary lawsuit against Pfizer, Ventavia and ICON pertains to the False Claims Act — a piece of legislation dating back to the Civil War which rewards whistleblowers who file anti-fraud lawsuits against contractors on behalf of the government.\n\nThe law, originally enacted in response to defense contractor fraud during the Civil War, has to date returned $67 billion to the U.S. government.\n\nWhile the False Claims Act has been in place since the Civil War, it was significantly eroded by a 2016 Supreme Court decision, Universal Health Services v. United States, which found a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act could be dismissed if the contractor in question continued to be paid by the government.\n\nThis resulted in a series of federal court decisions in which fraud cases were dismissed, while the DOJ, via its 2018 Granston Memo, instructed government attorneys to reject more False Claims Act lawsuits.\n\nIn the two years that followed, dismissals of False Claims Act cases indeed increased.\n\nThe decision significantly expanded the scope of a legal principle known as “materiality.” As interpreted by the court, if the government continued paying a contractor despite the contractor’s fraudulent activity, then the fraud was not considered “material” to the contract.\n\nThe issue of materiality is a core component of Jackson’s lawsuit against Ventavia, Pfizer and ICON.\n\nProposed legislation, the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021, which was introduced in Congress in July 2021, would again bolster the law, strengthening the original law’s anti-retaliation provisions by installing new safeguards against industry-level blacklisting of whistleblowers seeking employment.\n\nThe proposed act also would adjust the materiality standard to include instances where government payments have continued despite knowledge of fraud.\n\nThis could affect Pfizer, which has contracts with the U.S. government to provide COVID vaccines.\n\nThe bill passed through committee by a 15-7 vote and was added to the Senate’s legislative calendar on Nov. 16, 2021. However, no action has been taken since.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, Pfizer hired a well-connected lobbyist, Hazen Marshall, and the law firm Williams & Jensen to lobby against the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021, as previously reported by The Defender.\n\nNotably, under the terms of a 2009 settlement, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in fines — the largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) — in a False Claims Act case stemming from allegations of illegal marketing of off-label products not approved by the FDA.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://citizenwells.substack.com/p/brook-jackson-whistleblower-lawsuit', 'Headline': 'Brook Jackson whistleblower lawsuit allegations against Ventavia Pfizer ...', 'Snippet': 'A lawsuit filed by whistleblower Brook Jackson alleging Pfizer and two of its contractors manipulated data and committed other acts of fraud during Pfizer’s COVID-19 clinical trials is paused following a motion by the defendants to dismiss the case..

Pfizer delegated management of the clinical trial to subcontractor Defendant Icon PLC (“Icon”), an Irish clinical research organization. Icon was tasked with oversight of over 160 test sites worldwide, ensuring trial protocol compliance, and ensuring reporting of required information. This includes oversight of Serious Adverse Event (“SAE”) reporting, which is required by the trial protocol and federal regulations. Pfizer remained responsible for managing and quality checking all data for the entire clinical trial, per the trial’s protocol.\n\n5. Defendant Ventavia Research Group, LLC (“Ventavia”) was contracted by Pfizer to provide three Phase 3 test sites for the vaccine trial in Houston, Fort Worth, and Keller, Texas. Ventavia ultimately enrolled about 1,500 clinical trial patients. Ventavia employed Relator Jackson as a Regional Director. She was tasked with overseeing site management, patient enrollment, quality assurance completion, event reporting, corrective action plan creation, communication with management, and staff training completion at the Keller and Fort Worth sites.\n\n6. Pfizer, aiming for the title of “first successful COVID-19 vaccine,” pushed Ventavia to enroll as many patients as possible in the vaccine trial as quickly as possible. Ventavia was compensated by Pfizer mainly on a per-patient basis—up to a weekly limit—and rushed to enroll as many clinical trial participants as possible per week. Ventavia’s race to maximize payment and over-booking of patients resulted in sloppy and fraudulent documentation practices, poor clinical trial protocol compliance, and little oversight. Pfizer and Icon turned a blind eye to Ventavia’s misconduct, despite numerous warning signs.\n\n7. Ventavia’s trial protocol and regulatory violations were so widespread, in fact, that Relator observed them on a near-daily basis during her brief employment period. For example,\n\nRelator observed:\n\n• fabrication and falsification of blood draw information, vital signs, signatures and other essential clinical trial data;\n\n• enrollment and injection of ineligible clinical trial participants, including Ventavia employees’ family members;\n\n• failure to timely remove ineligible patients’ data from the trial;\n\n• failure to maintain temperature control for the vaccine at issue;\n\n• failure to monitor patients after injection as required by the trial protocol;\n\n• principal investigator oversight failures;\n\n• use of unqualified and untrained personnel as vaccinators and laboratory personnel;\n\n• failure to maintain the “blind” as required, which is essential to the credibility and validity of the observer-blinded clinical trial;\n\n• ethical violations, such as failure to secure informed consent and giving patients unapproved compensation;\n\n• improper injection of the vaccine (i.e., by over-diluting vaccine concentrate or using the wrong needle size);\n\n• failure to ensure that trial site staff were properly trained as required by good clinical practices;\n\n• safety and confidentiality issues, including HIPAA violations; and\n\n• other violations of the clinical trial protocol, FDA regulations, and Federal Acquisition Regulations and their DoD supplements.\n\n8. Ventavia failed to report the majority of its clinical trial protocol and regulatory violations to Pfizer or the external Institutional Review Board.

The Epoch Times reported last week that Jackson\'s unnamed lawyer threatened to sue Ventavia for defamation based on its characterization of her employment.\n\n\'Cleanup on aisle five\'\n\nOn Feb. 10, U.S. District Judge Michael Truncale unsealed the January 2021 complaint and authorized Jackson to serve it on the defendants. Also made public: more than 400 pages of exhibits (1-10, 11-20, 20-29).\n\nThe Epoch Times, which posted the exhibits, said they show among other things that Pfizer was aware of the Ventavia problems. The FDA told the publication last year it has ""full confidence in the data that were used to support"" the emergency use authorization of Pfizer\'s vaccine and full approval of its branded vaccine Comirnaty.\n\nAt the request of the U.S., Truncale agreed to seal all other documents already in the court record but not those subsequently filed. Jackson, however, provided other non-public evidence to select journalists, including recordings of Ventavia meetings.\n\nPaul Thacker, who previously investigated financial ties between physicians and pharmaceutical companies for the Senate Finance Committee, published an investigation in the British Medical Journal last fall.\n\nIn one recording, executives reportedly say Ventavia is finding ""something new every day"" in trial paperwork errors and dreading a possible FDA site visit. Another clinical trial veteran told Thacker that Ventavia was a ""helter skelter"" work environment and its data were a ""crazy mess.""\n\nJournalist Matt Taibbi said he listened to a recording on which a Ventavia executive referred to its trial data problems as ""cleanup on aisle five"" and seemed to quiz Jackson about whether she had spilled the beans to outsiders.\n\nFacebook throttled the BMJ report and warned users not to share it because the social media company\'s contracted fact-checker, Lead Stories, claimed the reporting would not ""disqualify"" the overall Pfizer COVID vaccine trial. Asked about possible litigation, BMJ recently told Just the News it was ""considering all available options.""\n\nThacker told Just the News that he could tell Pfizer\'s public relations team was feeding questions to other journalists, based on the inquiries he got. If his reporting were unverified, Pfizer would have sicced its army of lawyers on him, he argued.\n\nD.C. lawyers know how careful he is, and he has more documentation than he has published, Thacker said.\n\nHe was primed to be skeptical of fact-checks by his previous BMJ investigation into how ""contemporary science journalism"" explained the wrongful designation of the COVID ""lab leak"" as a conspiracy theory for a year.\n\n""I thought it was a joke at first"" when Lead Stories faulted his report, which it erroneously described as a ""blog,"" Thacker said. The fact-checker subsequently defended itself by claiming the BMJ report was misleading readers and being promoted by anti-vaccine pundits, and that Jackson ""does not [personally] express unreserved support"" for COVID vaccines.\n\nLead Stories specifically faulted BMJ for leading the report with Pfizer and referring to the company throughout, even though it documented problems at Ventavia. That\'s because Pfizer repeatedly designated the trial as ""rigorous"" despite its familiarity with Ventavia\'s problems, Thacker told Just the News.\n\nHe characterized ""rigorous"" as a mindless buzzword to defend COVID vaccine reviews, used by acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock to approve Pfizer\'s vaccine for 5-11 year-olds.

""It\'s an old Eddie Murphy skit"" where a boyfriend caught cheating tells his girlfriend ""it wasn\'t me,"" Thacker said.\n\nOne of Jackson\'s claims is that Ventavia had too few employees to handle the volume of trial participants. Thacker said a second Ventavia whistleblower subsequently told him its trial actually had four times as many participants (4,000) as the company told the FDA in writing, roughly 10% of the total, but Thacker couldn\'t document this due to the alleged sloppiness of the data.\n\nHe\'s not sure about doing a followup on clinical trial problems despite having unpublished documentation.

Her job was to oversee its clinical trial of Pfizer’s not-yet-approved COVID-19 vaccine. She repeatedly told company officials of the breaches in protocol and other actions that compromised the study, but her protests were ignored.\n\n“I recognized fraud right away,” Brook said. “The staff at the company were forging patient consent forms. They were enrolling their own employees and family members in the study and allowing them to choose to get the actual vaccine, not the placebo. When the trials were supposed to be blinded, the company I worked for unblinded them.”\n\nBlowing the Whistle\n\nJust 18 days after starting her new job, Brook called the Food and Drug Administration to tell them about those incorrect actions leading to the study’s unblinding. Hours later, while working from home that day, she was fired by Ventavia, ostensibly because she wasn’t the “right fit.”\n\n“I’ve never been fired in my life,” said Brook, who’s been working in clinical research for 20 years.\n\nAt Ventavia, her job was to manage the daily operations of the Ventavia COVID-19 study, which involved 1,500 study participants. Right away, she found company officials were violating local, state, and federal laws and not putting patients’ interests ahead of making money.\n\nThe gold standard for clinical trials is for there to be blinding. This means participants do not know certain information about the trial—like whether they’re receiving the real treatment or placebo—and this reduces bias and the placebo effect. Unblinding trials effectively renders them useless, Brook noted. Such breaches of protocol also compromise patient treatments and patient safety.\n\n“If I’m your doctor and you’re in a study and I know you got the vaccine and you call me and say you have COVID symptoms, they use having had the vax as a default to rule out the possibility of you having COVID,” she said. “It injects a bias into the trial.”\n\nPfizer’s own protocol dictates that if there’s a potential for unblinding, the company controlling the trials should pause them and contact Pfizer, Brook explains. “Instead of reporting the potential unblinding, [Ventavia officials] sent a text message to the directors in the company to have them locate the info and destroy evidence of unblinding. … If Pfizer called Ventavia, we were told to tell Pfizer that all was fine and that we were just running behind schedule.”\n\nBut Brook’s findings regarding the trials so concerned her that in September 2020 she reported 14 findings she discovered in the Ventavia trials to the FDA.\n\n“Six hours later my company called and fired me,” she said, adding that she was surprised to be fired the way she was.\n\n“For 18 days I was telling them everything they were doing wrong. I spent my entire career making sure that the data in clinical trials was backed by good data,” Brook said.\n\nThe realization that her industry has been corrupted for a long time has been sobering for Brook. And she explains that over her life she has not been opposed to vaccines. “I’m not anti-vax,” she said. “I’m typically someone who would get the vaccine.”\n\n“It’s been very difficult for me to be the age I am and realize what the past 20 years of my life have been. I feel lost, I feel betrayed,” she said.\n\nBrook’s Lawsuit\n\nIn December 2020 when Pfizer was given the emergency use authorization for the vaccine by the U.S. government, Brook realized they’d used the Ventavia data she’d flagged as compromised. Now she’s suing for $1.9 billion on behalf of those injured by the vaccine.\n\n“I filed the lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. and its citizens because I know Pfizer used fraudulent data from those clinical trials to get the vaccine approved,” said Brook. “They shouldn’t have used the data from Ventavia to show the vaccine was effective or safe. Pfizer and the FDA ignored me in that they knew this fraudulent info was being used. They were in a rush to get this vaccine out and they wanted to be the first to market.”\n\nBeing from a military family, Brook has a deep love of her country. She believes integrity is important, and that’s why she couldn’t ignore the disregard for protocol, unblinding and dismissal of patients’ adverse COVID-19 vax reactions.\n\n“I knew this vaccine would be used throughout the world, and I wanted it to be effective and work and help people. … They weren’t even recording the adverse reactions that were being reported by patients. They were crapping all over procedures and protocols for a buck, and I couldn’t be quiet about that,” she said.\n\nThese days, we know the vaccines aren’t effective in preventing people from getting COVID and that the vax is causing myocarditis in men, she noted. “People who are being injured by the vaccine need to know how these trials were compromised,” she said.\n\nThe named parties in the lawsuit, including ICON, Pfizer, and Ventavia, all made motions to dismiss. In October 2022, the government supported Pfizer in the lawsuit, with a statement of interest saying the case should be dismissed due to the totality of the evidence.\n\n“They’re saying that because the trials I reported on were just 3% of the trials’ total 44,000 enrollees, that number is so small it’s insignificant,” Brook said. “Of that 44,000, only 170 patients developed COVID after getting the vax. And of that 170, they’re saying that 162 were in the placebo group, [so] eight were in the vaccinated group—that’s how they got 95% safe and effective.”\n\nPart of the problem Brook faces in her lawsuit is not just the intransigence of government officials but also their stupidity. The Department of Justice doesn’t understand how clinical trials should be run, she noted.\n\n“Of the 170 patients who tested positive for COVID in the Pfizer clinical trials, four of them were from Ventavia’s clinical trial sites. But 40 were from a site in Argentina that’s currently undergoing an international investigation for fraud in the trials there,” Brook said. “There’s no accountability—none.”\n\nBrook believes the mRNA platform that was used to develop the COVID-19 vaccines is being wrongly portrayed as an acceptable way to develop medicines to treat various illnesses.\n\n“So now, all of a sudden mRNA is a platform to bring these previously failed vaccines forward. … It’s scary,” she said.\n\nAfter being fired by Ventavia, it took Brook a year to find another job. But when people learned of her lawsuit, strange things started happening to her. She’d lose connectivity on her computer, hear crackling sounds while talking on the phone, had a box of crickets set on her doorstep, and got an already-opened letter from the Department of Justice in her mailbox (the letter was a notice declining part of her lawsuit).\n\nHeart-Wrenching and Uplifting Moments\n\nAt a roundtable discussion for vaccine-injured advocates in November 2021 organized by Senator Ron Johnson, the testimonies transformed Brook.\n\n“As I listened to the vaccine injured tell their stories, it changed me and my life forever in ways I can’t explain,” Brook said. “I am from a military family, and I still want to believe in my country. You have these codes and regulations, and they must be followed.”\n\nReading about or even hearing over the phone the heartbreaking stories of vaccine-injured people with debilitating neurological symptoms, heart problems, and more is bound to make anyone empathize with those folks. It’s another thing entirely to see the vaccine injured give their testimonies in person.\n\nOne woman approached Brook at an event, and the meeting left an impression on Brook. “She wheeled over in her wheelchair, and I reached down to give her a hug, and she wanted to stand up and hug me,” Brook said. “And she asked me to never stop fighting for vaccine-injured people.”\n\n—\n\nImage credit: RawPixel-Public Health Image Library, CC0 1.0\n\nITO'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/brook-jackson-lawsuit-against-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dismissed/', 'Headline': 'Brook Jackson lawsuit against Pfizer COVID vaccine dismissed', 'Snippet': 'This article the Brook Jackson lawsuit against Pfizer, Ventavia, and Icon regarding the COVID-19 vaccine trials was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical ...', 'Full_text': 'This article the Brook Jackson lawsuit against Pfizer, Ventavia, and Icon regarding the COVID-19 vaccine trials was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination’s social and legal policies.

She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, District Federal Court Judge Michael J. Truncale dismissed the Brook Jackson lawsuit that claimed that Pfizer, Ventavia, and Icon defrauded the United States via COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. The dismissal mostly accepted the claims in the motion to dismiss, claims I have discussed before, but since this is complicated material, it is worth going over it again in the context of this decision.\n\nThis post will explain the lawsuit shortly, then explain the decision, why this is a strong decision that is unlikely to be overturned, and shortly discuss the response from Ms. Jackson and her lawyers.\n\nThe Brook Jackson lawsuit against Pfizer\n\nAs explained in the decision (and the complaint, as I summarized in my previous post), Brook Jackson worked as a regional director for Ventavia Research Group for two weeks in September 2020. At the time, Ventavia was operating three of the clinical trial sites for Pfizer’s large stage III trial of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer’s trial enrolled 46,661 people, half of which got the vaccine and half a saline placebo, and had 160 vaccine testing sites around the world. The three sites operated by Ventavia enrolled around 1,500 people. ICON – the third defendant – was “responsible for ensuring compliance with reporting requirements and clinical trial protocol,” as the decision explained.\n\nFrom the start of her tenure, Ms. Jackson actively warned Ventavia’s people about what she described as violations of regulation in the sites she oversaw. Much of her complaint includes those regulatory violations, and the decision summarizes them in detail on pages 6-11. PP. 11-14 explain Ms. Jackson’s claim that she was fired in retaliation for reporting violations.\n\nAt this stage, the court assumes her claims are true since we are before fact-finding and the question is whether there is enough legal basis to proceed to fact-finding on these claims. So it’s important to remember that at this point, the claims have not been examined by the court. I am not repeating these claims here, because they were not very relevant to the decision, but I certainly acknowledge there may have been violations by Ventavia, and that it was Ms. Jackson’s responsibility to report violations or potential violations, and she did.\n\nAnd for all I know, she may have been fired over those reports, though that is not what Ventavia claimed. Ms. Jackson also reported these alleged violations to the FDA and, at some point, to the Department of Defense. Her claims there certainly deserved investigation – and the FDA may or may not have investigated them thoroughly.\n\nThe FDA did not find them to justify refusing to authorize or approve Pfizer’s vaccine, whether because they did not find the claims correct, because they did not find the violations severe enough, they found the violations were corrected, or because Ventavia only enrolled a small portion of trial participants. I do not know the FDA’s reasoning, but they did not – as Ms. Jackson clearly would have preferred, from her Twitter feed – revoke the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or license that she described as “bogus”.\n\nMs. Jackson, therefore, filed a qui tam lawsuit – a lawsuit as a realtor under the False Claims Act. I have already explained the act in my previous post, so I will simply repost the explanation here:\n\nThe False Claims Act goes back to the 19th century, though its current form is much changed from the original act. At its core, it allows a private individual to bring a lawsuit in the name of the United States government against a false claim – a fraudulent demand for payment – to the government and allows the private party to collect up to 30% of the payment.\n\nMs. Jackson brought claims under two provisions of the False Claims Act, codified in 31 U.S.C. §3729 (1)(A) and (B). These sections allow claims against anyone who –\n\n(A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n\n(B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n\nIn essence, she would have to show that the companies (legal people) she’s suing:\n\n1 – Submitted a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or made a false record “material” to such a claim. Claims can be false factually or legally. False legal claims either expressly say that the submitter complied with regulations or strongly imply it.\n\n2 – That the claim or record was “material” – whether they induced, or contributed to, the payment or approval.\n\n3 – Either that there is a false record supporting the claim, or “falsity, causation, knowledge, and materiality.” The people sued need to “know, deliberately ignore, or recklessly disregard the falsity of their claim.”\n\nIn other words, the False Claims Act is not an “I can make government revoke the license to a vaccine I do not like” claim, or an “I can sue companies that I think did not follow regulations” act, but it’s specifically an act to allow recovery of monetary fraud against the United States.\n\nThat’s the problem Ms. Jackson faced, and the reason her claims were dismissed: essentially, Ms. Jackson’s claim is “regulatory violations make the trial data unreliable, and therefore the vaccine should not have been authorized or approved and Pfizer should not have been paid for it.”\n\nThat’s not what the act is about.\n\nI will add that the judge handling Ms. Jackson’s claim was appointed by President Trump, which would make it harder for anti-vaccine activists to blame political opinions for the decision (though they can, and likely would, try to personally attack him – as Brook Jackson already did).\n\nDecision against the Brook Jackson Pfizer lawsuit\n\nEssentially, Judge Truncale found that whatever the truth about the regulatory violations, Brook Jackson has not shown a false claim for money by the defendants, Pfizer, Ventavia, and Icon, so this is not a good case under the False Claims Act.\n\nHe also found that Ms. Jackson’s suggested amendment to the complaint would not fix the problem, so dismissed it with prejudice – which means Ms. Jackson cannot refile the claim, and all she has left to save this part of her lawsuit is an appeal. The judge did dismiss her retaliation claim “without prejudice,” so her lawyers can amend that part of the complaint and refile – though their chances there would be tricky, too.\n\nJudge Truncale summarized the standard for assessing the law by saying:\n\nIn order to assess liability under § 3729(a)(1)(A) or § 3729(a)(1)(B), the Fifth Circuit asks\n\n(1) whether ‘there was a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct; (2) made or carried out with the requisite scienter; (3) that was material; and (4) that caused the government to pay out money or to forfeit moneys due (i.e., that involved a claim).\n\nIn the first part, Ms. Jackson claimed that Pfizer’s claims to be paid by the Department of Defense were false because they required compliance with FDA regulation and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).\n\nShe alleged that the claims were “legally false” because Pfizer violated the conditions for the payment. The defendants, however, pointed out that the contract in question was a special agreement under the Department of Defense’s “Other Transaction Authority,” and therefore, is not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Ms. Jackson objected to using that source, but the court stated that it will “not veto” DoD’s judgment to use that authority and its judgment that that authority was relevant to “enhancing the mission effectiveness of personnel of the Department of Defense.”\n\nThe contract itself makes no mention of regulations – it simply conditioned payment on delivering an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine, and that was done. Therefore, the payment was not conditioned on compliance with the regulation.\n\nPassing references to FDA requirements that Ms. Jackson mentioned in the oral hearing does not change the reality that the specific payment clauses in the contract only focused on delivering an FDA authorized or approved vaccines, and “specifies ‘[f]or clarity’ that ‘the Government will have no right to withhold payment in respect of any delivered doses unless the FDA has withdrawn approval or authorization of the vaccine.’” This makes it fairly clear that the only condition for payment is an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine.\n\nThe United States also submitted a “Statement of Interest” agreeing with Pfizer on this point. The United States’ statement said:\n\nThe complaint does not identify any provision in the [Contract – referred to as the “Statement of Work, or SOW] for the Project Agreement between Pfizer and the Army that conditioned Government payment for the vaccine on Pfizer’s compliance with the clinical trial protocol or regulations. The SOW, which is attached to the complaint, further sp*ecifies that the Army did not regulate the conduct of the clinical trial, which is “out-of-scope” for the purchase agreement between the Army and Pfizer. In short, the complaint does not plead factual content to support a conclusion that compliance with the clinical trial protocol or regulations was necessary under the contract between Pfizer and the Army such that clinical trial violations would give rise to a claim for express or implied certification liability.”\n\nThis also makes sense policy-wise. Sometimes, regulatory violations justify seeing a product’s license as invalid or revoking it; sometimes they do not. And it makes sense that this decision be made by the authority directly regulating the product – here, FDA – rather than by government agencies that buy the product but may not have the expertise to oversee it.\n\nBrook Jackson also claimed that the Pfizer trial protocol and other documents confirming compliance with regulations show false statements of compliance for payment, but the court pointed out that these documents are not claims for payments – so not basis for Federal Claims Acts violations (again, the act is there to allow recovery of payments made by the government because of false claims, not to punish every regulatory violation).\n\nThe only documents the court was willing to look at for false statements were Pfizer’s invoices, which Brook Jackson did not attach to the complaint, but Pfizer did. The court explains that “…Pfizer’s actual invoices do not contain any certifications about compliance with the clinical trial protocol, FDA regulations, or FAR. [..]. Rather, Pfizer’s invoices certify that “the amounts invoiced are for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement, the work reflected has been performed, and prior payment has not been received.”\n\nAt oral argument, Ms. Jackson claimed that the words “in accordance with the agreement” in the invoice meant Pfizer would meet the FDA’s requirements. The court rejected that, saying:\n\nFirst, reading “in accordance with the agreement” in isolation is misleading. When the phrase in which those words appear—“I certify that the amounts invoiced are for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement”—is read in its entirety, the meaning becomes clear. That is, the price reflected in the invoice—$19.50 per dose—matches the price stated in the Project Agreement. [Dkt. 17-1 at 319; Dkt. 37-2 at 2]. Second, even if “in accordance with the agreement” did refer to some other part of the Project Agreement, the Court has already found that Pfizer’s clinical trial—the activity that Ms. Jackson bases her claims on—was “out of scope” for the Project Agreement between Pfizer and the DoD. Put simply, Pfizer’s invoices do not contain any express false certifications.\n\nThe court also found that there are no specific representations that imply compliance in the invoice, so no implied false statements either.\n\nBrook Jackson also tried to claim that the Pfizer clinical trial protocol and “falsified source documents and data” in it are false records triggering the other section of the False Claims Act. Defendants countered that by claiming that there must be false claims seeking payment from the government – if the contractual payment is justified, there is no claim. This, the court agreed, matched the jurisprudence of the Fifth Circuit.\n\nAlthough Congress amended the False Claim act in between, the amendment did not remove the requirement of a false claim, the court found. Since the contract entitled Pfizer to payment as long as it delivered an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine, and it did, there was no liability here.\n\nAlthough the complaint did not raise it, in her response to the motion to dismiss Ms. Jackson added another claim – that Defendants are liable under a “fraudulent inducement” theory, which essentially means that the invoices were based on previous falsehood used to obtain the emergency authorization, and that previous dishonesty meant the contract was procured by fraud, and therefore, the contract-based-claims are false claims.\n\nThe court dismissed this because it found that Ms. Jackson is not alleging (claiming) that Pfizer procured the vaccine contract through false statements because she is claiming the “lies, omission, and fabrications” to FDA happened after the product.\n\nThis is the only part of the decision that anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch repeated on Twitter. Mr. Kirsch, however, did not bother repeating the judge’s next point, which was that it did not need to decide this issue since Ms. Jackson did not raise it in her complaint, and it cannot do so for the first time – add a new legal theory – in response to a motion to dismiss.\n\nIn addition to not making the case for a false claim, the court found that the misrepresentations alleged – based on contractual violations – was also not material, and to make the case, the misrepresentation “must be material to the Government’s payment decision.”\n\nHere, because the government paid the claim in full while knowing of the alleged violations, they were likely not material.\n\nThe court discusses who needs to know – the FDA which authorized or approved the vaccine, or the DoD which paid for it. The court said that “…well-pleaded facts require drawing the inference that the DoD did not know about the alleged fraud prior to February 22, 2022, approximately two years after it paid Pfizer’s first invoice.”\n\nBut the court finds that the contract between the party left the decision on whether the vaccines were “fit for purchase” to FDA – so the question is whether FDA knew of the alleged violations, and it did, at least since September 2020, when Ms. Jackson complained to them (and the FDA did follow up and talk to her).\n\nDespite that, the FDA has continued to authorize – and even licensed – Pfizer’s vaccine, and has not revoked that. Payments from the government for the vaccine continue. FDA’s review process was, said the court, “public and independent” and “thorough”, and the United States government – unusually – filed a statement supporting the dismissal of Ms. Jackson’s complaint.\n\nThe court goes on to say:\n\nMs. Jackson disagrees with the FDA’s decision to authorize Pfizer’s vaccine. Congress, however, “enacted the FCA to vindicate fraud on the federal government, not second guess decisions made by those empowered through the democratic process to shape public policy.” Harman, 872 F.3d at 668–69. “When the government, at appropriate levels, repeatedly concludes that it has not been defrauded, it is not forgiving a found fraud—rather it is concluding that there was no fraud at all.”\n\nThe court also adds, in another section, that there is no real allegation that the alleged violations led to “the FDA receiving fabricated, inaccurate, or misleading data about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine” – the complaint does not connect the alleged violations to problems. Further, since the authorization is based on the total available data, Ventavia only enrolled 3% of participants and the claim touches on a fraction of that, there is nothing there to show that the criteria for emergency use authorization were not met.\n\nMs. Jackson’s retaliation claim was also dismissed because she did not allege that she was trying to show illegality or fraud as the Federal False Claim Act states – essentially, she was not, as explained above, alleging false claims for payment. But the court did give her the ability to amend that part of her complaint, and her lawyer stated that they would refile it.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nResponding to the dismissal, Ms. Jackson expressed understandable disappointment, and both she and her lawyer announced an intent to appeal the decision. Ms. Jackson also said they are “working to convene a grand jury”, whatever that means.\n\nHer appeal would usually have little chance because the judge made it very clear that she did not provide a basis for liability under the False Claims Act. Although some of the recent decisions from the Fifth Circuit have been in tension with existing law, I see no reason to let them off the hook on this; they should stick to the law and uphold the dismissal, and if they fail to do that, they should be criticized and overturned by the Supreme Court.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2628', 'Headline': 'FDA oversight of clinical trials is “grossly inadequate ... - The BMJ', 'Snippet': 'Covid-19 vaccines and drugs were developed at “warp speed” and now experts are concerned that the US Food and Drug Administration inspected too few clinical trial sites.

What I was reporting was so important,” Jackson told The BMJ. The FDA did not, however, inspect the trial sites in question.\n\nThis lack of oversight was not an isolated case, The BMJ has learnt.

The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/8-countries-that-reported-zero-covid-cases-as-per-who/photostory/89725668.cms', 'Headline': '8 countries that reported zero COVID cases as per WHO', 'Snippet': 'If this has you intrigued, checkout this list of countries with zero COVID cases. ...

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/china/china-zero-covid-impact-beijing-intl-hnk-mic/index.html', 'Headline': 'China scraps virus tracking app as country braces for Covid impact', 'Snippet': 'The country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nChina is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.\n\nChanges continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.\n\nThe system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.\n\nIt had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.\n\nBut as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.\n\nThroughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2', 'Headline': 'The WHO estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 ...', 'Snippet': 'a, Cumulative global excess death estimates and the cumulative reported COVID-19 deaths by month from January 2020 to December 2021.b, Global excess death rates per 100,000 population and the ...', 'Full_text': 'Detailed descriptions of the process followed, data used and methods applied to generate the estimates of excess mortality within this paper are provided in the Methods and summarized here. The WHO, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, assembled a technical advisory group to develop guidance on how to best estimate excess mortality in light of extensive data gaps. Preliminary estimates were generated according to the advice of this group and, following standard WHO procedures, a consultative process was initiated with member states who assessed the input data sources, methods and results, and provided feedback which was in turn used to update the estimates. Ideally, we would have ACM data for all countries and for all months. The reality is that such monthly national data are available for only 100 countries (52%), with other countries having annual data, subnational data or no data. For the latter three cases, we predict the monthly data within a Poisson count model framework, as detailed in the Methods.\n\nThe ACM data used for our modelling come from various sources including nominated country focal points and public-facing databases, and can be characterized according to three criteria: whether the data are nationally representative, what proportion of the two-year pandemic period they cover and the time periods to which the data are aggregated.\n\nBy region, the monthly data that are available consist of only 6 out of the 47 countries in the Africa region (13%), 23 out of the 35 countries from the region of the Americas (66%), 9 out of the 21 countries from the Eastern Mediterranean region (43%), 51 out of the 53 countries in the European region (96%), 2 out of 11 countries in the South East Asia region (18%) and 9 out of 27 countries in the Western Pacific region (33%). There are 10 countries with subnational or annual data; 4 are from the region of the Americas, 1 from the European region, 3 from the South East Asia region and 2 from the Western Pacific region.\n\nWe use a Bayesian Poisson framework to estimate both the expected deaths (for all countries and all months) in the absence of the pandemic, and the ACM for those countries with no such data during the pandemic. In addition to the data on ACM, we gathered information on specific variables with spatiotemporal variations considered to be associated with changes in excess mortality over the course of the pandemic. These variables are chosen based on the strengths of the associations and availability across locations for the duration under study. We consider several that are assumed to change by month such as the COVID-19 death rate, the COVID-19 test positivity rate, aggregate containment measures (combining lockdown restrictions and closures) and average national temperature, together with others that are fixed over the period of study including a high-income country binary indicator, historic cardiovascular disease death rates and historic diabetes prevalence rates. A log-linear regression model on these variables, also within the Bayesian Poisson framework, is used to predict mortality levels in the locations without adequate reporting of mortality during the pandemic. For a handful of countries, instead of covariates, their subnational observed deaths are used to predict the national deaths using multinomial models that assume the relationships estimated between pre-pandemic subnational and national mortality persist into the pandemic. Finally, the reported or distributions of predicted deaths, conditional on data availability, together with the derived expected death distributions, are used to estimate monthly excess deaths in all locations for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nThere are many different facets to the monthly time series of excess mortality that we may examine: (1) the raw excess counts, (2) the excess rate (say per 100,000 of population), (3) the P-score, which is the ratio of the excess to the expected and (4) the ratio of the excess to the reported COVID-19 deaths. Each of the four metrics are not known with certainty, even when we observe the total ACM over the complete pandemic, because the expected numbers are estimated. In general, between-region and between-country comparisons are difficult for many reasons, including the different age structures of the populations.\n\nRaw excess counts directly show the basic human toll of the pandemic but are obviously critically dependent on the population size of the group (for example, country, region) over which we are calculating the excess. The excess rate adjusts for the population, to produce summaries that are more comparable across countries. It would be preferable to adjust for the age–sex population structure of each country, but unfortunately we do not have reliable excess counts by age and sex for all countries of the world.\n\nAnother method to compare countries’ excess deaths is to normalize the excess estimates by the expected number of deaths for the analysed period, expressed as a percentage. This measure is know as a P-score12. For example, if 100 deaths were expected to occur and the actual number of deaths was 140, excess deaths would be 40 and the P-score would be 40%. The P-score implicitly considers both the population size and the age structure. Two countries may have identical population sizes, but very different routine mortality because of the age structure. For example, both Iran and Germany have a similar population size of about 83 million in 2019 but annual mortality that year was almost 2.5 times higher in Germany13, mainly due to the German population being much older. For example, in Germany, 16% of the population are over the age of 65 whereas in Iran it is less than 4% (ref. 14). Hence, the expected deaths are higher in Germany than in Iran. Continuing with this example, an excess deaths estimate of (say) 100,000 in both countries would rank them identically on a per capita basis, but the P-score in Iran would be higher than Germany’s owing to it being a higher relative increase compared to the expected number of deaths.\n\nGlobal, regional and income group summary\n\nGlobally, for the period January 2020 to December 2021, we estimate 14.83 million excess deaths with an uncertainty interval (UI) of 13.23 million to 16.58 million, which is 2.74 (UI 2.44 to 3.06) times higher than the 5.42 million COVID-19 deaths reported to the WHO for this period. Throughout the paper, the reported UIs are 95% Bayesian credible intervals. We estimate 4.47 (UI 3.91 to 5.07) excess deaths in 2020 and 10.36 (UI 9.06 to 11.97) in 2021 globally. Turning to the P-scores, there were 7.97% (UI 6.96% to 9.03%) and 18.30% (UI 15.99% to 21.15%) increases in deaths globally in 2020 and 2021, respectively, compared to what we would have expected if the pandemic had not occurred.\n\nThe top panel of Fig. 1 shows the cumulative excess and reported COVID-19 deaths by month. We see the steepening of the curve in the middle of 2021. This sharp increase is almost entirely due to the estimate of the catastrophic wave that hit India at this time. In the bottom panel, the monthly excess death rate per 100,000 is plotted, and again, the peak towards the middle of 2021 is evident.\n\nIn the Extended Data Table 1 we provide summaries aggregated across all 194 WHO member states to give global estimates for the period January 2020 to December 2021. We also aggregate the member state estimates according to the six WHO regions and for the same period. The greatest contribution to the total is estimated for the SEAR region. The ratio of excess mortality to reported COVID-19 mortality is greatest in the AFR and SEAR regions, although we must emphasize that these are the regions with the greatest data paucity. As measured by the P-score, the worst affected regions were AMR (22%) and SEAR (22%), with EUR (17%) and EMR (12%) having intermediate values and AFR (8%) and WPR (0%) having the lowest values.\n\nIn the Extended Data Table 2 we also provide the corresponding summaries when the member state estimates are aggregated according to the four World Bank income groupings. There are wide variations across the respective economies but in general the estimates point to excess mortality being magnitudes higher than the reported COVID-19 mortality. Over 50% of the estimated excess occurs in lower-middle income economies. The low-income economies include much of sub-Saharan Africa, which reported relatively few COVID-19 deaths.\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot P-scores by month globally and for each WHO region. The global P-score increases steadily to the end of 2020, and then drops before a sharp increase in the middle of 2021, followed by a steady decline. The striking peak is in SEAR for the middle of 2021 for which we estimate that more than twice as many deaths have occurred, relative to those expected for this period. AMR has a peak in January 2021, and EUR has a peak at the end of 2020, and then drops before steadily increasing in 2021.\n\nSelected country summary\n\nFigure 3 displays the excess deaths estimates and reported COVID-19 death counts for the 25 countries with the highest numbers of estimated excess deaths, along with error bars for the uncertainty interval. The 20 countries with the highest excess estimates represent approximately half (48.9%) the global population and account for over 80% of the estimated global excess deaths for the January 2020 to December 2021 period. These countries are (in alphabetical order) Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Ukraine and the United States of America.\n\nThere are an estimated 4.74 million (UI 3.31 to 6.45 million) excess deaths for India alone in the period January 2020 to December 2021, followed by 1.07 million (UI 1.05 to 1.10 million) excess deaths in the Russian Federation, 1.03 million (UI 0.75 to 1.29 million) excess deaths in Indonesia and 932K (UI 887K to 978K) excess deaths in the United States of America. Figure 3 contains countries of all possible data types in our model:\n\nCountries with full ACM data for the entire analysed period (Russian Federation, United States of America, Brazil, Egypt, Spain and so on) for which the uncertainty in the estimates comes from the expected (counterfactual) number of deaths and is therefore relatively narrow.\n\nCountries with mixed ACM data (India, Indonesia, Turkey), that is, subnational data projected to the national level. This produces an additional layer of uncertainty from the projection of the information to the national level.\n\nCountries for which ACM data were unavailable (Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and so on), where the estimates are derived from the covariate prediction model. In these countries the uncertainty is the highest and results are to be interpreted with the greatest caution. However, the estimated undercount in these countries is well within the plausible range of undercounts as estimated for countries with full ACM data.\n\nThe total estimated excess deaths are heavily determined by the population size of each country. Figure 4 shows a map of the estimated P-scores for 2020–2021, and Fig. 5 displays the 25 countries with the highest estimated P-scores. In both figures the P-scores are calculated using expected numbers over 2020–2021.\n\nFrom the P-score point of view, the worst impacted countries generally have smaller populations than those from Fig. 3. For example, India and the United States of America have the highest and fourth highest estimated excess deaths in the world in absolute terms but the United States of America is absent from the top 25 and India is 21st in the list. On the other hand, smaller countries such as Peru, Bulgaria and Bolivia have been impacted more heavily, relative to population size, when examining excess mortality in absolute terms.\n\nSo far as individual countries are concerned, Peru has a devastating P-score estimate of 97%, a doubling of deaths over the pandemic relative to what was expected. Other countries with a large increase include Ecuador with a 51% increase in deaths and Bolivia with a 49% increase.\n\nFigure 6 maps the ratio of excess deaths to reported COVID-19 deaths. There is a wide range for this excess measure, with many countries in the AFRO region having high ratios, and countries in Western Europe having ratios closer to 1 (with some, such as France, having values below 1). Globally, over January 2020–December 2021, there were 5,420,534 reported COVID-19 deaths, and according to our estimates, the ratio of excess to reported COVID-19 deaths is 2.74 (UI 2.44 to 3.06), which is a huge discrepancy.\n\nAs mentioned previously, we estimate the highest cumulative excess death numbers for India, accounting for 4.74 million deaths with a 95% credible interval of (3.31, 6.45) million. We base this estimate for India on subnational data—we have mortality data for 17 states and union territories (out of 36) over the pandemic. Using a proportionality assumption as discussed in the Methods and in Knutson et al.15, we produce a national estimate. In the Supplementary information we summarize excess estimates from other studies that use different data sources and illustrate that our estimates are consistent with these estimates.\n\nA crucial component of the excess calculation is the estimation of the expected number of deaths. There are two elements to the calculation, the mortality data upon which it is based and the model that is adopted. First, with respect to the data, the WHO adjust the raw mortality counts, if there is perceived to be any incompleteness in reporting (and the scaling value may be carried forward to the pandemic period). We note that as part of the process to produce excess estimates, country consultation is carried out, in which the adjusted country numbers are shared with nationally nominated focal points who are tasked with reviewing the adjusted counts. Second, for the expected counts modelling, we used splines both for the annual trend and for the within-year seasonal variation. A country for which the completeness adjustment and spline modelling provided a less than satisfactory excess estimate was Germany. Under the default data process/spline modelling the excess estimate was 195,000 with 95% credible interval (161,000, 229,000). However, on closer examination this excess estimate was too high because of a combination of data/model issues. For Germany, ACM in 2016–2018 were scaled up owing to the completeness assessment, which lead to a dip in the ACM sequence in 2019. The annual spline fit to these adjusted data produced expected numbers that were too low (and therefore an excess that was too high). Hence, we reanalysed the Germany data with unadjusted data and a linear term, rather than a spline. This produced a more realistic excess estimate of 122,000 with a 95% credible interval of (101,000, 143,000).\n\nFor Sweden, we were concerned there were similar issues because of an unnecessary completeness adjustment of the raw mortality figure reported to the WHO in 2019 (the mortality count was lower than recent counts). The original excess estimate was 11,300 (9,900, 12,700). On closer scrutiny, we decided that this adjustment was not necessary and we redid the analysis for Sweden, again including a linear term for the annual trend instead of a spline (for the same reasons as described for Germany). This operation resulted in an estimate for Sweden that was higher, specifically 13,400 (11,700, 15,200). The changes in the excess estimates for Germany and Sweden do not change the global or EURO figures substantively (and the figures quoted in this paper are based on the revised estimates). As a side note, for both these countries when using the unadjusted data, both the linear and spline annual trend models produced similar excess estimates. However, using a spline for the annual trend can lead to sensitivity to the last year of pre-pandemic data, and a priority going forward is to systematically compare and evaluate different models for producing the expected numbers, building on recent work16. For the next round of estimates we will also revisit the under-reporting adjustment procedure. More details on revisiting the Germany and Sweden estimates are in the Supplementary information.\n\nA natural inclination is to rank countries in terms of one of the metrics we have discussed. Basing rankings on point estimates will often be misleading because, particularly in the context of estimating excess mortality, there will often be considerable uncertainty in the chosen metric for a given country.\n\nIn the Methods, we include an illustrative example of a rankings analysis, using the excess rate. We show how one can evaluate the (posterior) probability that the excess is greater in one country than in another and provide graphical summaries to aid in interpretation. We also discuss the temporal comparison of rankings. In the Supplementary information, we describe a more substantive analysis that addresses how the United Kingdom compared to countries of the European Union, in terms of the excess rate and the P-score, over the pandemic.\n\nIn general, one can rarely simply look at the excess rate and associated rankings and make statements concerning the manner in which a country dealt with the pandemic, as there are many factors at play. These include: the age structure of the population, the population density and cultural practices, the government responses during different periods of the epidemic, how the population responded to government actions, and the infectiousness and fatality rates of the various variants that were present at different times.\n\nThese estimates call our attention to four important points. First and foremost, COVID-19 has resulted in marked global excess mortality: 14.83 million deaths (13.23, 16.58) over 2020–2021. In 2020, the excess was 4.47 (3.91, 5.07) million and in 2021, the excess was 10.36 (9.06, 11.97) million. The majority of the countries in the world have seen substantive increases in mortality.\n\nSecond, both the reported and excess estimated toll of COVID-19 were heavier in 2021 than in 2020. Third, excess mortality is much higher than reported COVID-19 mortality globally. In many countries COVID-19 deaths have been reported accurately, yet in others, the estimated excess mortality is much higher than reported COVID-19 mortality, occasionally by several orders of magnitude. In total, the estimates show that global excess mortality is 2.74 times higher than reported COVID-19 deaths. Finally, for almost half the countries of the world, tracking excess mortality is not possible using the data that are available and for these we must rely on statistical models. Critically, the missing countries are not randomly spread across the globe and so the countries with missing data may be systematically different from the sample of countries for which we do have data when we account for the age distributions of the populations, the underlying disease burdens of the countries, what is known about the strengths of their health systems and potentially most importantly, when, and how the pandemic evolved within their borders. These differences considered, some of the estimates and uncertainty intervals for locations for which we know very little must be interpreted with caution.\n\nDespite its strengths, this study has important limitations extending beyond the data paucity mentioned above. The non-COVID counterfactual trend is derived using historical data and is sensitive to the assumptions made in the forecast. The weight given to recent data years relative to those further back in time, and how smoothly changes over time are projected to persist into the pandemic period, can influence the expected levels. We used spline models as the basis for the modelling of the expected numbers, but as we have mentioned will revisit this choice for the next round of estimates, as such models can produce inappropriate extrapolations. Another limitation relates to the quality of the input data used. The completeness of observed deaths and the consistency in quality as well as construct validity for the various covariates used in the regression model, impact the accuracy of the empirical estimates of excess and the robustness of the predictive model for deriving excess for countries in which deaths have not been observed16. Currently, completeness of reporting during the pandemic is based on historic completeness of registered deaths relative to the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE)17. The GHE uses multiple data sources to generate country-, age-, sex-, year- and cause-specific mortality estimates, which in turn undergo extensive country consultation. However, comparing 2019 estimates of the GHE to registered deaths from even high-quality registration systems, some differences are observed. Subsequent iterations of the excess mortality work will include updates to how the expected deaths are derived and how completeness of reporting is calculated and extrapolated to the pandemic period.\n\nThe greater proportion of global excess is derived using observed mortality data and the estimated toll is staggeringly high. To place these estimates in context, the leading cause of death in 2019 was ischaemic heart disease, with 8.9 million deaths (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death). Information on the leading causes of death is not currently available for the pandemic years, but we would expect COVID-19 to be among the leading causes of death in 2020 and the leading cause of death in 2021. We estimate that the mean global per capita excess mortality rate was 0.06% in 2020, more than doubling to 0.13% in 2021. This surpasses the influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009 (estimated at 0.04%, 0.03% and 0.005%, respectively)18. However, the 1918 influenza pandemic was magnitudes higher, with an estimated 1.0% per capita excess mortality rate, or 75 million global excess deaths when adjusted to the 2020 population18.\n\nExcess mortality quantifies the increase in mortality from all causes, including direct COVID-19 deaths, indirect COVID-19 deaths (for example, health-system overload) and strictly non-COVID-19 deaths (for example, those resulting from other health shocks such as violent conflict or disasters). These estimates from the WHO cannot quantify the relative importance of each of these factors. However, considering the low levels of excess mortality in countries in which COVID-19 transmission, infection and mortality rates were low during some of the analysed period (for example, Malaysia, Mongolia, Uruguay in 2020) or its entirety (for example, Australia, Japan, New Zealand), suggests that in many countries the greater proportion of excess deaths can be attributed to COVID-19 directly. In fact, where accurately quantified, excess mortality may provide a reliable lower-bound on COVID-19 deaths considering that for several countries, we have mortality deficits or negative estimates for certain months. The greater number of these countries have high-quality reporting systems and this deficit is due to deaths from non-natural and natural causes decreasing during the analysed period13 and there having been less severe influenza seasons in 2020 and 2021 relative to previous years19. In many such countries, mortality improvements may be attributable to health systems being especially geared up to respond, the populations seeking early attention because of heightened sensitivity to health issues, compliance with public health and social measures that could reduce transmission of other infections and containment measures such as lockdowns. However, we are also aware that there have been non-COVID-19-related crises that have been experienced by some countries, for example, the conflict in Armenia, for which only a proportion of the excess mortality in 2020 would rightly be associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe alternative to excess mortality estimates—that is, relying on reported COVID-19 deaths—represents a severe undercount of the toll. Indeed, even in countries with ACM data for which the estimates are much more certain, mortality has risen substantially such that excess mortality is much higher than reported COVID-19 deaths, whether it is by 50% or by several hundred per cent. There is very little chance that the countries for which ACM data are not available have been able to report COVID-19 deaths accurately. There is ample, albeit preliminary evidence from many countries for which ACM data were not obtained (such as Pakistan and Haiti), that mortality has increased, and excess mortality is much higher than reported COVID-19 deaths. As another example, in the Africa region for which ACM data are most lacking, recent studies have highlighted the underestimation in the reported statistics20. In this region, the direct estimates of the ratio between excess mortality and reported COVID-19 deaths spans the gamut from about 1 in Tunisia to 2.62 in South Africa, 12 in Egypt and over 20 in Algeria. Thus, although a total regional estimate of a ratio of 8.03 might seem high at first glance, it is well within bounds of the more certain ratios and the true, yet unknown ratio, may very well be even higher both regionally and globally. As already noted, the excess estimates for sub-Saharan Africa are the least robust because of a paucity of data.\n\nIn the two years within which the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted humanity, important lessons remain to be fully documented and harnessed as part of the global public health surveillance capacity. First, the urgent need to improve data and health information systems and the way data are collected, analysed, shared and reported. Second, the required alignments of communicable disease surveillance with the continuous strengthening of health information systems and their integration with other existing routine surveillance systems, and with demographic and geographic monitoring systems to facilitate timely and targeted interventions. COVID-19 surveillance must also be combined with Universal Health Coverage and the International Health Regulations monitoring and related indicators for health-system preparedness, including vaccine coverage and water, sanitation and hygiene services.\n\nAs shown in the Supplementary information, there is a more than doubling of excess deaths when comparing 2021 to 2020. Despite the advances in diagnostics and therapeutics in 2020 and the rapid development of vaccines throughout the year, the end of 2020 saw the permeation of the virus into highly populous societies that had previously suffered limited exposure. In 2021, the rise in infections outpaced the roll-out of vaccines in many such locations and this either led to or was worsened by the emergence of more infectious, higher fatality, SARS-CoV-2 strains such as the Delta variant. We can speculate about how vaccine hesitancy, premature relaxation of containment measures and a global COVID-19 ‘fatigue’ contributed to how the pandemic developed but this is an important area for further study. And although the variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge (https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants) and are sequenced to identify variants that are likely to produce more serious illness, there remains limited information in real time to track them to create early warning systems of global import. This is critical as even the impact of less severe variants such as Omicron cannot be discounted among unvaccinated and older adult populations21.\n\nTo emerge from this crisis, the world needs to be able to monitor mortality and morbidity with real-time, reliable and actionable data. Strengthened country capacity for data and information requires collaboration across governmental and non-governmental institutions, including ministries of health and finance, hospitals, insurance companies, charities, national statistics institutions, offices of the registrar general, local and regional government, think tanks, academia and more. Monitoring systems of specific causes and ACM at the national, regional and global levels may serve as an early warning system for future health emergencies that will allow more timely responses to prevent local outbreaks from inflicting harms on lives and livelihoods in their immediate surroundings and across the world. Gaps in knowledge and data lead to gaps in response. It is thus vital for future responses that countries have well-functioning CRVS systems, which are the foundation upon which monitoring, prevention and future advancements on health rest.\n\nWHO has made all of the results of the excess mortality estimates publicly available in an interactive web application at https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/covid19excess/. This tool allows transparent exploration of estimates from the country level up to the regional and global levels. All data and code are available at https://github.com/WHOexcessc19/Codebase, so that our analyses and the results are completely reproducible.\n\nThe WHO excess mortality model is a live model that will be periodically updated given additional mortality data as well as data on covariates of relevance. We will also continue to improve the statistical framework and model. These estimates also serve as inputs to other important projects such as WHO’s GHE17 and the UN’s World Population Prospects14. Although WHO has made preliminary results available disaggregated by broad age groups and by sex for every country, region and the world and documented the method to do this22, this is work in progress and hence will be reported in a future paper.\n\nProcess\n\nThe process for producing the estimates of excess mortality consisted of three main steps. First, a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was established to develop a set of methods that were used to produce estimates of excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in countries. Second, WHO member states were consulted on the estimates, input data sources and methods. Finally, feedback from the countries was then incorporated into the modelling to update the estimates. The details of each step are described below.\n\nIn February 2021, the WHO, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, formed the TAG on COVID-19 Mortality Assessment to advise on the development of analytical methods for estimating excess mortality in all countries. The TAG is composed of leading demographers, epidemiologists, economists, data and social scientists and statisticians from a range of backgrounds and geographies. A complete list of the TAG members is provided at the end of the paper. In addition to determining the levels and the age and sex distributions of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the expertise of the TAG has been leveraged to study the impact of the pandemic on broader areas such as inequality in COVID-19 mortality between and within countries, death registration and reporting systems, and how existing surveys and censuses can be used to fill in data gaps to quantify the impact of the pandemic. At the time of writing, this work is still ongoing.\n\nIn August 2021, a circular letter was sent to all WHO member states to nominate focal points to take part in country consultation. Member states were requested to review and provide feedback on the preliminary estimates of COVID-19 excess mortality and submit additional data that may not have been previously available to WHO. The first round of the country consultation was conducted between October and November 2021 through WHO’s Country Portal, an online platform to facilitate data exchange between member states and WHO, for which the draft estimates and methodology for each country were made available to the designated national focal points. Countries that had not nominated a focal point were approached through their respective WHO country office or permanent mission in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nBetween October 2021 and February 2022, a global technical consultation and two information sessions with member states were held to brief them on the progress and exchange views on the methodology. A series of regional webinars and technical consultations with individual countries were also organized for further discussion on input data, methods and estimates. By the end of March 2022, 140 countries (or 72% of the 194 member states) had participated in the country consultation, 65 had provided some data and 76 had provided feedback, which was then used to generate updated estimates. The revised estimates for a 24-month period from January 2020 to December 2021 were shared with the national focal points in March 2022.\n\nThe process of generating the estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has followed the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting23. In view of the fast-changing situation surrounding the pandemic, the excess mortality estimates will continue to be refined and revised as more data are identified and the methodology evolves over time.\n\nData\n\nThe specific countries from each region for which data have been gathered are listed in the Supplementary information and are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. Estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic require historical ACM data that can be used to generate the death numbers under a hypothetical non-COVID-19 scenario, as well as ACM data for the target years against which the counterfactual is contrasted to calculate the excess. In the absence of nationally representative data, subnational data can be used to estimate national totals.\n\nReported ACM data at the national level on a weekly or monthly basis are available for only a subset of countries. The data used in this study span multiple sources:\n\nData routinely shared with WHO as part of its standing agreement with member states as well as specifically provided to WHO in response to a data call for this project.\n\nData that have been reported by European countries to Eurostat according to the European Statistical System24.\n\nData that have been compiled for the Human Mortality Database as part of the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project25,26.\n\nData that have been compiled in the World Mortality dataset13.\n\nAdditionally, annual level data for 2020 and/or 2021 were obtained from the national statistics offices of China27,28, Grenada29, Saint Kitts and Nevis30, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines31, Sri Lanka32 and Vietnam33.\n\nThe countries with current reported ACM generally have ACM data for the pre-pandemic period as well. For those without such historical data, the WHO GHE34 database was used. Using the annual historic mortality we forecasted expected ACM to 2020 and 2021, to provide the expected mortality in these locations. The method for this forecast will be described shortly.\n\nIn addition to the data on reported ACM and the estimates from the GHE, the final dimension to the input data are variables that can potentially be used as predictors for excess mortality in those countries/time periods without ACM data. The strategy applied to create a covariate list was pragmatic and focused on identifying those variables that have been found to be contextually important and that have been measured/estimated in the majority of countries. The predictor variables are composed of both time-varying and time-invariant variables. Time-varying variables were the test positivity rate, temperature, confirmed COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 population (which is reported to the WHO), COVID-19 positive test rate per 100,000 population (from Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org) and a variable constructed from a number of containment measures35. The COVID-19 death rate and the positive test rate are available for all member states for the entire period (https://covid19.who.int/). The time-invariant variables were a binary measure of the income level (low/middle versus high) and the historic diabetes prevalence and cardiovascular mortality rates as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease project9.\n\nSubnational-level (states, provinces, cities, collections thereof and so on) data were obtained from various sources for Argentina36, India37,38,39,40,41,42, Indonesia43 and Turkey44.\n\nStatistical models\n\nWe write the excess in country \\(c\\) at time \\(t\\) as\n\n$${\\delta }_{c,t}={Y}_{c,t}-{E}_{c,t},$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\({Y}_{c,t}\\) is the realized ACM and \\({E}_{c,t}\\) is the ACM that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. Even for countries with fully observed ACM during the pandemic the excess is a random quantity, because we do not know the counts \\({E}_{c,t}\\) that would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic—the latter is the result of a modelling exercise, which produces forecasted ACM, with associated uncertainty.\n\nThe major challenges for modelling are to form a coherent approach in the face of disparate data sources of varying degrees of quality and in different spatially and temporally aggregated forms. We constructed a model from first principles within a Bayesian inferential framework, and as a first step developed a framework in which we directly model the raw death counts (as opposed to derived quantities such as rates). Death is binary, and so must follow a Bernoulli distribution, and it is also statistically rare, and so the Bernoulli can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution. The advantage of the latter is that it is amenable to manipulation when one considers subsets of availability such as over space (when subnational data only are available) or over time (when annual counts only are available). In the Poisson model the variance equals the mean, which is restrictive as mortality data typically exhibit greater variability than the nominal variance. Hence, we use models that allow for such excess-Poisson variation.\n\nFor modelling all countries of the world we need to consider various data situations. Although some countries have full data, others have annual or subnational data only, and for countries with no data we need to build a predictive model based on country-specific variables. Extended Data Figure 2 shows the relationship between the different models, and how they feed into the excess calculation.\n\nModel for expected numbers\n\nFor all countries and time points we model the expected numbers on the basis of historic data (for most countries, the period 2015–2019 was used for this modelling). We use a negative binomial model that allows for excess-Poisson variation. The annual historic yearly trend in ACM is modelled using a spline model, and within-year variation using a seasonal spline model. A spline is a flexible approach to modelling that allows departures from a linear association45. A negative binomial model has two parameters, a mean (which is obtained from spline components), and a scale parameter that accounts for excess-Poisson variation. The mean count for country \\(c\\) and in month \\(t\\) is modelled as:\n\n$${{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}}_{c,t}=\\exp ({{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{d}}}_{c}+{{\\rm{s}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{s}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{p}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}}_{c,t})$$\n\nwhere the annual trend uses a thin-plate spline and the seasonal component uses a cyclic cubic spline. After fitting to pre-pandemic data, we project the modelled trend forward to predict expected counts, by month, for 2020 and 2021. There is uncertainty in these predictions, which we incorporate into the excess mortality uncertainty intervals we produce.\n\nFor some countries, we only have national historic ACM data. For such countries we model within-year variation using temperature as a surrogate for seasonality. Full details of all modelling steps are given in Knutson et al.15.\n\nModel for countries without full pandemic data\n\nFor almost half of the 194 WHO member states we do not have the ACM counts over the pandemic, and so must predict them using country characteristics. We choose a simple form for this prediction model, with mean\n\n$$\\text{E}\\left[{Y}_{{ct}}{\\rm{|}}{E}_{c,t}\\right]={E}_{c,t}{\\theta }_{c,t},$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\({\\theta }_{c,t} > 0\\) is a relative rate parameter. If \\({\\theta }_{c,t} > 1\\), then for country \\(c\\) and at month \\(t\\) the mortality is greater than expected, whereas if \\({\\theta }_{c,t} < 1\\), then for country \\(c\\) and at month \\(t\\) the mortality is less than expected. We used \\(G\\) time-invariant variables, \\({Z}_{{gc}}\\) (these are annual values from 2019). These were an indicator of high income and/or low or middle income, the cardiovascular mortality rate in 2019 and the diabetes prevalence rate in 2019. In addition, we used \\(B\\) time-varying variables: a containment variable (it is calculated using all ordinal containment and closure policy indicators and health-system policy indicators, for further details see Hale et al.14), the square root of the reported COVID-19 death rate, temperature and the COVID-19 test positivity rate. We then build a log-linear model for the rate parameter:\n\n$$\\log {\\theta }_{c,t}=\\mathop{\\underbrace{\\alpha }}\\limits_{{\\rm{I}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{p}}{\\rm{t}}}+\\mathop{\\underbrace{\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{g=1}^{G}{\\gamma }_{g}\\,{Z}_{gc}}}\\limits_{{\\rm{T}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{e}}-{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{v}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}\\,{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{s}}}+\\mathop{\\underbrace{\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{b=1}^{B}{\\beta }_{bt}{X}_{bct}}}\\limits_{{\\rm{T}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{e}}-{\\rm{v}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{y}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{g}}\\,{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{s}}}+\\mathop{\\underbrace{{{\\epsilon }}_{c,t}\\,}}\\limits_{{\\rm{E}}{\\rm{x}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{s}}{\\rm{s}}-{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{s}}{\\rm{s}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}\\,{\\rm{v}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{n}}}$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \\({\\rm{\\exp }}\\left({\\gamma }_{g}\\right)\\) and \\({\\rm{\\exp }}\\left({\\beta }_{{bt}}\\right)\\) denote relative rate parameters and \\({{\\epsilon }}_{c,t}\\sim {\\rm{N}}(0,{{\\sigma }}_{{\\epsilon }}^{2})\\) are independent error contributions that pick up random variation unexplained by the log-linear regression function. The time-varying coefficients allow the associations to evolve during the pandemic. As we desire the evolution to be smooth in time, for these time-varying coefficients \\({\\beta }_{c,t}\\) we use a random walk of order 2 (RW2) prior that encourages smooth estimates46. In equation (2) above, we have conditioned on known expected numbers. In reality, and as just described, these are modelled to give a distribution over plausible values. The uncertainty in the expected predictions \\({E}_{c,t}\\) is well modelled by a gamma distribution, and the advantage of this choice is that it can be conveniently combined with a Poisson model to produce a negative binomial model with the log-linear mean given by equation (3). Full details (including evidence of the accuracy of the gamma model) can be found in Knutson et al.15.\n\nThis model was fitted to all countries with observed monthly ACM data over some portion of 2020–2021, using the integrated nested Laplace approximation method47, to obtain posterior distributions over the unknown parameters. The resultant posterior distribution reflects the uncertainty in the parameters (both in the expected numbers and the log-linear covariate model), and can be used to construct a predictive distribution for the ACM in countries with no data or partial data.\n\nFor some countries, only subnational data were available, and so we construct a model for the national ACM data using a proportionality assumption, expanding on previous work48. We describe the model in the context of India. We use ACM data from 17 states and union territories out of 36 (data from different numbers of states are available in different pandemic months) to infer the national total, under the assumption that the proportion of deaths in the states with available data remains approximately constant over time. For example, if a state historically accounts for 10% of deaths in India, one would predict a national death total of 10\\(\\times \\) the observed number of deaths in that state only. Under the Poisson framework, this proportionality assumption yields a multinomial distribution for the fractions of deaths and we can predict the unknown national totals over the course of the pandemic after fitting the multinomial model.\n\nExtensive model validation was carried out for both the countries with no data, and those with subnational data only. This included exercises in which we systematically removed all data for each country in turn, or we removed data for all countries for single months. We then predicted these removed data using the retained data and evaluated model performance using metrics such as bias and the coverage of prediction intervals. Results for these exercises can be found in the supplementary materials of Knutson et al.15. We emphasize that the model (3) is not used for countries with subnational data.\n\nFor other countries that have annual (but not monthly) national data during the pandemic, we lean on the fact that the distribution of Poisson monthly counts, given the annual count, is multinomial with probabilities that are the normalized rate parameters, that is,\n\n$${p}_{c,t}=\\frac{{E}_{c,t}{\\theta }_{c,t}}{\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{{t}^{{\\prime} }=1}^{12}{E}_{c,{t}^{{\\prime} }}{\\theta }_{c,{t}^{{\\prime} }}}.$$\n\nwhere the rates \\({\\theta }_{c,t}\\) are defined via the log-linear covariate model (3). This gives us a way to apportion the annual counts to the constituent months.\n\nOur approach, differs from those of the other two global endeavours of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)49 and The Economist50. We have used a very conventional statistical modelling approach in which a parametric model is fitted using Bayesian inferential machinery, and with the models for different data types being consistent with each other to make the country by country results directly comparable to each other. As an example, if the mortality in subnational regions are Poisson random variables, then the sum (the mortality in the country) is also Poisson. Further, given the total mortality in a country the subnational counts follow a multinomial distribution. Our framework exploits these relationships when we formulate models for the situation in which we have subnational data only. Similarly, our annual model (for countries with such data only) is consistent with the monthly models we use for the majority of the countries. The IHME approach is unprincipled and not transparent and corresponds to a number of steps being bolted together, without a coherent model tying them together. Rather than using a direct count model based on a Poisson framework, the IHME approach models the log of the excess rate as a function of covariates, without any weighting, so that the population sizes of the different countries do not feed into the uncertainty calculation. A fundamental problem with the overall approach is that the uncertainty intervals are constructed in a non-standard and ad hoc way, so that the confidence intervals, in particular, will not be accurate representations of the true uncertainty. The Economist approach models the excess rate with a flexible tree-based machine learning technique, gradient boosting. The approach is clearly described and uses a resampling technique, the bootstrap, to form interval estimates, but there is no theory to support the use of the bootstrap with boosting, and so again, the uncertainty intervals should be viewed sceptically. A full description and critique of the alternative methods are available in Knutson et al.15. In the Supplementary information, we provide a comparison between point and interval country estimates obtained by the methods of the WHO, IHME and The Economist.\n\nP-scores\n\nRecall that the P-score is defined as the ratio of the excess to the expected, expressed as a percentage. Mathematically, this corresponds to,\n\n$${\\text{PS}}_{c,t}=100\\times \\frac{{Y}_{c,t}-{E}_{c,t}}{{E}_{c,t}},$$\n\nand \\({\\text{PS}}_{c,t}\\ge -100,\\) with zero deaths corresponding to –100, negative values corresponding to fewer deaths than expected and larger positive values corresponding to increasing levels of relative excess mortality. Under the model (2), we have \\(\\text{E}\\left[{Y}_{c,t}\\right]={E}_{c,t}{\\theta }_{c,t}\\) so that\n\n$$\\text{E}\\left[{\\text{PS}}_{c,t}\\right]=100\\times \\left({\\theta }_{c,t}-1\\right).$$\n\nFor countries whose ACM is unobserved, the rate is modelled via the log-linear form (equation (3)) which gives a specific form to the manner in which we assume the P-score changes as a function of country-specific covariates.\n\nRankings\n\nA natural, if sometimes unfortunate, inclination is to attempt to rank regions or countries in terms of the various metrics. Statistically, this is fraught with difficulties. The easiest approach, which is often followed in the media, is to simply rank on the basis of a point estimate of the metric, such as the mean or the median. The obvious problem with this approach is that the uncertainty in estimation is not accounted for. Using the Bayesian machinery that we use for inference we can account for the uncertainty probabilistically. In the simplest case of two countries, let \\({X}_{1}\\) and \\({X}_{2}\\) represent the excess rates in countries 1 and 2, respectively. We can then evaluate the (posterior) probability that \\({X}_{1} > {X}_{2}\\), and report this, rather than a binary statement that country 1 has a higher rate than country 2. The extension to multiple countries is immediate, as is the ability to calculate the probability of a higher rate in one country as compared to any collection of other countries.\n\nFor illustration of the issues of assessing rankings, we select six European countries that have overlap in their excess rate uncertainty (that is, posterior) distributions. In the left panel of Extended Data Fig. 3 we display posterior distributions for the excess rates of the six countries, ordered from top to bottom by highest to lowest median excess rate. There is clearly overlap in many of the distributions, but quantitative statements on the rankings require more than these plots. In the right panel of Extended Data Fig. 3 we present scatterplot representations of the bivariate probability distributions describing the relationships between pairs of countries. The red lines offer a reference by which we can evaluate the ranking probabilities (by calculating the fractions of points that are either side of the line). For example, the probabilities that the rate for Slovenia is greater than that of each of Italy, Estonia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Portugal are 0.546, 0.749, 0.988, 0.992 and 0.999, respectively. Even these plots do not give the complete picture as they are two-dimensional summaries of a six-dimensional object (the probability distribution over the six rates). We can provide other summaries, for example, the probability that the rate in Slovenia is greater than the rates in all of the other five countries is 0.479.\n\nThe rankings just discussed are based on the cumulative excess rate over January 2020–December 2021. Another potentially interesting summary is the relative rankings of countries’ rates over time. In Extended Data Fig. 4 we plot the excess rate over time (top panel) and the ranking probabilities (bottom panels). In each month, we calculate the probabilities that the rate of each country is highest, second highest and so on. In 2020, we see that among the six countries considered, Spain, the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent Italy, have high rates, whereas in 2021, Italy and Slovenia and to a lesser extent Spain have high rates. The rate in Estonia is generally low, apart from the last few months of 2021.\n\nThe Supplementary information contains a more substantive example where we consider the rankings of 27 countries of the European Union and the United Kingdom over time, in terms of both the excess rate and the P-score.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60762032', 'Headline': 'Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?', 'Snippet': 'The zero-Covid model was therefore strictly enforced both in mainland China and Hong Kong. ... in countries that have achieved widespread vaccination and natural infection rates, it may be less ...', 'Full_text': 'For the last two years, China\'s strict measures to contain Covid, enforced by swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions, seemed to be largely paying off.\n\nAs the rest of the world grappled with surges in cases and deaths in 2020, China\'s President Xi Jinping declared the country\'s handling of the pandemic through lockdowns and widespread testing a success - and touted its methods as being the most effective in dealing with the virus.\n\nThe zero-Covid model was therefore strictly enforced both in mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nBut things soon began to change.\n\nThe first signs of strain on the much-vaunted zero-Covid model in China began to appear when authorities were forced to impose increasingly large lockdowns triggered by the more infectious Delta variant in 2021. These started to raise questions about how long China could maintain this policy.\n\nAnd now Omicron has called it further into question.\n\nIn mainland China, thousands of cases are now being reported each day and millions of people in the north-eastern province of Jilin have been placed under lockdown - the first time China had restricted an entire province since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan.\n\nHong Kong, which was previously almost untouched by the virus, is now seeing 30,000 cases and more than 200 deaths a day. The city\'s healthcare system has been overrun, with shocking images of people in need of hospital care receiving rudimentary treatment outside medical facilities.\n\nIt\'s a situation unlike anything the country has seen for the past two years.\n\nOfficially, the Chinese government has not budged from its zero-Covid position. But there have been some signs that it may be softening its stance on how best to deal with the virus.\n\nEarlier this week, China\'s National Health Commission said it was changing its rules so that mild cases would be isolated in centralised locations, rather than treated in hospitals. The criteria for a patient to be discharged from quarantine has also been lowered.\n\n""In the past, China would actually admit every patient - whether they were asymptomatic or with just mild symptoms - to the hospital,"" Prof Jin Dong-yan of The University of Hong Kong told the BBC.\n\n""The fact they\'re now proposing to [locally isolate] them - that\'s one step to show they recognise that there\'s a large group of people that do not need much help.""\n\nDuring China\'s recent National People\'s Congress meeting, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also said China would continue to make its Covid-19 response more ""scientific and targeted"".\n\n""[Premier Li\'s speech] hints that the government is ready to be more flexible and loosen restrictions gradually,"" said Prof Chen Gang of the National University of Singapore.\n\n""Under [a more] dynamic policy, more emphasis will be placed on striking a balance between disease control and enabling people to live normal lives.""\n\nOn the ground as well, there\'s also been a noticeable shift in attitudes.\n\nLast year, top Chinese epidemiologist Zhang Wenhong suggested that China would eventually need to ""co-exist"" with the virus. He was met with a barrage of criticism, with some calling him a traitor, and others saying he was colluding with foreign forces to undermine China\'s Covid response.\n\nBut just this week, Dr Zhang posted another message on Chinese social media that got a very different reception.\n\nWhile he said that it was necessary for China to maintain its zero-Covid strategy for now, he added that it should not be afraid to eventually move towards a more ""sustainable coping strategy"" in the future.\n\n""With this virus, alleviating fear is the first step we must take,"" he said. ""Omicron has become so mild, in countries that have achieved widespread vaccination and natural infection rates, it may be less deadly than even the flu.""\n\nThis time, he was not met with vitriol - and was instead widely praised.\n\n""Thank you Dr Zhang for your scientific and rational [take] on issues,"" one comment said.\n\nOthers shared their struggles over the past years - a sign of growing frustration after more than two years of lockdowns.\n\n""These past few years, I have suffered a lot. I have lost my freedom - all in the name of the virus,"" one said.\n\nAccording to Professor Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, there is a sense that ""public support for zero-Covid is in decline"".\n\n""My sense is that especially in bigger cities like Shanghai, some people are saying it\'s just too much. While there\'s still overall public support for zero-Covid - it\'s being undermined by the recent Omicron wave,"" he said.\n\nSo how much longer can China hold on?\n\nExperts say we are unlikely to see any big moves this year, especially not now while it is in the throes of its biggest outbreak in years.\n\nMany believe loosening restrictions now could lead to an overwhelmed healthcare system - and a huge spike in the death rate.\n\nAll mainland China needs to do is look to Hong Kong to see a city struggling to contain its outbreak, with morgues filled to capacity and hospitals swamped with patients.\n\nProf Huang says China\'s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been proclaiming the fact that it has avoided a significant number of deaths, and ""there is no doubt that opening will lead to a rapid increase in cases"".\n\n""The dilemma is do you want to accept short-term pain - a significant increase of cases, deaths - for long-term stability?""\n\nAnalysts believe the answer is unlikely to be yes - especially right now.\n\n""If restrictions are loosened, the number of deaths may shoot up, leading to social panic - something that will not be allowed in the politically sensitive year of the 20th party congress,"" said Prof Chen.\n\nThis Chinese Communist Party 20th party congress is one of the country\'s most important political events of the decade, and on paper, was when President Xi Jinping was supposed to step down, having come to the end of his two term-limit in office.\n\nBut this limit was removed and there is growing certainty that Mr Xi will secure another term in power as party chief and come out of the congress ""more powerful than ever"", according to Michael Cunningham of research institution the Heritage Foundation.\n\n""The government usually shifts the pendulum toward preserving stability in party congress years, as those in power seek to avoid crises rather than make bold decisions that, if unsuccessful, could negatively impact their career prospects,"" said Mr Cunningham in a report. , external\n\nMr Xi himself said in a politburo meeting on Thursday that China would stick to its dynamic zero-Covid policy, saying: ""Victory comes from perseverance"".\n\nWith this clear instruction coming from the top, its more likely that officials will instead put in place smaller and gradual measures, similar to those already being made - but with no ""fundamental"" change - for now.\n\n""The problem with the zero-Covid policy is that it doesn\'t accept risks,"" says Prof Huang.\n\n""And unless [the Chinese government] is no longer obsessed with worst-case scenarios, you cannot expect to see a fundamental change to its policy.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00554-0', 'Headline': '‘COVID zero’ regions struggle with vaccine complacency - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Its ‘dynamic zero COVID-19’ policy is being put to the test as daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed to 56,000 this week and deaths reached 246 on 1 March. ...

Mass testing and mass quarantining are now things of the past.\n\nJust as dramatic as the policy shifts is the shift in messaging coming from the public health experts the Chinese government has relied on since the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, risking their credibility ahead of what is likely to be a giant wave of infections.\n\nTwo months ago, Dr. Liang Wannian, the architect of zero-COVID policy, said China ""cannot tolerate"" a wave of mass infections. This month, he said, ""The virus is much more mild now.""\n\nIf Liang was shifting focus to less stringent protocols, another prominent public health expert, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a pulmonologist who made his name fighting the SARS outbreak, made outright misleading claims about the virus. He went from touting China\'s mass quarantine strategy in May to telling a state media outlet that he hasn\'t seen cases of COVID-19 causing obvious long-term organ damage.\n\nMany studies have shown that COVID can cause chronic health issues, including heart problems and brain damage.\n\nZhong also said that 78% of patients infected with the Omnicron variant won\'t be reinfected for quite a long time. Studies suggest protection against reinfection declines dramatically over time and most people will be reinfected every one to two years.\n\n""Did Omicron mutate, or did the experts?""\n\nThe about-face did not go unnoticed on the Chinese internet. Posts juxtaposing several experts\' TV appearances before and after state policy change - including Zhong and Liang - have garnered more than 100,000 views.\n\n""Did Omicron mutate, or did the experts?"" one poster wrote.\n\nNot all public health and medical experts have changed their views. Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease director of a Shanghai hospital affiliated with Fudan University, said the zero-COVID policy should be relaxed even before an outbreak in Shanghai shut the city down for weeks. That position had initially attracted some attacks online though now he\'s being praised for speaking truth to power.\n\nWu Fan, a member of Shanghai\'s disease outbreak containment expert commission famous for insisting that Shanghai could not shut down is now receiving apologies online.\n\nWhiplash aside, much of the online discussion has moved to how to deal with the aftermath of the policy change, including what preventative measures and treatments are available.\n\nUntested remedies flourished\n\nUntested remedies to fight COVID have again flourished in recent days. An internal medicine doctor who\'s a member of China\'s prestigious Academy of Engineering recommended the unproven method of rinsing out your mouth using iced salt water daily. Commenters online were baffled. ""Wasn\'t salt water rinse debunked two years ago? Does an iced version make a difference?"" one wrote in a blog post.\n\nA local government in southwest China suggested making tea out of orange peels and monk fruit - both common ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine - to prevent infection. Dr. Zhong said weeks ago that he hasn\'t found any medication that is effective at preventing a COVID infection.\n\nThe chaos and uncertainty right now reminds Chen Wenhong, an associate professor of media studies and sociology at University of Texas, of the atmosphere in early 2020 when COVID was first spreading. ""It\'s kind of flying in the dark.""\n\nInformation gap\n\nFor most people in China, state media and health professionals are the most-trusted sources for information about COVID-19, according to surveys conducted in 2020. And with access to the global internet cut off for most, there are few alternatives to state media and its constellation of aligned social media accounts, says Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nPrivate outlets could provide better information though they do not have the same reach, he says.\n\nAdditionally, non-state media outlets are vulnerable to government crackdowns. Ding Xiangyuan was a well-read online health information outlet that debunked health myths and criticized the government\'s promotion of traditional Chinese medicine as well as the zero-COVID policy before it was suspended from popular social media platforms in August. Its accounts on the popular Chinese social media site, Weibo, remain silent today.\n\nAnother challenge is that Chinese news outlets often translate COVID misinformation from English-language sources and share it with their audience. ""It doesn\'t matter whether [the sources] are reputable or not,"" says Huang. ""They find anything that they thought would be useful to them, they start to translate that into Chinese, and start to spread it, and it becomes viral.""\n\nA recent example was how the Communist Party-controlled newspaper, The Global Times, cited a misleading report in the British tabloid, Daily Mail, that suggested without evidence that vaccine maker Moderna manufactured the virus. The Global Times extensively cited the coverage, using it to attack other unsupported theories about the virus\'s origin, including the one that suggested it leaked from a government research lab in Wuhan. Other smaller social media accounts made videos of the report, putting ""British Media"" in the headlines.\n\nInformation from overseas doesn\'t just come from newspapers, but also from the millions of Chinese nationals living abroad.\n\n""The Chinese diaspora has played a very useful role here to share with people back in China about their personal COVID experience,"" Chen says, ""knowing that in most cases it will not be that serious.""\n\nShe points out that while researchers and journalists often pay attention to social media discourse, many rural, often elderly residents rely on television and family members in larger cities to stay informed. Many are vulnerable to the disease, live in places where healthcare resources are scarce, and aren\'t adept at finding information on social media.\n\nWith the disease rapidly cascading from large cities to towns and villages, the Chinese government needs to act fast to get medically-sound public health messages out to the most vulnerable people, says Chen.\n\nSo far, both Chen and Huang say it\'s too early to tell what effect the health messaging whiplash will have.\n\nImplications for the next pandemic\n\nAbrupt changes in public health messaging is not a new or uniquely Chinese challenge. At various stages in the pandemic, many countries have changed course around what healthcare messages to send. Early on, there was a lot of back-and-forth about whether masks and facial coverings would lessen the spread of the virus, including in the United States.\n\nAs NPR reported, public health authorities don\'t base their messages for the public entirely on science - many considerations are also pragmatic and culturally-based.\n\nChen says that scientists have some soul searching to do in the next couple of years. ""If we know that politics is going to play a role in public health and also in science, how do we conduct ourselves? What [are] our ethics?""\n\n""When the next pandemic comes, what would be the best message?""\n\nMichaeleen Doucleff and John Ruwitch contributed reporting.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25433800-100-zero-covid-strategies-are-being-ditched-but-they-were-the-best-option/', 'Headline': 'Zero-covid strategies are being ditched, but they were the best option', 'Snippet': 'A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread. The one big downside is that maintaining border controls hurt trade and tourism .', 'Full_text': 'IT HAS been two years since the World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and governments are still changing tack. One of the biggest shifts has been the abandonment of the “zero covid” strategy by countries like New Zealand and Vietnam, which are opening up and allowing the virus to spread.\n\nAs a result, it is tempting to think the approach was a mistake and that the strategy of nations like the UK has won out. But that is nonsense. Countries that followed the zero-covid playbook have done better on every measure, from death rates to economic growth. If more nations had implemented this approach, humanity would be in a better place. When the next pandemic emerges, governments should consider trying to eliminate it using zero-covid methods.\n\nThere is no single definition of a zero-covid strategy, but it generally means reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus as much as possible. This typically entails a rapid lockdown once the virus is detected in the community, followed by reopening once cases have fallen, combined with a robust system for testing, tracing chains of infection and supporting those who need to self-isolate.\n\nThe most obvious benefit is that far fewer people die. As of 18 March, New Zealand had seen 151 confirmed deaths from covid-19, or 0.003 per cent of its population – even though the virus repeatedly snuck into the country. In contrast, more than 164,000 people are confirmed to have died in the UK, which is 0.24 per cent of the population.\n\nZero-covid policies also cause less economic harm. When the virus is barely present, people feel confident going out, so the economy can reopen more fully. There is an economic cost to the initial lockdown, but many nations that allowed the virus to spread have also had lockdowns to save their health systems and so paid the same costs – and their lockdowns were often longer. A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread. The one big downside is that maintaining border controls hurt trade and tourism. But overall, zero-covid nations did better economically.\n\nAlthough zero covid was a successful strategy for countries like New Zealand, they are now abandoning it. A key factor has been the evolution of the virus. The delta variant was far more transmissible than the original virus, and the newer omicron variant is more transmissible still. These new variants can only be halted by truly draconian measures, so governments that previously banked on elimination have been forced to let the virus in.\n\nIf the target of zero covid is now being ditched, does that mean it was a failure? A crude answer would be: only if you think saving lives and preserving economic growth constitutes a misstep.\n\nLet’s go further. Consider what would have happened if, in early 2020, every country able to had adopted a zero-covid policy. It is incontestable that the global death count would be far lower, fewer people would have long covid and the economic damage would have been reduced. The virus would still be spreading, but slowly, and rising rates of vaccination would control it further. Crucially, omicron probably wouldn’t have had the chance to evolve.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, governments like the UK’s asserted that eliminating the virus was utterly impractical and so it was necessary to let it pass through the population in a “controlled” manner. Two years on, we know that was wrong.\n\nWhen the next pandemic emerges – as it will – governments should remember zero covid, and work together to eliminate the new threat if they feasibly can. Coordinated international action is hard, but we must learn to do it.\n\nMichael Marshall is a science writer in Devon, UK, and author of The Genesis Quest'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00873-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Zero COVID in China: what next? - The Lancet', 'Snippet': ""The zero-COVID strategy has been the pillar of China's anti-epidemic policies for over 2 years.

Wage levels in 87 of the 89 smaller counties were below the national average of $1,418 in the fourth quarter of 2021. (See table 2.)\n\nLarge county wage changes\n\nTwelve of the 13 largest Illinois counties reported average weekly wage gains from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021. (See chart 2.) Seven counties had rates of wage gains that were above the national rate of 5.9 percent. Lake County had the largest gain (+13.1 percent). Over-the-year wage changes among Illinois’ other 12 large counties ranged from 8.5 percent to -0.3 percent.\n\nAmong the 343 largest counties in the United States, 334 had over-the-year wage increases. Palm Beach, FL, had the largest percentage wage increase (+15.6 percent). Kitsap, WA, had the largest over-the-year percentage decrease (-5.5 percent).\n\nLarge county average weekly wages\n\nWeekly wages in the 3 of the 13 largest counties in Illinois were above the national average of $1,418 in the fourth quarter of 2021. These three counties ranked among the top 20 percent nationwide: Lake ($1,842, 17th), Cook ($1,671, 31st), and DuPage ($1,567, 51st).\n\nAmong the largest U.S. counties, 84 reported average weekly wages above the U.S. average in the fourth quarter of 2021. Santa Clara, CA, had the highest average weekly wage at $4,005. Average weekly wages were below the national average in the remaining 259 counties. At $826 a week, Hidalgo, TX, had the lowest average weekly wage.\n\nAverage weekly wages in Illinois’ smaller counties\n\nAmong the 89 smaller counties in Illinois—those with employment below 75,000—Rock Island County ($1,617) and Putnam County ($1,490) reported an average weekly wage above the national average. Pope County ($659) reported the lowest average weekly wage in the state.\n\nWhen all 102 counties in Illinois were considered, 22 reported average weekly wages of less than $850, 25 registered wages from $850 to $949, 29 had wages from $950 to $1,049, and 26 had average weekly wages of $1,050 or higher.

For additional information about quarterly employment and wages data, please read the Technical Note or visit www.bls.gov/cew.\n\nEmployment and Wages Annual Averages Online features comprehensive information by detailed industry on establishments, employment, and wages for the nation and all states. This publication is typically published in September of the following year of the reference period or shortly after the QCEW first quarter full data update. The Employment and Wages Annual Averages Online is available at www.bls.gov/cew/publications/employment-and-wages-annual-averages/.\n\nThe County Employment and Wages release for first quarter 2022 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, August 24, 2022.\n\nThe County Employment and Wages full data update for first quarter 2022 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, September 7, 2022.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nAverage weekly wage data by county are compiled under the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program, also known as the ES-202 program. The data are derived from summaries of employment and total pay of workers covered by state and federal unemployment insurance (UI) legislation and provided by State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). The average weekly wage values are calculated by dividing quarterly total wages by the average of the three monthly employment levels of those covered by UI programs. The result is then divided by 13, the number of weeks in a quarter. It is to be noted, therefore, that over-the-year wage changes for geographic areas may reflect shifts in the composition of employment by industry, occupation, and such other factors as hours of work. Thus, wages may vary among counties, metropolitan areas, or states for reasons other than changes in the average wage level. Data for all states, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), counties, and the nation are available on the BLS web site at www.bls.gov/cew. However, data in QCEW press releases have been revised and may not match the data contained on the Bureau’s web site.\n\nQCEW data are not designed as a time series. QCEW data are simply the sums of individual establishment records reflecting the number of establishments that exist in a county or industry at a point in time. Establishments can move in or out of a county or industry for a number of reasons–some reflecting economic events, others reflecting administrative changes.\n\nThe preliminary QCEW data presented in this release may differ from data released by the individual states as well as from the data presented on the BLS web site. These potential differences result from the states’ continuing receipt, review and editing of UI data over time. On the other hand, differences between data in this release and the data found on the BLS web site are the result of adjustments made to improve over-the-year comparisons. Specifically, these adjustments account for administrative (noneconomic) changes such as a correction to a previously reported location or industry classification. Adjusting for these administrative changes allows users to more accurately assess changes of an economic nature (such as a firm moving from one county to another or changing its primary economic activity) over a 12-month period. Currently, adjusted data are available only from BLS press releases.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

The job openings rate nationally was 6.0 percent in February and 6.4 percent in January. (See table 3.) All data in this release are seasonally adjusted.\n\nThe ratio of unemployed persons per job opening in Illinois was 0.7 in February. Nationwide, 31 states and the District of Columbia had ratios in February that were lower than the national measure of 0.6 unemployed persons per job opening; 12 states had ratios that were higher than the national ratio, and 7 states had ratios equal to the national measure. (See map 1.)\n\nIn February, Illinois had 253,000 hires and 212,000 separations, compared to 254,000 hires and 218,000 separations in January. (See chart 2.) Over the 12 months ending in February, hires have averaged 255,000 per month and separations have averaged 218,000 per month. These averages include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year.\n\nAmong the February separations in Illinois, 130,000 were quits and 70,000 were layoffs and discharges, compared to 136,000 quits and 73,000 layoffs and discharges in January. (See chart 3.) Over the last 12 months, quits averaged 147,000 per month, ranging from 120,000 to 178,000.

The JOLTS program provides information on labor demand and turnover. The state estimates produced by JOLTS are model-based incorporating JOLTS sample, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), and Current Employment Statistics (CES) estimates. For more information see the JOLTS State Estimates Methodology.\n\nJob Openings. Job openings include all positions that are open on the last business day of the reference month. A job is open only if it meets all three of these conditions:\n\nA specific position exists and there is work available for that position.\n\nThe job could start within 30 days.\n\nThe employer is actively recruiting workers from outside the establishment to fill the position.\n\nThe number of unemployed persons per job opening is a ratio of the level of unemployed persons and the level of job openings. The number of unemployed persons at the national level is an estimate from the Current Population Survey (CPS), while state-level unemployment estimates are modeled by the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program. A ratio of 1.0 means there is a job available for every unemployed person. Lower ratios signal tighter labor markets, where firms have more job openings than there are unemployed persons available to work. Higher ratios indicate there are more unemployed persons competing for each job opening.\n\nHires. Hires include all additions to the payroll during the entire reference month.\n\nSeparations. Separations include all separations from the payroll during the entire reference month and is reported by type of separation: quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations.\n\nQuits include employees who left voluntarily, except for retirements or transfers to other locations.\n\nLayoffs and discharges include involuntary separations initiated by the employer.\n\nOther separations include retirements, transfers to other locations, separations due to employee disability, and deaths.\n\nLevels and rates of other separations represent a small portion of total separations and are not published with the release of state estimates.\n\nComplete definitions, including exclusions, and additional information about the State JOLTS data presented in this release are available in the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover Technical Note.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

The data are derived from summaries of employment and total pay of workers covered by state and federal unemployment insurance (UI) legislation and provided by State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). The average weekly wage values are calculated by dividing quarterly total wages by the average of the three monthly employment levels of those covered by UI programs. The result is then divided by 13, the number of weeks in a quarter. It is to be noted, therefore, that over-the-year wage changes for geographic areas may reflect shifts in the composition of employment by industry, occupation, and such other factors as hours of work. Thus, wages may vary among counties, metropolitan areas, or states for reasons other than changes in the average wage level. Data for all states, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), counties, and the nation are available on the BLS web site at www.bls.gov/cew. However, data in QCEW press releases have been revised and may not match the data contained on the Bureau’s web site.\n\nQCEW data are not designed as a time series. QCEW data are simply the sums of individual establishment records reflecting the number of establishments that exist in a county or industry at a point in time. Establishments can move in or out of a county or industry for a number of reasons–some reflecting economic events, others reflecting administrative changes.\n\nThe preliminary QCEW data presented in this release may differ from data released by the individual states as well as from the data presented on the BLS web site. These potential differences result from the states’ continuing receipt, review and editing of UI data over time. On the other hand, differences between data in this release and the data found on the BLS web site are the result of adjustments made to improve over-the-year comparisons. Specifically, these adjustments account for administrative (noneconomic) changes such as a correction to a previously reported location or industry classification. Adjusting for these administrative changes allows users to more accurately assess changes of an economic nature (such as a firm moving from one county to another or changing its primary economic activity) over a 12-month period. Currently, adjusted data are available only from BLS press releases.\n\nFor more information see the Technical Note for the County Employment and Wages News Release.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

Regional Commissioner Jason Palmer noted that the six alternative measures of labor underutilization in Illinois were significantly lower than the rates recorded a year ago. Nationally, all six measures had significant decreases over the year. (See table 1. The Technical Note at the end of this release provides additional information on the reliability of estimates.)\n\nThe official concept of unemployment, U-3 in the U-1 to U-6 range of measures, includes all jobless persons who are available to take a job and have actively sought work in the past 4 weeks. In Illinois, 4.4 percent of the labor force was unemployed, as measured by U-3 in 2022, significantly higher than the national rate of 3.6 percent. (See chart 1.) The official measure of unemployment in states is derived using a statistical model that incorporates data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and other sources, and this model-based estimate can differ from the direct CPS estimate discussed here.\n\nIllinois had 283,000 unemployed residents in 2022 according to the CPS. In addition, there were 153,900 workers who were employed part time for economic reasons (also known as involuntary part time). These individuals were working part time because of slack work or business conditions or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See chart 2.) Nationwide, there were 3.93 million individuals working part time for economic reasons in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the number of individuals considered to be marginally attached to the labor force in Illinois was 62,200. People marginally attached to the labor force are not working, but indicate that they would like to work, are available to work, and have looked for work at some time during the past 12 months, even though they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. In the United States, the number of people marginally attached totaled 1.48 million in 2022.\n\nDiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, are persons who are not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. In 2022, there were 17,000 discouraged workers in Illinois, accounting for 27 percent of the marginally attached in the state. The U-4 measure, which adds discouraged workers to the number of the unemployed (expressed as a percentage of the labor force plus the number of discouraged workers), was 4.6 percent in Illinois, significantly higher than the 3.9-percent rate for the nation.\n\nState comparisons\n\nIn 2022, 13 states had rates significantly lower than those of the U.S. for all six measures of labor underutilization, while 5 states had rates higher than those of the U.S. for all six measures. (See table 2.)\n\nThe U-4 rate includes discouraged workers; thus, the difference between U-3 and U-4 reflects the degree of would-be job-seeker discouragement. At the national level, the difference between U-3 and U-4 was +0.3 percentage point in 2022. No state had a noteworthy difference between these two measures.\n\nThe U-5 rate includes all people who are marginally attached to the labor force, and U-6 adds those who are involuntary part-time workers. Therefore, the larger the difference between U-5 and U-6, the higher the incidence of this form of ""underemployment."" In 2022, 49 states and the District of Columbia had significant differences between their U-5 and U-6 rates. California had the largest gap (+3.4 percentage points), followed by Hawaii (+3.1 points) and Colorado and New York (+3.0 points each). At the national level, the difference between U-5 and U-6 was +2.4 percentage points.\n\nMeasures of labor underutilization saw more prevalent declines in 2022 relative to 2021, reflecting continued improvement in the national labor market. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia had significant declines in all six measures over the year. For each measure, between 37 states and the District (U-6) and 48 states and the District (U-1) showed significant improvement over the year. The largest U-6 decline occurred in Nevada (-4.6 percentage points), followed by Hawaii (-4.4 points) and California (-4.2 points). Seven other states had U-6 rate declines of at least 3.0 percentage points. No state had an over-the-year rate increase in any measure.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces six measures of labor underutilization based on Current Population Survey (CPS) data. Monthly, the BLS publishes these six measures for the United States in the Employment Situation news release. (See www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm.) State estimates, presented as 4-quarter averages, are provided each quarter on the BLS website. (For the most recent data see www.bls.gov/lau/stalt.htm.)\n\nThe official concept of unemployment (as measured in the CPS) is equivalent to the U-3 in the U-1 to U-6 range of measures. The other measures are provided to data users and analysts who want more narrowly (U-1 and U-2) or broadly (U-4 through U-6) defined measures.\n\nThe unemployment rates (U-3) in this release are derived directly from the CPS, because this is the only source of data for the various components of the alternative measures. As a result, these U-3 measures may differ from the official state annual average unemployment rates. The latter are estimates developed from statistical models that greatly improve the reliability of the top-side labor force and unemployment estimates.

Mike Wilson, believes earnings losses in 2023 could rival those of 2008.', 'Full_text': 'Analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicates Illinois lost jobs during Q2 rather than gaining, as previously reported. It may still be losing jobs. Illinois ranked No. 2 for highest unemployment in November.\n\nIllinois’ employment gains have been overestimated, showing a gain when they should have shown a loss in the spring, according to a report Dec. 13 from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nThose losses may be continuing, as the state ranked No. 2 in November for highest unemployment in the U.S.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Employment Security in conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics originally estimated the state added 35,800 jobs from mid-March through mid-June 2022. The Fed reported more detailed data shows that was wrong: the state lost jobs during that time.\n\nThe overestimation of job gains, which are calculated based on Current Employer Survey data, may help to explain why Illinois’ unemployment rate continues to increase despite the state reporting job growth. Illinois’ unemployment rate of 4.7% is second highest in the nation, behind only Nevada.\n\nState unemployment figures, which are based on household survey data, suggest employment in Illinois has been declining since August.\n\nBecause of the conflicting estimates, the Illinois Department of Employment Security continues to report the state is adding jobs, reportedly gaining 17,500 jobs in November.\n\nLeading the month’s job growth was the leisure and hospitality sector with 10,700 jobs added; professional and business services added 5,800 jobs; education and health added 3,500 jobs; construction added 2,400 jobs for the month; and financial services and other services added 1,400 jobs and 1,000 jobs, respectively.\n\nDespite overall job growth for November, five of the state’s 11 sectors suffered job losses for the month. Leading the losses for November was the trade, transportation and utilities sector as it shed 4,300 jobs; the government sector lost 1,700 jobs; manufacturing lost 1,000 jobs, while the information sector lost 200 jobs and mining lost 100 in November.\n\nDespite continued estimates of jobs growth, Illinois is still missing 41,500 jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, while the analysis from the Federal Reserve suggests this number may be even larger. There will be a clearer picture of Illinois’ labor market when the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts benchmark revisions to their estimates in March 2023.\n\nRegardless of what the data will ultimately show, Illinois’ labor market will have to contend with serious headwinds in the new year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve continued to pursue interest rate hikes in order combat inflation, boosting rates another 75 basis points for November. Inflation remained high at 7.1% for November. Interest rates are now the highest they have been since 2008 and the Great Recession, with the Fed continuing to signal more rate hikes are coming, although possibly at a slower pace. It raised its benchmark rate half a point Dec. 14 to a target range of 4.25 to 4.5% – the highest rate in 15 years. The Federal Reserve’s policymakers are predicting higher unemployment and slower economic growth in both 2023 and 2024, with the economy forecast to grow just 0.5% next year.\n\nOther recession warning signs have been making news recently. Fitch Ratings is expecting a recession by the second quarter of 2023. It stated a recession is likely to be similar to the 1990-1991 recession, which lasted nine months, but is also expected to be milder than the one from 30 years ago. A recent Bloomberg Economics model projects there is now a 100% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist & Chief Investment Officer, Mike Wilson, believes earnings losses in 2023 could rival those of 2008.\n\nThe concerning jobs and unemployment figures are a bad sign for Illinois’ economy should a downturn take place. Illinoisans suffered more than most Americans during the Great Recession. Because the state still hasn’t recovered from the pandemic, it remains vulnerable to suffering more severely than other states should a recession occur.\n\nIllinois has a tendency to struggle to recover from economic downturns compared to the rest of the nation, as it did after the Great Recession and is doing now after the pandemic. During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, Illinois’ economy shrank by nearly 5% compared to a 3.2% drop in the rest of the nation. Then it lagged the recovery from 2009 to 2017, growing by 10.6% while the rest of the nation grew by 17.1%.\n\nWith the passage of Amendment 1, Illinois’ $313 billion pension debt will likely continue to balloon as state and local taxes, which are already among the highest in the nation, rise in an attempt to keep up without reform to the pension system. If property taxes continue to rise at their recent rate, homeowners can expect to pay more than $2,100 during the next four years. Meanwhile, spending on vital programs will continue to be crowded out.'}}",92.5,2

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ashli-babbitt-mother-hanging-pelosi-b2404673.html', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt’s mother makes death threat against officer who shot ...', 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 riot, has called for the Capitol Police officer who shot her daughter to be hanged — along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, said to a crowd of people, reportedly outside of the DC jail: “The Capitol Police needs to be abolished, or at the very least investigated.”\n\nShe continued, “Michael Byrd needs to swing from the end of a rope, along with Nancy Pelosi.” Ms Pelosi was serving as Speaker of the House on January 6, 2021.\n\nMs Witthoeft has in the past posted a photo of Michael Byrd on X, formerly known as Twitter, writing, “Today is July 1, 2022 and Michael Byrd is still a murderer profiting from my daughter’s death.”\n\nThe Justice Department announced in April 2021 that it would “not pursue criminal charges against” Mr Byrd, as its investigation “revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.”\n\nStill, Babbitt’s mother has remained steadfast in her views.\n\nIn May, Ms Witthoeft was arrested and charged with simple assault — after pushing a counter-protester at a right-wing event outside a Washington DC jail — and destruction of property.\n\nShe was previously arrested in January this year in Washington DC while protesting on the second anniversary of the Capitol attack after a group of protesters, who didn’t have a permit to demonstrate on the Capitol grounds, tried to cross a street and enter the grounds.\n\nMs Witthoeft was arrested on two infractions: disobeying an order and blocking or obstructing a roadway.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2022/01/03/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence.

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nREAD MORE: Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nNorris later got a judicial order that barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Even so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents.

He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever. But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://wgnradio.com/news/political-news/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1106424721/state-officials-and-election-workers-say-they-faced-pressure-to-overturn-2020-re', 'Headline': 'State officials and election workers say they faced pressure to ...', 'Snippet': ""He also said Giuliani pressured him to call the Arizona legislature back into session, a unilateral move Bowers said he can't do, and to recall electors that were going to be for President Biden."", 'Full_text': 'MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nHere\'s one account of what Rudy Giuliani said as he worked to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRUSTY BOWERS: We\'ve got lots of theories, we just don\'t have the evidence.\n\nKELLY: Those were the words of former Trump lawyer Giuliani according to Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican. Bowers was one of several officials from key swing states testifying today before the House January 6 committee. They recounted pressure from Trump to overturn President Biden\'s victory, and they recounted the many ways their lives were upended as they tried to protect democracy.\n\nNPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales joins me from Capitol Hill. Hey, Claudia.\n\nCLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: All right, let\'s start with Rusty Bowers. He testified for about an hour. He gave all kinds of detail about how Trump and Giuliani personally pressured him. What else did we learn?\n\nGRISALES: Right. This was pretty powerful testimony from Bowers about the extent of the pressure and the threats he and his family faced from Trump and his allies. He said protesters were showing up to where he lived, threatening him and his family, blasting music in their neighborhood. And at one point, a man recently approached his neighbor.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBOWERS: And he had a pistol and was threatening my neighbor - not with the pistol, but just vocally. When I saw the gun, I knew I had to get close.\n\nGRISALES: And this was troubling for his family - his wife, who he called valiant, and a daughter who was gravely ill. Bowers had said Trump asked him to hold a hearing to investigate allegations of fraud in Arizona, but he said the evidence didn\'t merit a hearing. He said he told Trump and Giuliani that he would not break his oath. And there were many others who pressured Bowers, including lawyer John Eastman and Arizona GOP Congressman Andy Biggs.\n\nKELLY: You know, I\'m listening to this account of all the pressure coming from so many directions. It seems like that was a central theme today. Am I right here - that the...\n\nGRISALES: Right.\n\nKELLY: ...How democracy is upheld by big institutions, but also by individuals like Bowers?\n\nGRISALES: Exactly. For example, Chairman Bennie Thompson warned these kind of threats continue today. He was saying two weeks ago, a county commissioner in New Mexico refused to certify results in a primary election race using unsupported claims. And then returning to Bowers, Bowers called arguments by Trump and Giuliani and other allies trying to get Arizona to use fake electors as, quote, ""a tragic parody."" Bowers said that they choose to follow the will of the people. That\'s what he chose to do.\n\nHe also said Giuliani pressured him to call the Arizona legislature back into session, a unilateral move Bowers said he can\'t do, and to recall electors that were going to be for President Biden. So Bowers was emotional when he said, quote, ""it is a tenant of my faith that the Constitution is divinely inspired."" And he would not do it.\n\nKELLY: We also heard today from high-profile Trump allies who were part of this pressure campaign and this whole fake electors scheme. Who were they?\n\nGRISALES: Right. We heard about two members of Congress who were witnesses - or who witnesses said and evidence showed had ties to this pressure campaign. For example, Bowers said he got a call the morning of January 6 from Arizona GOP Congressman Andy Biggs, who was pressuring him to sign on to a letter to decertify these electors for Biden. Biggs is also facing a January 6 subpoena in refusing to cooperate.\n\nAnd then we also saw text messages from an aide to Wisconsin GOP Senator Ron Johnson, who told one of Pence\'s aides that Johnson could give then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors for his state and Michigan on January 6. But we should note a Johnson aide said today the senator was not personally involved in this effort.\n\nKELLY: We also heard from several Georgia witnesses about the threats they faced. What did they say?\n\nGRISALES: Right. This was really striking testimony here from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his deputy, Gabe Sterling. They were expanding on the pressure and threats they faced from their state, from Trump and his allies. Another witness from the state - this is Shaye Moss; this is a Fulton County election worker at the time - recounted how she and her mother had to go into hiding because of the threats they faced from the former president and his allies. For example, on a call, Trump attacked Shaye Moss and her mother 18 times. And Giuliani also spread outrageous, false rumors connecting her to drug use.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSHAYE MOSS: A lot of threats - wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I\'ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, be glad it\'s 2020 and not 1920.\n\nGRISALES: And so this leads into testimony we will hear from other witnesses in the coming days about this wide-ranging investigation into Trump\'s pressure campaign and January 6.\n\nKELLY: NPR\'s Claudia Grisales there on Capitol Hill.

Biden Jr. had won the state.\n\nThe scheme was part of a broader bid — one of the longest running and most complicated that Mr. Trump undertook as he sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 presidential election — to falsely manufacture a victory for him by creating fake slates of electors in battleground states who would claim that he had been the true winner.\n\nSome of the lawyers who undertook the effort doubted its legality, and the emails, which have not been previously reported, were the latest indication that other key players also knew they were on shaky legal ground, and took pains to create a rationale that could justify their actions.\n\nKenneth Chesebro, a lawyer working for Mr. Trump’s campaign, wrote in a Dec. 11, 2020, email to other members of the legal team that Ms. Ward and Ms. Townsend had raised concerns about casting votes as part of an alternate slate of electors because there was no pending legal challenge that could flip the results of Arizona’s election.\n\n“Ward and Townsend are concerned it could appear treasonous for the AZ electors to vote on Monday if there is no pending court proceeding that might, eventually, lead to the electors being ratified as the legitimate ones,” Mr. Chesebro wrote to the group, which included Rudolph W.

The federal indictment of Trump said this was part of a criminal conspiracy aimed at keeping him in office.\n\nThe Michigan electors were each charged with eight felonies and released on $1,000 bonds.\n\nAt least eight of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been offered immunity.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes\' office has said Arizona\'s electors are under investigation. The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/post-misrepresents-legal-power-of-arizona-resolution-on-electronic-voting-machines/', 'Headline': 'Post Misrepresents Legal Power of Arizona Resolution on Electronic ...', 'Snippet': 'In a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”. Fontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 ...', 'Full_text': 'Quick Take\n\nThe Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state. The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-censured-arizona-republican-party-house-january-6-committee-witness/', 'Headline': 'Arizona GOP censures Rusty Bowers, who testified before Jan. 6 House ...', 'Snippet': ""Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers describes Trump plan to replace electors 24:29.

Rand Paul was an opportunity for the GOP to, in a moment echoing one of the McCarthy era’s most notorious hearings ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-rand-paul-senate-hearing-claims/', 'Headline': 'Fauci derides Rand Paul in Senate hearing as COVID cases ... - CBS News', 'Snippet': ""Fauci fires back at Rand Paul during heated exchange 02:40.

Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106119', 'Headline': 'Federal Research: NIH Could Take Additional Actions to Manage Risks ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency.

In January 2023, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommended that NIH implement enhanced monitoring, documentation, and reporting requirements for award recipients with foreign subrecipients. To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3831891-watchdog-knocks-nih-oversight-of-alliance-that-oversaw-funds-to-wuhan-lab/', 'Headline': 'Watchdog knocks NIH oversight of alliance that oversaw funds to Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'In April 2020, NIH directed EcoHealth to stop providing funding to the Wuhan Institute due to concerns the lab may have been involved in the release of the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research.

Two key ..."", 'Full_text': 'What went wrong?\n\nAt year\'s end, that\'s the question being asked about the global effort to make sure that all countries get vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nAlmost as soon as the pandemic began, the world\'s leading health organizations joined forces to ensure an ample supply of the vaccines for all nations regardless of income level. The program they created is known as COVAX – short for the COVID-19 Global Access Facility. It was supposed to pre-purchase doses from the manufacturers while the vaccines were still being developed, and then – once the doses became available – distribute them to countries according to their need and charge according to their ability to pay, with the lowest income countries getting the doses for free.\n\nYet as 2021 comes to a close, and the omicron variant spreads across the globe, the vast majority of people in lower income countries remain unvaccinated.\n\nNPR spoke with two public health leaders with unique perspectives on this issue.\n\nSeth Berkley is head of GAVI the Vaccine Alliance — one of the organizations that formed COVAX (along with the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI.) Krishna Udayakumar directs Duke University\'s Global Health Innovation Center – which helped create an independent hub for tracking both the progress and the obstacles to COVID vaccine access.\n\nHere are eight takeaways:\n\nThe world is way behind on vaccination targets\n\nIn September President Joe Biden proposed a global goal of vaccinating at least 70% of the world\'s population by autumn of 2022. The United Nations and the World Health Organization argued the target should be met even sooner – by mid-2022 – and that by the close of 2021 at least 40% of people in every country should be vaccinated.\n\nIt\'s now clear that more than 90 countries will miss even that more modest 40% target. ""Some of these countries are in South and Southeast Asia, as well as some in Central and South America,"" notes Udayakumar. ""But the majority are in Sub-Saharan Africa.""\n\nWhat\'s more, he says, these countries haven\'t just missed the 40% target – they are often well below it. In the lower-income countries that qualify for free or highly subsidized vaccines from COVAX, ""the average vaccination rate is closer to 20% than 40% right now,"" says Udayakumar. And in sub-saharan Africa, many countries are stuck at vaccination rates in the single digits.\n\n""It\'s quite concerning because we know that this is leading to exactly the type of situation where infections are raging around the world,"" says Udayakumar. ""We\'re losing lives unnecessarily. We\'re seeing enormous economic damages. But it\'s also setting up the petri dish in essence to create new variants over time. All of us remain unsafe so long as we\'re not doing everything possible to more aggressively vaccinate.""\n\nThe situation would have been worse without COVAX ...\n\nAs disappointing as the progress has been, says Udayakumar, ""we would be in a worse situation than we are right now if COVAX didn\'t exist."" To date it has distributed more than 800 million doses of vaccine to more than 140 countries – ""many of which wouldn\'t get access to vaccines as quickly or in the amounts that they have otherwise.""\n\n... but COVAX was doomed to fall short\n\nUdayakumar says COVAX has ""fallen short"" due to ""naive thinking"" behind its set up – specifically a failure to anticipate that wealthy countries were going to rush to buy up virtually all of the vaccine supply from manufacturers through pre-purchase agreements.\n\nGAVI\'s Seth Berkley recalls how fierce the contest was. ""We were competing against countries that had opened their treasuries and had the [clout] to demand that vaccines flowed to them,"" he says.\n\nThe result was that once vaccines started becoming available, that early supply was almost entirely earmarked for wealthy countries. And vaccines are still only slowly making their way to the rest of the world, as wealthy countries continue to bring in many more doses than they are actually using each month.\n\nIndeed, says Udayakumar, the same problem has hampered a similar effort by African nations to band together to buy vaccines for their continent. The initiative – called the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, or AVATT – ""has agreements for hundreds of millions of doses. It has been able to deliver many fewer than that,"" notes Udayakumar. ""It\'s a matter of having paid for doses that haven\'t arrived yet. So the real challenge comes back to decision-making by high-income countries, as well as the manufacturers themselves, when they have sold three, four or five times what they can produce at any point in time, they\'re having to make decisions about who is getting doses first. And almost across the board those doses have gone to high-income countries first.""\n\nEarly funding for COVAX could have helped\n\nAdding to COVAX\'s difficulties, says Berkley: ""You\'d want to have financing on day one. We started with zero, and of course that meant we couldn\'t put orders in early,"" he says.\n\nEventually COVAX was able to raise funds from donor countries and organizations. But, says Berkley, ""it took us until the end of [2020] to get the first $2.4 billion in commitments."" Even at that point the cash actually delivered to COVAX was ""very low,"" he adds. ""I think $400 million.""\n\nIf COVAX had been fully funded from the start, says Berkley, ""even if you couldn\'t compete with the U.S. treasury or the European union, you might be able to do technology transfers."" Specifically, COVAX could have more quickly expanded the pool of vaccine suppliers by identifying manufacturing plants with the capacity to produce vaccines – then providing them the funding and assistance to learn how to produce some of the vaccine candidates.\n\nAs it was, COVAX only had the resources to work with a few companies, says Berkley – the most prominent of which was Serum Institute of India or SII. Then, last spring, soon after SII began producing doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, India was hit with a massive wave of cases. The government mandated that all of SII\'s COVID vaccines be redirected for India\'s domestic use. ""It meant that all of a sudden, the 350 million doses we had expected to have for [COVAX-supported] countries wasn\'t there,"" notes Berkley. The situation delayed the roll-out of vaccines to African countries in particular by months. And although India lifted the export ban last October, SII is only just ramping up the number of doses it is sending to COVAX.\n\nThe Serum Institute of India debacle may have been unavoidable\n\nAs problematic as COVAX\'s reliance on SII has proved, says Berkley, ""If today I was doing it, I would do exactly the same thing."" That\'s because faced with such limited funds, COVAX had to go with the company most likely to be capable of scaling up quickly. SII well suited to doing so – ""it\'s the largest manufacturer in the world [of vaccines] by volume,"" notes Berkley. But there also simply weren\'t that many other candidates.\n\nThere\'s a need for more vaccine manufacturers\n\nThis paucity of vaccine makers in developing countries needs to be fixed, says Udayakumar. ""The place where the vaccines are manufactured makes a huge difference,"" he says. ""We\'ve seen manufacturing that\'s been mostly in high-income countries as well as in India and China. And those are the regions that have gotten access to vaccines most quickly. We need now much more sustainable vaccine manufacturing across Sub-Saharan Africa as well as Latin America and south and Southeast Asia.""\n\nWhat it will take to make that happen is now the subject of lively and complex debate. But Udayakumar says at best it will take ""months to years"" to achieve.\n\nDonated doses are a short-term solution – but only if done right\n\nTo ease the current supply crunch COVAX is facing, it would be helpful for wealthy countries to to ramp up donations of excess vaccines that they\'ve already purchased, says Udayakumar. And already, he notes, ""almost 2 billion doses of vaccine have now been pledged to be donated mostly from high-income countries with over 1.1 billion of that pledge coming just from the U.S The U.S. has also shipped more than 300 million doses of donated vaccine, which is more than every other country combined at the moment.""\n\nUnfortunately, adds Udayakumar, ""maybe a quarter of what\'s been pledged has actually been shipped – much less gotten to the countries that need them.""\n\nBerkley adds that another difficulty is that those donated doses arrive ""sometimes with short shelf life. Also, he says, ""one of the challenges is to try to make sure those donations ideally, are not earmarked [for specific countries] ... and that we get enough time for countries to know they\'re coming, so countries can plan.""\n\nGetting enough vaccines is only the first hurdle COVAX faces\n\nWhile supply delays remain the biggest obstacle to increasing vaccination rates in lower income countries, Udayakumar says he\'s optimistic that the problem will soon be eased.\n\n""I think there are at least some glimmers of hope on the horizon in that the supplies are increasing rapidly.""\n\nMore worrying, he says, is a continued lack of adequate financing and preparation for the logistical task of administering doses. ""The greatest challenge is less about getting the vaccines from manufacturers to airports, and now much more about getting vaccines from airports to arms.""'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105', 'Headline': 'Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country', 'Snippet': 'Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 550 million confirmed cases and more than six million deaths reported across almost 200 countries.

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner. Vaccine drives are not a top priority for the Taliban, even though it has said it supports vaccination drives by COVAX and the U.N.\n\nNor is it a priority among Afghans. ""Right now there\'s such a dire humanitarian situation there,"" he says. ""[Afghans] are worried about getting food on the table, they\'re worried about feeding their kids. And so COVID is not a priority for the average person.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/04/scicheck-covid-19-data-comparing-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated-continues-to-be-available-contrary-to-viral-posts/', 'Headline': 'COVID-19 Data Comparing Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated Continue to Be ...', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 case and death rate data by vaccination status were last updated on March 17, and cover April 2021 to Feb. 19 for cases and through Jan. 29 for deaths.', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nWeekly rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths by vaccination status are published monthly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website.

The data on COVID-19 hospitalizations are collected by COVID-NET, a surveillance system that collects data on hospitalizations of children and adults with a confirmed infection through a network of over 250 hospitals in 14 states.\n\nThe data are used by the agency to better understand how well the vaccines are working against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAccording to this data, for example, unvaccinated people over 5 years old were 2.4 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 in January. And in February, unvaccinated adults ages 18 and older were 5 times more likely to have a COVID-19-associated hospitalization than fully vaccinated adults.\n\nThe COVID-19 case and death rate data by vaccination status were last updated on March 17, and cover April 2021 to Feb. 19 for cases and through Jan. 29 for deaths. The data for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations by vaccination status from January 2021 to Feb. 26 were posted on March 24, and then updated on March 31.\n\nThe agency has not communicated any intention to discontinue these publications.\n\n“The next update for rates of cases and deaths by vaccination status will be mid-April and include case data through mid-March and death data through late February.

Consult your local health department for the most up-to-date information on whether you are eligible to receive a vaccine. (You can often find a link in the table below.)\n\nFor comparison purposes, Reuters has standardized the names of rollout phases and priority groups. For groups given access based on complex conditions, such as where people work or a pre-existing medical condition, a more detailed description of that group is also included in the table.\n\nTap to know more\n\nInfections\n\n% of peak\n\nDeaths\n\n% of peak\n\nPercent of population given at least one dose of vaccine\n\nPercent given at least 1 dose of vaccine\n\nVaccination phase\n\n42%\n\n3%\n\nPeak\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n24%\n\n2%\n\n95%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n94%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n94%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n16%\n\n93%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n1%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n3%\n\n91%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n15%\n\n2%\n\n90%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n89%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n89%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n49%\n\n50%\n\n88%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n49%\n\n18%\n\n88%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n10%\n\n1%\n\n87%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n12%\n\n5%\n\n87%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n28%\n\n8%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n87%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n49%\n\n97%\n\n87%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n12%\n\n14%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n4%\n\n87%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n11%\n\n3%\n\n84%\n\n6\n\nof 6\n\n56%\n\n13%\n\n84%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n83%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n9%\n\n7%\n\n82%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n70%\n\n9%\n\n82%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n8%\n\n8%\n\n81%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n23%\n\n8%\n\n81%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n13%\n\n3%\n\n80%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n80%\n\n7%\n\n2%\n\n79%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n16%\n\n13%\n\n79%\n\n78%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n8%\n\n3%\n\n77%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n38%\n\n9%\n\n77%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n7%\n\n1%\n\n77%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n9%\n\n3%\n\n77%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n24%\n\n6%\n\n76%\n\n2\n\nof 3\n\n1%\n\n76%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n12%\n\n3%\n\n75%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n74%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n1%\n\n74%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n11%\n\n8%\n\n74%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n96%\n\n23%\n\n73%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n5%\n\n4%\n\n73%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n73%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n95%\n\n11%\n\n71%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n14%\n\n1%\n\n71%\n\n6\n\nof 6\n\n63%\n\n4%\n\n70%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n5%\n\n1%\n\n70%\n\n2\n\nof 3\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n70%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n69%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n16%\n\n3%\n\n68%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n67%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n2%\n\n65%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n1%\n\n65%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n20%\n\n1%\n\n64%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n64%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n63%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n24%\n\n1%\n\n63%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n32%\n\n5%\n\n61%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n59%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n13%\n\n7%\n\n56%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n56%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n55%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n43%\n\n55%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n53%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n51%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n50%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\nPeak\n\n22%\n\n50%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n49%\n\n3\n\nof 4\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n48%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n47%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n43%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n3%\n\n43%\n\n4\n\nof 5\n\n42%\n\n8%\n\n42%\n\n1\n\nof 3\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n39%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n39%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n38%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n37%\n\n3\n\nof 3\n\n5%\n\n35%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n35%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n4%\n\n35%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n11%\n\n35%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n35%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n2%\n\n33%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\n28%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n27%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n27%\n\n1%\n\n27%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n26%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n3%\n\n24%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n1%\n\n20%\n\n5\n\nof 5\n\n19%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n19%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n18%\n\n4\n\nof 4\n\n6%\n\n17%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n1%\n\n16%\n\n2\n\nof 2\n\n2%\n\n15%\n\n1\n\nof 2\n\n2%\n\n15%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n7%\n\n14%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n4%\n\n12%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n10%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n9%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n6%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n5%\n\n3%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n2%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\n17%\n\n2%\n\n1\n\nof 1\n\nData sources\n\nLocal state agencies, local media, Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker, Our World in Data, The World Bank, Reuters research\n\nDesign and development\n\nGurman Bhatia, Prasanta Kumar Dutta, Chris Canipe and Jon McClure\n\nData collection and research\n\nAbhishek Manikandan, Aditya Munjuluru, Ahmed Farhatha, Amal Maqbool, Aniruddha Chakrabarty, Anna Banacka, Anna Pruchnicka, Anurag Maan, Anuron Kumar Mitra, Arpit Nayak, Arundhati Sarkar, Cate Cadell, Chaithra J, Chinmay Rautmare, Christine Chan, Daniela Desantis, Diana Mandia Alvarez, Elizaveta Gladun, Emily Isaacman, Enrico Sciacovelli, Gautami Khandke, Gayle Issa, Hardik Vyas, Harshith Aranya, Javier Lopez, Joao Manuel Vicente Mauricio, Juliette Portala, K.
