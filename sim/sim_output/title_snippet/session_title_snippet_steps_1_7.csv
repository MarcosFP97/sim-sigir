The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration.

We used latent class growth analysis to determine patterns (or classes) of pandemic-related food insecurity during a 1-year period.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 10 classes of trajectories of food insecurity, including 1 class of consistent food security (64.7%), 1 class of consistent food insecurity (3.4%), 5 classes of decreasing food insecurity (15.8%), 2 classes of increasing food insecurity (4.6%), and 1 class of stable but elevated food insecurity (11.6%). Relative to the class that remained food secure, other classes were younger, had a greater proportion of women, and tended to identify with a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of food insecurity were highly variable across the US population, with one-third experiencing some form of food insecurity risk. Findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood insecurity — which occurs when access to adequate food to live a healthy life is limited by a lack of money or other resources — is a major public health problem in the US that contributes substantially to the burden of chronic disease and poor mental health (1). Food insecurity results in an estimated $77 billion each year in excess health care spending (2). More than 1 in 10 US households experienced food insecurity in 2020 (3). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce the national prevalence of food insecurity to 6%, and this is now the target for Healthy People 2030 (4).\n\nAlong with illness and death in the US (5) and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a cascade of economic and social disruptions that increased food insecurity, particularly in its earliest months (6). Data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey showed that food insufficiency (a severe form of food insecurity) rose from 8% in March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 (7). Some households, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino households and households with children, were found to be more vulnerable than other households to food insecurity as a result of the pandemic (3,7). In addition to these national prevalence studies, other studies have estimated food insecurity to be much higher in some samples (8,9); these studies differed in sample representation (online convenience vs community-based samples), study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), and food insecurity measures (single vs multiple items) (3,6–9).\n\nThe growing body of evidence shows that experiences of COVID-19 pandemic–related food insecurity varied substantially across the US population. However, most epidemiologic studies cross-sectionally assessed food insecurity during a reference period (eg, the previous 12 months) and did not follow respondents over time to examine variability of experiences during that time. This is an important research gap, because most households with food insecurity tend to experience episodic rather than chronic food insecurity (10). Few studies have characterized the variability of food insecurity over time (11). Measurement of the timing of food insecurity in a more granular fashion has led to important public health and clinical outcomes, including increased use of emergency departments and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia at the end of the month versus earlier weeks of the month based on claims data (12).\n\nThe objective of our study was to characterize the heterogeneity in food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified trajectories through repeated measures data that assessed the probability food insecurity every 2 weeks in a nationally representative US sample. Characterizing the heterogeneity in food insecurity during this pivotal period is important to inform public health efforts to reduce food insecurity and its associated health harms, to monitor the impact of food insecurity–related policies, and to prioritize efforts designed for populations at greatest risk of persistent food insecurity.\n\nTop\n\nMethods\n\nData source and sampling\n\nWe used publicly available and deidentified data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel study of approximately 9,500 adult respondents conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California. Launched in 2014, UAS is an internet panel study that uses an address-based probability sampling strategy and provides internet-connected tablets to respondents to minimize the effects of the digital divide for online survey completion. Each survey of the UAS is approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review board. In March 2020, UAS launched the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, a longitudinal series of surveys that assessed economic and health-related indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered every 2 weeks from March 10, 2020, through March 30, 2021, then monthly through July 20, 2021.\n\nFor this study, we analyzed data from waves 2 through 25, or April 1, 2020, through March 30, 2021, because these waves occurred during the first year of the pandemic and had consistent measures of food insecurity. A total of 8,425 unique participants responded to at least 1 survey during the study period. We excluded participants from analysis if they did not complete more than 1 survey (n = 429) or did not provide at least 2 waves of responses to the food insecurity measures (n = 52), yielding a total sample of 7,944 unique respondents. On average, these respondents completed 21.3 (SD, 4.7) waves for a total of 148,392 surveys. Of these surveys, 98.6% (n = 146,265) had responses to food insecurity measures. Participants provided informed consent before completing their first survey either electronically or on paper. More information on the survey methodology and sampling can be found at https://uasdata.usc.edu.\n\nMeasures\n\nFood insecurity. Three survey items were adapted from the US Department of Agriculture’s US Household Food Security Survey (13), designed to assess food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Understanding Coronavirus in America survey respondents were asked the following questions in reference to the past 7 days: 1) “Were you worried you would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?” 2) “Did you eat less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?” and 3) “Did you go without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?” Answer choices were yes, no, or unsure. For the 3 questions, unsure accounted for 2.6%, 2.1%, and 1.4% of responses, respectively. Given prior research on social desirability bias when assessing food insecurity (14) and the small number of unsure responses, we considered yes and unsure to be affirmative responses. In total, 8.9% of surveys were affirmative for item 1, 7.9% for item 2, and 4.2% for item 3. We coded food insecurity status (binary outcome) as affirmative (yes or unsure) to any of the 3 items.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics were age, binary sex, marital status, race (White or Caucasian [hereinafter White], Black or African American, Native American/American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), educational attainment, annual household income, employment status, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, household composition (no children in household vs children in household), and US Census Bureau–designated geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). Sociodemographic factors are based on responses to participants’ first survey, collected from April 1, 2020, through March 2, 2021.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) (15) to identify clusters of people (ie, latent classes) based on variability in their binary response of any food insecurity over time. LCGA is a longitudinal clustering technique that uses latent (unobserved) variables (16,17) and has similarities to other trajectory modeling techniques, including latent growth mixture modeling, but LCGA does not allow for within-class variation in trajectories (18). Classes identified by LCGA are not known a priori and are determined empirically, but because a substantial proportion of survey participants were observed to have no change in food insecurity status over time, we assigned them to either a class that remained food secure or a class that remained insecure throughout the study period (n = 5,317) (19).\n\nWe estimated a trajectory shape for each class, and participants (n = 2,627) were assigned to latent classes according to their posterior probabilities (20). The 1-class solution was first specified, which was then used as a comparison for solutions of increasing class size until the best solution was identified. To identify the optimal number of classes, we evaluated statistical indices and tests and parameter estimates, including likelihood ratio tests, such as the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin test and Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted test, entropy, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample-size adjusted BIC, corrected AIC for small sample sizes, and assessment of class cell sizes (16) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). We created a graph in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) of the average probability of endorsing food insecurity at each time within each cluster.\n\nThe food insecurity outcome was binary and represented any affirmative indication of food insecurity. We therefore relied on a commonly used approach for a latent variable model for a binary outcome, which was to assume that a normally distributed latent variable (food insecurity*) exists, from which participants respond affirmatively when the latent variable exceeds some threshold (16). That is, in these models, for individual i across time points\n\nFood Insecurityi = Yes if τ < Food Insecurityi*\n\nwhere τ is the threshold parameter.\n\nThe interpretation of the model coefficients in our LCGA followed from probit analyses. That is, within each cluster, the model coefficient for the linear slope is the change in the z score of a normal distribution for a 1-unit change in time. We assumed linear growth in food insecurity after evaluating descriptive plots and generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal data in the entire sample. We used the MLR option in Mplus to estimate the model (21), which uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters but uses a robust sandwich-type estimator (Huber–White sandwich estimator) to calculate SEs (22). Robust approaches are resistant to errors under small violations of parametric assumptions. Our model also effectively handled ignorable missing data dependent on the data in hand (ie, following a missing-at-random assumption) via full information maximum likelihood. As a result, participants with missing data could still be included in the trajectory analysis for unbiased inference. In total, 80.0% of surveys were completed by all participants with responses to food insecurity questions. We examined sociodemographic factors across each trajectory for descriptive purposes in post hoc analyses.\n\nWe defined α = .05 for our level of significance in all statistical tests, which were 2-tailed. We conducted LCGA in Mplus version 8.6 (21). We used R program in the R studio environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for data management and graphic displays, and we used the MplusAutomation package to automate LCGA estimation and interpretation (23). Sample weights were not included in the LCGA but were used to calculate summary statistics and summarize sociodemographic characteristics, which were calculated by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nTop\n\nResults\n\nApproximately two-thirds (60.0%) of the sample at first survey were aged 18 to 50 years (Table 1). Just over half of the sample identified as female (53.9%), were married (53.4%), and were currently working (57.2%). The proportion of self-identified race and ethnicity in this sample generally mirrored the overall US population; for race, 75.9% identified as White only, 13.0% as Black only, and 5.6% as Asian only. For ethnicity, 19.1% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Approximately one-third had a bachelor’s degree or more (33.8%), earned more than $75,000 annually (34.4%), had children in the household (34.7%), and were living in the South (38.8%).\n\nFood insecurity trajectories\n\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, the prevalence of any food insecurity was as high as 20.4%. The prevalence decreased to 8.9% by March 2021, with most of the decline occurring in the early months, before leveling off in mid-2020 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of any food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Shading indicates 95% CIs. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nWe identified 10 unique trajectories of food insecurity (Figure 2), including the 2 trajectories that were empirically assigned (remained food secure and remained food insecure). Each trajectory can be described by the shape of its curve: 3 trajectories showed little change (remained insecure, remained elevated, and remained secure), 2 trajectories indicated a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a precipitous decline (named “initial shock 1” and “initial shock 2”), 3 trajectories with a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of decline (named “recovering 1,” “recovering 2,” and “recovering 3”), and 2 trajectories with a relatively low probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of incline (named “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2”).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nProbability of experiencing food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Three categories (remained secure, remained insecure, and remained elevated) were characterized as consistent. Two categories (initial shock 1 and initial shock 2) were characterized by a rapid decline in food insecurity status between March and July 2020. Three categories (recovering 1, recovering 2, and recovering 3) were defined as having experienced food insecurity initially, with the likelihood steadily declining during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories (became insecure 1 and became insecure 2) were defined as steadily becoming food insecure during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nAlthough most (64.7%) of the US-representative sample was in the “remained secure” category, 35.3% experienced some form of food insecurity (with 3.4% remaining insecure) during the first year of the pandemic (Table 2). Within that 35.3%, we found much variability. In addition to the 2 groups whose food security/insecurity status did not change, another group showed minimal changes: this group was mostly food secure during the study period but had an elevated prevalence of food insecurity, beginning at 13.6% in April 2020 and ending at 7.5% in March 2021. This group, “remained elevated,” comprised 11.6% of the study population.\n\nFive groups experienced some early form of food insecurity, but their probability of being food insecure declined over time. Two such trajectories, initial shock 1 (4.6% of the study population) and initial shock 2 (3.2% of the study population), appear to have briefly experienced food insecurity. This experience may have been largely related to the initial economic shutdowns in the earliest months of the pandemic in 2020, wherein states and municipalities issued stay-at-home or lockdown orders to mitigate the spread of the virus. These 2 trajectories are distinguished by the length of time needed for food insecurity to be resolved. Participants classified as initial shock 1 took about 16 weeks to resolve, while initial shock 2 was resolved within 8 weeks.\n\nThree groups took longer to recover from food insecurity experienced earlier in the pandemic: “recovering 1” (4.3%) ended the first year at a slightly elevated probability of food insecurity, while “recovering 2” (2.6%) and “recovering 3” (1.1%) had a similar rate or slope of recovery but a different initial probability of food insecurity.\n\nThe probability of becoming food insecure increased during the first year of the pandemic for 2 groups. These 2 trajectories, “became insecure 1” (3.1%) and “became insecure 2” (1.5%), had nearly the same rate or slope of becoming food insecure but their initial probability of food insecurity differed.\n\nAlthough small sample sizes and corresponding wide 95% CIs in some groups precluded a statistical comparison of sociodemographic characteristics across trajectories, characteristics appeared to differ in several ways (Supplemental Table 2A and 2B in Appendix). Those who remained food secure, compared with those in other trajectories, tended to be older, self-identified as White, and had a greater income at first interview.\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is among the first to describe population-level longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during a key time of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing heterogeneity in food insecurity experiences during this period. Notably, one-third of the population was found to experience any food insecurity when assessed longitudinally, whether food insecurity existed from the start and persisted (for approximately 15%), improved (for approximately 16%), or worsened (for approximately 5%). With careful attention to not overextend the findings of this initial study, we also observed that certain patterns of food insecurity corresponded with pivotal periods during the first year of the pandemic, starting with abrupt and widespread economic shutdowns in the earliest months. We found 2 patterns of food insecurity that occurred mainly in the earliest months of the pandemic before resolving relatively shortly thereafter (ie, initial shock 1 and initial shock 2). Therefore, an important consideration raised by our findings relates to the definition and measurement of food insecurity when accounting for the many factors that drive food insecurity.\n\nWhile food insecurity at the individual level occurs when access to adequate food is limited or uncertain because of a lack of money or other resources (13), the pillars of food security in a global context also include availability, use, and stability (24). The pandemic introduced a host of other factors described elsewhere (ie, business and school closures, supply chain issues, and stockpiling of groceries and resulting shortages) (6,25) that affected experiences of food insecurity for reasons beyond a person’s lack of access caused by money. Our findings, particularly data on the initial shock 1 and initial shock 2 groups, may speak to food insecurity experiences that were driven more by societal disruptions than by economic or financial uncertainty at the individual level. For instance, while worrying about running out of food before being able to buy more is a key screening question for food insecurity (14), affirmative responses to this question could have also been driven by factors that go beyond having enough money for food. That respondents in the initial shock 2 group appeared to share similar sociodemographic characteristics with respondents in the group that remained food secure raises new considerations in defining and measuring food insecurity in the context of a novel global pandemic.\n\nSeveral patterns of food insecurity described here, such as the one for people who remained food insecure during the entire study period, are particularly concerning. Because nearly half of those in the remained insecure group were SNAP recipients at the outset of the study period, this group may represent a small but important population for whom existing food insecurity protection policies were already not sufficient or whose food insecurity was not being adequately addressed before the pandemic. Groups that showed increases in the probability of food insecurity over time also warrant attention; 2 groups, “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2,” were worse off 1 year after the onset of the pandemic than at the beginning. Although small sample sizes preclude us from making reliable sociodemographic comparisons, findings suggest that the initial probability of food insecurity distinguished the trajectories of these 2 groups.\n\nSeveral lessons can be learned from populations that experienced food insecurity early in the pandemic but either recovered entirely or were headed toward recovery 1 year later. In studies of food insecurity after other large-scale and highly disruptive events, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana (26) and Hurricane Harvey in Texas (27), findings highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics as protective factors (ie, income, partner status) and risk factors (ie, low levels of social support, poor physical or mental health, female sex/gender) for remaining food insecure in the year(s) after the events. Notably absent in the literature is substantive longitudinal research on the impact of recovery policies. Given the wide berth of policies implemented in the US in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial opportunity exists to explore how these policies, such as those directly aimed at reducing food insecurity or unemployment, may have contributed to each trajectory to identify what aspects of each policy either contributed to recovery or inhibited it.\n\nA wealth of research demonstrates the relationship among income, employment status, and food insecurity. However, the confluence of various local, state, and federal responses to the pandemic provides a unique microcosm for examining a more direct impact on food insecurity. One multisite analysis found that food insecurity was highest during the pandemic among those who experienced job disruptions (28). The initial expiration of unemployment insurance at the federal level at the end of July 2020, along with the general uncertainty about its extension or even the future COVID-19 landscape, likely played a role in the upward trend in overall food insecurity observed around August 2020 (29,30). Further work in this area may entail examining how the economic impact of business closures and unemployment insurance claims (31) may have affected trajectories of food insecurity. For instance, researchers could examine the association of food insecurity trajectories with the comparative efficiency with which states implemented unemployment policies. Furthermore, research using other data sources would be necessary to examine the influence of policies such as the expanded child tax credit.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Measures of food insecurity were examined only during the first year of the pandemic and did not account for food insecurity experienced before the pandemic nor their trajectory as the pandemic extended beyond March 2021. This study also assumed that all LCGA model assumptions were met in this sample for valid inference (ie, within-class multivariate normality) (32). We did perform more robust inference in case model parametric assumptions that were violated. Another limitation is that in our chosen 10-class solution, some classes had small cell sizes, and the entropy values and some of the averages of posterior probability of membership were low (2 clusters had an average posterior probability of membership below the threshold of 0.70 considered as a general guideline for adequate assignment accuracy) (33). Thus, we chose as our selection criteria global model fit and thorough interpretability of the possible clustering in this data (ie, more clusters, each unique in characteristic) over a more precise solution involving fewer classes. The small sample sizes in some classes preclude formal comparisons of sociodemographic differences across classes, although we note that those who remained food secure tended to belong to historically advantaged sociodemographic groups, whereas racial and ethnic minority populations were more likely to experience other trajectories of food insecurity (34). Across the 10 classes that were identified here, the group least vulnerable to food insecurity — remained secure — had the highest proportion of respondents who self-identified as White, earned an annual income exceeding $75,000 per year, and had completed a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlighted population-level heterogeneity in the experience of food insecurity in the US throughout the first year of the pandemic, particularly in demonstrating the large variability of population response to the pandemic in food insecurity experiences. These initial findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and food-insecurity–related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic, with particular attention to those whose risk remained high, remained elevated, or increased over time. The findings here also provide an opportunity and suggest a need for public health researchers to take a more granular look at how policies may have affected food insecurity during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe project described in this article relies on data from survey(s) administered by the UAS, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California (USC).

That's 3.5 million more than the prior year. Families with children and people of color experienced higher than average rates of food insecurity."", 'Full_text': 'Just putting three meals a day on the table was a struggle for millions of people in the U.S. last year. That\'s the sobering conclusion of a new report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which found hunger in the U.S. rose sharply in 2022.\n\nThe report found that 44.2 million people lived in households that had difficulty getting enough food to feed everyone in 2022, up from 33.8 million people the year prior. Those families include more than 13 million children experiencing food insecurity, a jump of nearly 45 percent from 2021.\n\n""These numbers are more than statistics. They paint a picture of just how many Americans faced the heartbreaking challenge last year of struggling to meet a basic need for themselves and their children,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a statement.\n\nThe findings reverse a decade-long decline in hunger and food insecurity in the U.S. And they reflect the loss of several pandemic-era measures designed to strengthen the social safety net, says Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies food insecurity and federal nutrition programs.\n\n""A lot of the programs that had buffered people\'s experience during the pandemic were retired or rolled back in some way,"" Waxman says.\n\nThose programs included an expanded child tax credit that gave families with children extra money, temporarily increased benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP – formerly known as food stamps – and free school meals for every child.\n\nAt the same time, food prices and housing costs have shot up, says Kelly Horton, chief program officer at the Food Research and Action Center. And she points out an increasing number of Americans are working in unstable gig-economy jobs, like delivering groceries, driving for ride-share services or completing tasks on demand.\n\n"" So all of these things converging...we have a lot of people who are living on the edge,"" Horton says.\n\nIn its report, the USDA found that nearly 7 million households were so financially squeezed last year that they had to skip meals at times because there wasn\'t enough food to go around. Almost all of these households said they couldn\'t afford to eat balanced meals. In some 381,000 households with children, kids also experienced the pangs of hunger – skipping meals or going the whole day without eating. Waxman notes this could have significant health consequences, especially for kids.\n\n""In particular, we worry about that for children because their trajectory now influences what happens to them later,"" says Waxman. She notes research has found children who experience food insecurity are more likely to experience worse health outcomes down the road, including cognitive or developmental delays and higher rates of hospitalization.\n\nOverall, households with children and those of color experienced food insecurity at significantly higher rates than the national average. The rates of hunger for Black and Latino households were both more than double the rates for white households.\n\nFood access advocates say the findings underscore the importance of protecting social safety-net programs. Right now, there\'s particular concern when it comes to the fate of the food assistance program known as WIC, which serves pregnant mothers and young children up to age 5.\n\nSince the pandemic-era increases to SNAP benefits ended, more families have been turning to WIC for help with food, says Nell Menefee-Libey, public policy manager at the National WIC Association.\n\n""We know that more families are turning to the program and find themselves needing support from WIC who may previously have not been using WIC services,"" Menefee-Libey says.\n\nBut some lawmakers have proposed funding cuts to WIC benefits, even as the program needs additional funding to serve the increased number of families that are seeking assistance, says Horton of FRAC.\n\n""So there could be a case where WIC runs out of money if Congress does not give them additional funds,"" Horton says.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-04-13/deaths-from-malnutrition-have-more-than-doubled-in-the-u-s', 'Headline': 'U.S. Malnutrition Deaths Have More Than Doubled - U.S. News & World Report', 'Snippet': 'The same trend occurred nationwide, with malnutrition deaths more than doubling, from about 9,300 deaths in 2018 to roughly 20,500 in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ...', 'Full_text': ""By Phillip Reese | KFF Health News\n\nA growing number of California’s oldest residents are dying of malnutrition, a yearslong trend that accelerated during the COVID pandemic.\n\nDeaths attributed to malnutrition more than doubled, from about 650 in 2018 to roughly 1,400 in 2022, according to preliminary death certificate data from the California Department of Public Health. The same trend occurred nationwide, with malnutrition deaths more than doubling, from about 9,300 deaths in 2018 to roughly 20,500 in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMalnutrition is particularly common among older people, especially those who are ill, low-income, homebound, or without reliable access to healthy food or medical services. It can result from not eating enough but also from poor eating habits that lead to nutritional deficiencies. The majority of deaths in California from malnutrition last year occurred in residents 85 and older.\n\nSeveral experts said COVID lockdowns likely cut off access to healthy food. Because the oldest people were the most likely to die from COVID, officials encouraged them to limit their exposure to others who might have the disease.\n\n“People who may have been reliant on public transportation or reliant on others to get to the grocery store — suddenly they're nervous to take the bus,” said Lindsay Clarke, senior vice president of health education and advocacy at the Alliance for Aging Research, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C. “That family member or friend who would have come to pick them up and take them to the grocery store is worried about having them in their car.”\n\nPandemic lockdowns also hindered safety net programs that feed seniors. For example, many adult day care centers closed, eliminating places for seniors to go during the day as an alternative to nursing care. Dr. Louise Aronson, a geriatrician and professor at the University of California-San Francisco, said seniors who used the programs “may rely on the food they get there as their best meal of the day.”\n\nMalnutrition deaths rose in 2022 even as lockdowns faded. Experts said the persistence of the trend could be due to some of the oldest residents continuing to isolate.\n\nCOVID remains a serious danger for that demographic. About 5,400 Californians 85 and older died from COVID last year, making it the fifth-leading cause of death for that age group — responsible for more than twice as many deaths as diabetes, preliminary state data shows.\n\n“For a lot of people who are older adults and people with disabilities, it's not really over,” said Trinh Phan, who works from California for the nonprofit Justice in Aging. Phan said many older Californians are afraid of COVID, asking themselves, “Do I actually want to risk that for myself given my own risk factors?”\n\nSEE:\n\nTop 10 Causes of Death in America\n\nWhile the number of California malnutrition deaths jumped during the pandemic, it had been increasing for years. Some of that increase may be due to the overall aging of the population, experts said.\n\nAbout 678,000 Californians are 85 or older, a number that increased by roughly 59% from 2000 to 2021, census data show.\n\nCalifornians 85 or older accounted for almost three in five malnutrition deaths in the state last year. Those 95 or older make up almost one in five malnutrition deaths, even though only about one in 700 Californians fall within that age group.\n\n“Biologically we do eat less as we grow older,” Aronson said. “You're just literally less hungry.”\n\nIn addition, particularly old people have slower metabolism and digestion than younger people. “When you're eating less food overall, it's hard to get all the nutrients you need,” she said.\n\nMore factors beyond pandemic lockdowns and an aging population may be causing the steep rise in reported malnutrition among older people. The rate of malnutrition deaths per 100,000 residents in California among those 85 or older rose precipitously around 2013, jumping fivefold by 2019 and from there doubling during the pandemic.\n\nComplicating the picture is how often malnutrition appears in conjunction with other illnesses. Older adults are more vulnerable to diseases — such as heart failure, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and depression — that can reduce their appetites and lead to malnutrition as a secondary cause of death.\n\nMalnutrition was a contributing cause in 5,600 deaths in California on top of the 1,400 deaths for which it was the primary, underlying cause, provisional CDC data show. The number of deaths for which malnutrition was a secondary cause of death rose by about 1,700, or 43%, from 2018 through 2022.\n\n“You might be admitted with diabetes but at the same time you're also malnourished, and so the malnourishment adds to your problems,” said Paul Brown, a professor at the University of California-Merced who has co-presented papers on malnutrition in California at an American Public Health Association conference.\n\nREAD:\n\nDrug Deaths Up Among Older Americans\n\nThere is also an increased push to recognize malnutrition. Two of the nation's leading nutrition science organizations released updated guidelines in 2012 to better standardize diagnosis.\n\nThe highest malnutrition death rates among older Californians from 2020 through 2022 were in rural or semirural counties: Lake, Merced, Butte, Tuolumne, and Sutter.\n\nBrown said older residents living in rural counties often live in “food deserts,” which are areas that lack access to healthy food.\n\nAmong large, urban counties, Sacramento had the highest rate of malnutrition deaths among those 65 or older from 2020 through 2022. County spokesperson Macy Obernuefemann said the public health agency helps control and manage chronic diseases often accompanied by malnutrition and that several programs help seniors get the food they need.\n\nSeveral programs in California seek to lower malnutrition among older people. The state’s network of 33 Area Agencies on Aging often offer healthy meals to older adults, according to Sara Eisenberg, a spokesperson for the California Department of Aging. Organizations such as Meals on Wheels do so as well. The agencies also regularly try to make sure seniors are enrolled in CalFresh, the state’s food assistance program for eligible low-income residents, Eisenberg said.\n\nCalFresh benefits increased in late 2021 by 27%, helping many seniors afford food. A bill in the legislature, SB 600, would increase the minimum CalFresh benefits from $23 a month to $50. There’s also a push to expand CalFresh benefits to more undocumented immigrants, many of whom face food insecurity.\n\n“I think that there has been really positive movement,” Phan said.\n\nHowever, enhanced CalFresh benefits that gave millions of people more money during the pandemic expired in late March.\n\nPopulation trends suggest malnutrition will continue to be a problem. The number of Californians 85 and older, the group most prone to malnutrition, is projected to grow by about 420,000, or 54%, from 2020 to 2030, according to state Department of Finance projections.\n\nPhillip Reese is a data reporting specialist and an assistant professor of journalism at California State University-Sacramento.

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'A study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

On the other side of the table, the obesity crisis also weighs heavily. Malnutrition is less about food than about socioeconomic factors such as conflict, poverty, and global disasters such as climate change and the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nutrition and infectious disease exist in an intricate dance. Adequate and balanced nutrition is critical for appropriate response to infection and any changes in the balance can serve as a tipping point for the next pandemic. On the other hand, pandemics, such as COVID-19, lead to greater malnutrition. Both over- and undernutrition increase severity of disease, alter vaccine effectiveness, and potentially create conditions for viral mutation and adaptation—further driving the disease and famine vicious cycle. These long-term health and socioeconomic repercussions have direct effects at individual and global levels and lead to long-term consequences. Therefore, investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, and nutrition programs become vital at a much more complex systems level.\n\nCitation: Hyder S, Chhem RK, Claes F, Karlsson EA (2022) Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19.

Around 536 AD, a volcano erupted—possibly in Iceland—spilling millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere across the Northern Hemisphere [1]. The sun disappeared for 18 months. Crops failed. Millions starved. It also likely sparked the Plague of Justinian (the first documented bubonic or “Black” plague), leading to more famine and devastation. It happened again in the 1300s. A volcanic eruption somewhere in New Zealand led to years of cool, rainy weather preventing crops from ripening in Europe [2]. Waves of respiratory diseases further weakened the population, leading to greater famine. This Great Famine possibly primed an undernourished, weakened population for the Black Death to ravage through Europe in 1346, killing more than a third of the population [3]. In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, causing “the year without summer” and, as a long-term consequence, the Irish Potato Famine of 1845, which led to mass starvation and many death from communicable diseases [4].\n\nAre we detecting commonality here? The historical and biological Butterfly Effect of disease during a famine (or famine during outbreak) is an intricate dance. Infectious disease and malnutrition amplify bidirectionally. Catastrophes such as natural disasters, climate change, war, and economic collapse lead to starvation and infection. Weakened immune systems reduce resistance to further infection, and, ultimately, more malnutrition in a vicious cycle with long-lasting impacts on public health [5].\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic may not directly involve a volcano, history repeats itself. Disease leads to increased poverty, hunger, and changes in socioeconomic behaviors. Thus, insights from past pandemics frame the current COVID-19 hunger crisis and can inform actions to mitigate negative consequences from COVID-19 and future disease outbreaks. One of the most lasting legacies of the pandemic will be increased malnutrition—both undernutrition and obesity (Fig 1). These scars will echo with resounding implications, not only for pandemic recovery, but also for the future of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Several factors should be considered to reflect on the future of nutrition and infectious disease through the lens of COVID-19:\n\nHunger: What doesn’t kill you, just makes you more vulnerable to something else killing you\n\nEvery year, over 5.5 million children die before the age of 5, mostly in Africa and Asia [6]. Half of these children are undernourished. Why? Apart from the necessity of food for sustaining life, nutritional deficiencies decrease immune response, resulting in increased susceptibility, severity, and mortality from diseases. Indeed, about 32% of the global infectious disease burden could be alleviated by eliminating malnutrition [7]. Undernourished children are more susceptible to respiratory infections, diarrhea, measles, and malaria, to name a few [7]. Unfortunately, infection also leads to poor nutrition by causing anorexia and malabsorption and increasing nutrition requirements for immune cells. This leads to even more undernutrition, increasing susceptibility to disease, and moving further down the vicious cycle [8,9].\n\nThe weight of obesity in infectious disease\n\nMalnutrition isn’t just about not having enough food, it’s also about eating too much. Obesity impairs immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens including influenza and COVID-19 [10]. Why? Because your fat also talks to your immune system. Obesity alters adipose tissue signaling, resulting in miscommunication with the immune response and compromising function to deal with infections [11]. Therefore, this interrelationship between adipose tissue, immune response, and infections can exacerbate infection.\n\nYou are what your mother and mother’s mother ate\n\nThere is a direct linkage between maternal malnutrition and the nutritional status of her child. Early malnutrition significantly increases the risk of developing chronic diseases in adults, resulting in a weakened immune response to infectious diseases, and, beyond the age of 2 to 3 years, the effects of chronic malnutrition become almost irreversible [12,13]. Children of women who lived through the Hungry Winter of 1944 to 1945 in the Netherlands and the Chinese Great Famine of 1959 to 1961 faced higher rates of obesity, increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and increased rates of diabetes [12–14]. Even the grandchildren of these women were smaller than average and had a higher chance of becoming obese during adulthood [14]. But we shouldn’t point fingers at moms just yet. The nutritional environment both before conception and throughout gestation influences adult metabolism, but they are just one factor that involved in development.\n\nVaccination efficacy is like a bowl of porridge\n\nWhile opinions on vaccination are undoubtedly mixed, we cannot deny vaccines have greatly improved public health. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979. Polio, measles, and diphtheria are becoming rare. However, vaccine efficacy requires a functional immune system and nutrition is key to bolstering the immune response. Indeed, nutrition is a tipping point on the scales of immunity. Like Goldilocks, effective immunity requires everything to be just right. Too hot or too cold? Things start to break down. Undernutrition has been found to play a role in altering vaccine response for tuberculosis [15], rotavirus [16], measles, and pneumococcus [8]. Obesity also interferes with the ability to mount an effective immune response to vaccination. Obesity also reduces antibody response to hepatitis B and tetanus vaccination. While some associate this reduced response with improper needle length or vaccination technique, it’s also about the antibodies [17]. Compared with healthy-weight adults, vaccinated obese adults are at twice the risk of influenza-like illness or influenza despite equivalent serological response to the influenza vaccination [18].\n\nSometimes, viruses are what you eat\n\nNutritional excess or deficiency both dampen the host immune response and alter cellular metabolism, which creates an advantageous environment for viruses to explore the sequence space and potentially emerge with advantageous mutations [19]. Take obesity. The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports a more diverse viral quasispecies—a mutant cloud of genomes that collectively infect, replicate, and spread among hosts—potentially evolving pathogenic variants capable of inducing greater transmission or disease severity [20]. On the flip side, nutritional deficiencies also change the genetic composition of viruses. In selenium-deficient and vitamin E-deficient mice, genetic mutations arise in coxsackie B and influenza virus populations, and benign strains become more virulent, even to well-nourished hosts [20].\n\nNutrition is critical for immune response and protection from infection. A significant proportion of people in the world are malnourished, a major concern for infectious disease. COVID-19 has increased malnutrition worldwide, creating conditions that may lead to the next pandemic. “People pack” by Dumitriu Robert, “Coronavirus pack” by Graphic Mall, “Coronavirus icon pack” by SkyClick, and “Coronavirus COVID-19 pack” by Eucalyp Studio are all available at http://www.iconfinder.com under a Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). “Phosphor Thin Vol.4 pack” by Phosphor Icons is available at https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/phosphor-thin-vol-4 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010810.g001\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Nutrition and infection in the “New Normal”\n\nBefore the pandemic, the world was already malnourished. Only 2 out of every 5 people on the planet were considered healthy, and many of those probably had a vitamin deficiency [6]. Despite decades of effort, 820 million people in the world still faced hunger shortages and chronic malnutrition at the end of 2019 [21]. Economic slowdowns and downturns already undermined food security [22]. Then along came a pandemic. Lockdowns, supply chain issues, mass job losses, and political crises exacerbated major socioeconomic challenges and furthered food scarcity and inaccessibility. In all, it is estimated that COVID-19 has threatened access to a healthy diet for nearly 2 billion people [21], 6.7 million of those being children under the age of 5 [23].\n\nAlong with hunger, global obesity had nearly tripled since 1975, with almost 40% of adults being overweight in 2016 [24]. During the pandemic, as some were edging closer to wasting and stunting, others were ballooning further into obesity. Pandemic stress, job loss, decreased access to nutritious foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have exacerbated the obesity epidemic [25]. For children in the United States, rate of body mass index increase nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic [26]. As COVID-19 continues to aggravate malnutrition globally, it feeds the vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection with potentially even greater morbidity and mortality down the road. Furthermore, prophylactics for nutritionally compromised populations continue to remain uncharted territory, as a majority of vaccine seroconversion and effectiveness studies are performed on healthy individuals, a minority of the current global population [11].\n\nSo, even before the pandemic ends, we already need to start considering the next. The majority of critically malnourished people reside in global hotspots of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Pathogens will continue spilling over. The vicious cycle will continue. Investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, equal access to healthy food, and good nutritional programs is vital. Even combating climate change is critical for agriculture, disease exposure, and, yes, volcanoes. About 1,500 potentially active volcanoes exist around the world. As our planet warms, these volcanoes are projected to become more active and the cooling effects of their eruptions are expected to increase by 15%, massively increasing repercussions. No one wants another worst year to be alive.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank everyone involved in critical discussions and review of this manuscript in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, including Dr. Veasna Duong, and Dr. Jurre Siegers.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party.

Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers. And if the case is eventually dismissed, it will be cited as a sign the establishment is still out to get him.\n\nMr Trump\'s legal complaint alleges that ""in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Mrs Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation\'s democracy.\n\n""Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.""\n\nThe complaint cites court filings made by special counsel John Durham, a US government attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump\'s justice department in 2019 to investigate whether the government acted lawfully and appropriately when collecting intelligence ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

fuel the probe, US Special Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday.\n\nThe report marks the end of a four-year investigation launched in May 2019 when then-Attorney-General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage Crossfire Hurricane inquiry into potential contacts between Mr Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nMr Durham said there were a series of missteps by the FBI and Justice Department as investigators undertook a politically explosive probe in the heat of the 2016 election into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome.\n\nBut the report fell far short of the former president\'s prediction he would uncover the ""crime of the century"".\n\nThat Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump\'s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn his new 306-page report, Mr Durham concluded that US intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any ""actual evidence"" of collusion between Mr Trump\'s campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nHe also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Mr Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor instance, he said Ms Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Mr Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign.\n\n""Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigour towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.""\n\nIn response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time.\n\nThe report criticised the FBI for opening a full-fledged investigation based on ""raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence,"" saying the speed at which it did so was a departure from the norm.\n\nIt said investigators repeatedly relied on ""confirmation bias"", ignoring or rationalising away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.\n\nPolitical implications of report\n\nMr Durham\'s report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney-General Merrick Garland on Friday.\n\nMr Durham and his team cast a broad net, interviewing top officials at the FBI, Justice Department and CIA.\n\nIn his first year on the job, he travelled with Mr Barr to Italy to meet with government officials as Mr Trump himself asked then-Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other leaders to help with the probe.\n\nHis findings are likely to become political fodder for Mr Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Mr Trump\'s retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump had hoped Mr Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden\'s campaign.\n\nBut Mr Durham\'s investigation has largely failed to produce a meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022.\n\nIn one case Mr Durham brought, a Washington DC jury acquitted Hillary Clinton\'s former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Mr Trump\'s business and a Russian bank.\n\nMr Durham\'s investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI when he was interviewed about the sources of information he provided that became part of a document known as the Steele dossier.\n\nThat document, penned by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Mr Trump\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details — many of which were never substantiated.\n\nAn investigation by the Justice Department\'s inspector general later found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier when it applied for court-approved warrant applications to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nMr Durham did secure a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who was singled out in the inspector general\'s report, for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Mr Page.\n\nMr Durham\'s report echoed many of the concerns the inspector general previously raised about the rigour of the FBI\'s process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\n\nThe FBI has since implemented numerous reforms to the process.'}}",90.83333333333333,1

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. On November 19, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until after Trump\'s second presidency; Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling, which cannot take place until after sentencing.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][524] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[525][526][527]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[527] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[525] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[527]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[528] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[529][530] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[531] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[532] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[533][534] On November 19, the Manhattan DA argued that the conviction should stand because no law states that temporary presidential immunity nullifies—post-trial—proceedings conducted during the president\'s time outside of office and regarding activities deemed unofficial to that post.[535]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[536][537] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[538] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[539] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[540]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[541] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][524] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[542] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[543] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[544] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[545] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[532][546]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[547] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[548][549] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[550] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[549]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19.[551] On that day, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until Trump leaves office.[535] The appeal cannot take place until after sentencing.[462]\n\nProhibitory consequences\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[552] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[553] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[554] [555] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[556] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[557][558]\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[559][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[560][564]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[565] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[565][566][567] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[565][568] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[569][565]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[570][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[571]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents.

Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day ...', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe former president was not giving evidence - instead, he stopped just outside the courtroom to address reporters before the historic hearing began.\n\nAfter a few stern looks at the camera, he launched into a lengthy preview of what his lawyers are expected to argue during the civil case again him, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization.\n\nHe also lobbed accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud charges and is seeking a fine of $250m (£207m), and Judge Arthur Engoron who already ruled last week that Mr Trump and his business had committed fraud.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at seven of Mr Trump\'s claims.\n\n1. There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/final-witness-delivers-blistering-testimony-against-trump-in-civil-fraud-case/', 'Headline': 'Final witness delivers blistering testimony against Trump in civil ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump, center, arrives at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, in New York.

He attacked the judge for the ruling last week. And he sought to tie them to special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictments, even though they are unconnected.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said before walking into the courtroom. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nAttorney general asks to ban Trump from doing business in New York: Kevin Wallace, with the attorney general’s office, alleged that Trump and his co-defendants conspired to commit persistent and repeated fraud and that Trump’s financial statements convinced banks to take on hidden risk “to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nThe opening statement underscored the risk the case poses to Trump and the Trump Organization, the former president’s business in New York, where Trump built up his name and image before he launched the political campaign that led him to the White House in 2016.\n\nTrump’s lawyers say this is how real estate works: With the former president looking on, Trump’s lawyers argued Monday that the attorney general’s case was flawed, saying that the differences in valuations were just part of the commercial real estate business.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Christopher Kise, argued there was no intent to defraud and “no victims” in the case.\n\nKise pointed to documents from Deutsche Bank showing the bank valued Trump’s net worth $2 billion less than Trump did — but still underwrote the loan for Trump.\n\nJudge spars with Trump attorneys: The judge noted that the defense team already had tried to dismiss the case by claiming James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump. He had already denied the motion, Engoron said, and his ruling had been affirmed by a New York appellate court.\n\nThe judge also sparred with Trump attorney Alina Habba over a discussion about an accounting disclaimer for Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm. The disclaimer essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nThe exchanges underscored how the upcoming trial is going to be contested — especially when the judge, and not a jury, will decide the outcome.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nFact check: Trump’s inaccurate comments about a ""worthless clause""\n\nIn comments to reporters before the Monday hearing, Trump spoke at length about what he called a “worthless clause” disclaimer in the financial statements that are at issue in the trial.\n\nTrump said, “We have a clause in the contract, it’s like a buyer beware clause. It says, ‘When you take a look at the financial statement, don’t believe anything you read’ — this is up front. ‘Don’t believe anything you read.’ Some people call it a ‘worthless clause,’ because it makes the statement, and anything you read in the statement, worthless. It says, ‘Go out and do your own research, go out and do your own due diligence, you have to study the statement carefully. Do not believe anything.’”\n\nHe said moments later that the clause “immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation.”\n\nFacts First: Trump inaccurately described this clause, as Judge Arthur Engoron noted in a ruling last week in which he found Trump liable for fraud. The clause does not say “don’t believe anything you read,” its actual language is significantly softer than Trump claimed. And there is no apparent basis for Trump’s suggestion that the clause inoculates him against any litigation at all.\n\nEngoron wrote last week that “the ‘worthless clause’ does not say what defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud as to facts peculiarly within defendants’ knowledge, even vis-à-vis sophisticated recipients.”\n\nHe also wrote that “a defendant may not rely on a disclaimer for misrepresentation of facts peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge” — and that “defendants’ reliance on these ‘worthless’ disclaimers is worthless.”\n\nHere’s the text of the clause:\n\nThere is certainly language in the clause that suggests that readers of the financial statements should use caution in relying on the listed asset valuations. But the clause doesn’t say the valuations are entirely worthless and does not tell readers that they should simply not believe anything they read in the statements. Rather, it suggests there had been a good-faith effort to value the assets using a variety of reasonable methods.\n\n“You can read it up and down; it doesn’t say, ‘I will lie to you, I will double or triple the value of these things — my statements in here are outright lies,’” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said last week.\n\nJudge asks whether testimony about 2011 documents was a ""waste of time""\n\nThe judge in former President Donald Trump’s civil trial Monday questioned whether lengthy witness testimony about 2011 financial documents was a “waste of time” because of statute of limitations applying to the case expired in 2014.\n\nAt the end of Monday’s court session, Judge Arthur Engoron responded to testimony from former Mazars account Donald Bender about the 2011 financial documents, acknowledging that a state appellate court had ruled the statute of limitations only allowed allegations from 2014 onward to apply in the case.\n\nThe defense agreed with Engoron’s assertion, prompting Trump to give a thumbs up.\n\nThe judge’s comment marked a small win for Trump because it showed the judge again recognizing the statute of limitations that had been decided by the appeals court.\n\nAt the same time, however, Engoron did allow the witness testimony about the 2011 financial documents on Monday over the objection of Trump’s attorneys, as the attorney general’s office indicated it would connect the testimony to allegations that fall within the statute of limitations.\n\nBender is returning for a second day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nIn his ruling last week, Engoron wrote that the fraudulent statements of financial condition were still relevant in the case even if they’re for transactions completed before 2014 because they were submitted within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge wrote that the attorney general’s office was not “challenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,” but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information.\n\nMonday’s comments addressing admissible evidence do not indicate that Engoron will change that ruling.\n\nTrump\'s motorcade returns to Trump Tower after he attended first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has returned to Trump Tower after spending the day attending his civil fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until December 22, according to Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nAsked if he would return to court on Tuesday, Trump told reporters while leaving court for the day: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nCivil fraud trial “took me off the campaign trail,"" Trump claims\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that Monday’s civil fraud trial in New York took him “off the campaign trail” and cast the trial as a political attack against him.\n\nTrump was not required to attend the trial, which is a civil action — not a criminal case.\n\nDespite that the former president attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James’ $250 million lawsuit against him in the same manner that he has railed against the criminal charges he’s facing in four other jurisdictions.\n\nAsked whether he was returning for the trial on Tuesday, Trump said: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nFact check: Trump baselessly claims federal Justice Department is behind New York civil fraud trial\n\nIn comments to reporters before Monday’s hearing, former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that the federal Justice Department orchestrated the New York state civil fraud case and other cases against him.\n\n“It all comes down from the DOJ. They totally coordinate this in Washington,” Trump said. He added later in his remarks, “It’s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington. Everything goes through them.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Justice Department directed anyone to bring this state civil fraud case. The trial that began Monday stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who quickly began investigating Trump’s company upon being sworn in at the beginning of 2019 – when Trump still had two full years left in his presidency. Trump has correctly noted that James, a Democrat, herself ran on a campaign platform that included a vow to take on Trump.\n\nTrump also said in his Monday comments that “this trial could’ve been brought years ago, but they waited ‘til I was right in the middle of my campaign; the same with other trials and indictments.”\n\nIt’s true that a previous New York attorney general could conceivably have pursued the same case years ago, since the allegations pertain to conduct dating back more than a decade — but James brought the case in September 2022, roughly two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022.\n\nTrump faces two federal criminal cases that were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland; it’s fair to argue that the Justice Department is behind those cases.\n\nBut Trump has also baselessly alleged that the Justice Department is responsible for two criminal cases brought against him by local district attorneys in Manhattan, New York, and Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump says he attended the civil trial because he wanted ""to watch this witch hunt"" himself\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he attended the civil fraud trial against him that began Monday in New York so he could “watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\nTrump was not required to appear in court Monday for the trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives. But he chose to attend and sit in the Manhattan courtroom – while giving multiple statements attacking the proceedings as he entered and exited.\n\nHe continued to rail against Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil trial, saying he should be disbarred after he ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case.\n\nTrump criticizes judge overseeing civil fraud case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attacked Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil case, as he left the courtroom during a lunch break following opening statements this morning.\n\nTrump called Engoron a Democrat and “an operative,” saying that the case against him was a “disgrace.” He also attacked the New York Attorney General Letitia James for going after him instead of violent crime.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said.\n\n“They waste their time with this, with banks that were very happy that got all their money back. They weren’t defrauded. I’ve been defrauded,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he was coming back to the courtroom after lunch, Trump said, “probably.”\n\nEngoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case, one of the seven claims that are a part of the lawsuit.\n\nWatching Trump\'s body language in court\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not expressed much emotion in the courtroom for the first session of the criminal fraud trial.\n\nDuring the four opening statements, Trump sat at the defense table between two of his lawyers. He never spoke to the judge. Trump often faced forward, watching the small video monitor in front of him which displayed the opening presentations by the state and his defense lawyer.\n\nWhen Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, who are lawyers for Trump’s co-defendants, spoke without video presentations, Trump looked at them intently. Habba, who represents Allen Weiselberg, Jeff McConney and other employees of the Trump Organization, at times turned to Trump when she was discussing the valuation of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, answered questions from the judge, Trump wrote notes and passed them to him. Eric Trump, who is also a defendant, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery, on the defense side behind and to his father’s left. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sat in the front row on the other side of the courtroom, behind the former president and about 15 feet to his right.\n\nTrump only once looked at James, as he left the courtroom for the lunch break, turning his head as he walked past where she was seated. Eric Trump stopped and shook her hands using both of his hands as he followed his father out of the courtroom.\n\nFact check: The Trump campaign leaves out this year\'s crime declines while attacking Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign deployed out-of-date crime data about New York City in a Monday attack on state Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the lawsuit in which the former president is now facing a civil fraud trial for inflating asset valuations on financial statements.\n\nIn a news release the campaign distributed shortly before Trump appeared in a New York courtroom for the start of the trial, the former president’s campaign delivered a variety of attacks against James — one of them pointing out that she received a campaign donation from liberal billionaire George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist and Democratic donor who has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories baselessly depicting him as a puppet master behind various domestic and international events.\n\nThe Trump campaign concluded the Monday release by claiming that New York crime has “skyrocketed” under James, who took office in 2019. But the campaign repeatedly used crime data from 2021 or 2022 even though more recent data is available — making the crime picture look worse than it is, since the situation with some major crime categories has improved markedly this year and last.\n\nFor example, the Trump campaign said, “In New York City, shootings increased by 71% from 2018 to 2022.”\n\nWhile that’s accurate, the campaign didn’t mention that the number of shootings in the city has plummeted by about 27% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022 — after also falling about 17% for the full year of 2022 compared to the full year of 2021.\n\nIn other words, the Trump campaign didn’t explain that New York City is now well into a second straight year with an improving shootings trendline, and, if current trends roughly hold for the rest of the year, that 2023 will end with a much less than 71% increase over the number of shootings compared to 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the Trump campaign said, “Murders increased by 48% from 2018 to 2022 in New York City.” The Trump campaign didn’t mention that the number of murders in the city declined by about 10% in 2022 and has fallen by about 11% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022. Again, the trendline is well into a second year of significant improvement.\n\nAnd the numbers aside, it’s also highly questionable at best to blame or credit an individual attorney general for the crime situation in their state.\n\nThe number of murders spiked around the country beginning in 2020, when there was widespread economic and social upheaval because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has improved around the country in 2022 and 2023 — complicating attempts to assign blame for the increases or credit for the decreases to any particular state or local official.\n\nIn addition, the precise causes of crime fluctuations are difficult to pinpoint even decades after the fact; they are affected by numerous factors, from the economy to government policy to sociocultural factors to policing strategies to the corrections system.\n\nTrump posts clips of New York attorney general talking about suing the former president\n\nVideos of New York Attorney General Letitia James talking about suing Donald Trump were being posted on the former president’s social media account while he sat inside a Manhattan courtroom for the civil fraud trial that James brought against him.\n\nTrump is arguing that the case, which began Monday, is politically motivated.\n\nIn one video, James can be heard saying, “Oh we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.”\n\nIn another clip, she says, “What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.”\n\nThe videos are posted on social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“New York embarrassment Letitia James is politically targeting President Trump,” the text in one video reads. “Letitia James is abusing her office.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyer: ""He has made a fortune literally about being right about real estate""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Chris Kise began his opening statement with an understatement, saying their team has a “very different picture of the evidence.”\n\nKise said the former president’s real estate knowledge made him a billionaire.\n\nTrump continues to look ahead at the monitor displaying his organization’s loan agreements, and occasionally leaning over talking to his lawyer.\n\n“There may be wide variations between different valuations” of certain parts of the Trump Org.’s real estate portfolio, Kise said, but added the evidence at trial will show the asset valuations on Trump’s statements of financial condition comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nIn pictures: Trump in court for civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at a New York City courthouse Monday for the start of a civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nLast week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a $250 million lawsuit last year alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nSee photos from inside and around the courthouse today:\n\nTrump claims civil fraud case is part of ""election interference"" against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed before walking into court Monday that the New York Attorney General’s civil case against him was part of an attempt to harm his campaign.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nTrump’s claims about election interference are the same attacks he’s made against all four of the criminal indictments against him.\n\nBefore entering the New York courtroom Monday, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Manhattan District Attorney General Alvin Bragg and the Justice Department, linking the civil action against him in New York with his criminal indictments, even though they are not related.\n\nTrump is surrounded by his attorneys in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is seated in a New York City courtroom flanked by his attorneys on each side of him.\n\nHis son Eric Trump is seated in the front row of the gallery on the defense side.\n\nThere are at least nine court officers in the room.\n\nTrump didn\'t look at Attorney General Letitia James as he entered the court\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seated in the front row of the courtroom, on the prosecution’s side and next to one of the aisles.\n\nAfter speaking with reporters in the hallway and calling James a “racist,” Trump entered the courtroom through the main doors about 15 feet to her right. The former president walked directly in front of her and did not appear to look in her direction.\n\nHe is sitting with his attorneys Christopher Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nTrump calls the civil fraud trial ""a scam"" and ""a sham""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Monday that the civil fraud trial against him and his associates that is set to begin soon is a “continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.”\n\nHe made the comments as he made his way to the courtroom where the trial will begin.\n\nTrump went on to attack Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “she was going to ‘get Trump’ before she even knew anything about me.”\n\n“She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor,” he said. “She had virtually no following. She came back and she said, ‘well, now I will go back to get Trump again.’ And this what we have. It is a scam and a sham.”\n\nTrump added that his financial statements “are phenomenal,” and claimed, “no bank was affected, no bank was hurt.”\n\nDonald Trump appears in courthouse hallway\n\nDonald Trump walked through the hallway in court ahead of his civil fraud trial. He is talking to reporters right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court gives one win to Trump today\n\nThere have been a smattering of attempts to remove Donald Trump from the ballot next year based on his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court said it won’t take up one of those longshot challenges, rejecting an appeal from John Anthony Castro, a little-known candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCastro’s case against Trump leans on a post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution is disqualified from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.\n\nThe case was denied without any comment or recorded vote.\n\nThere are still 14th Amendment challenges against Trump in Minnesota and Colorado, which are scheduled for trials later this year.\n\nEric Trump arrives at court\n\nDonald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has arrived at the New York City court ahead of the civil fraud trial against the former president, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nThe civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nNew York attorney general: ""No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law""\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in a short statement Monday morning, “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law.”\n\nThe attorney general noted that last week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The trial that begins today will determine the amount of damages owed.\n\nWatch the moment here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n980b6c7f-2a43-4e1c-8c67-e5eeeb5f987e.mp4\n\n00:44 - Source: CNN\n\nHere\'s what it\'s like inside the court where Trump\'s civil trial will play out\n\nThe civil fraud trial that former President Donald Trump will attend today is in the large third floor courtroom: room 300 of the 60 Centre Street building.\n\nPaintings on the wall depict the early courts of New York City, including the popular law courts of New Netherlands in the 1600s.\n\nThere are various computer display screens arranged for the parties, and two large screens for the court and the gallery.\n\nThere are nine rows of wood benches, with two aisles and some chairs on the side. Altogether, available seating exceeds 100 people.\n\nPeople are still arriving.\n\nDonald Trump and his adult children on witness lists in New York civil fraud case\n\nDonald Trump, his adult children, and his closest business advisors could be called to testify during the civil fraud trial expected to begin Monday in New York.\n\nTrump is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York Attorney General and Trump’s legal team. The state and Trump’s lawyers need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled last week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, defendants in the case and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in video depositions\n\nIn civil cases defendants can be called to testify and, if they refuse the jury, or in this case the judge, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial begins today. Here\'s what to know\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be in attendance Monday in a New York courtroom for the start of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nOpening statements in the civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a shocking ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nThe ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the $250 million lawsuit last September alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nTrump inflated his net worth by as much as $3.6 billion in three separate years between 2011 and 2021, according to the attorney general’s office. Attorneys for Trump have refuted the claims, arguing that asset valuations are highly subjective and that they are still sorting through what the ruling means for the company’s future.\n\nWhat’s at stake at trial: Trump and his companies could be forced to pay hefty sums in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through their fraudulent business practices.\n\nEngoron will consider just how much the Trumps and their businesses will have to pay.\n\nThe judge is expected to consider claims of business records fraud and insurance fraud alleged in the lawsuit in connection to high-profile properties, though he already determined some broad level of fraud was perpetuated.\n\nThe six causes of action are falsifying business records, conspiracy to falsify business records, issuing false financial statements, conspiracy to falsify false financial statements, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\n\nJames’ lawsuit also asks the court to consider banning the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nRead more about Trump’s fraud trial.\n\nTrump says he will attend his civil fraud trial in New York\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he will go to court in New York for his civil fraud trial on Monday.\n\nTrump had been expected to attend, and law enforcement and court employees had already been making security preparations for his potential appearance at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan on Monday and possibly Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s plans started to become clear after a federal judge in Florida granted his request to postpone a deposition in a separate case because it would conflict with the start of the New York trial.\n\nThe civil fraud case – brought in September 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives – will begin at 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nRemember: Last week, the judge overseeing the case dealt Trump a major blow in ruling that the former president is liable for fraud and that he overvalued his properties on his financial statements for a decade.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by James, who is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York, and a ban on the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nTrump fraud trial in New York will start today after appeals court ruling\n\nThe trial in the New York attorney general’s civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives, is set to begin Monday after a state appellate court denied Trump’s motion to stay the trial last week.\n\nThe trial comes in the wake of state Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron’s ruling Tuesday that Trump and his co-defendants are liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The judge will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities.\n\nThe judge has set aside nearly three months for the trial.\n\nJudge finds Trump and his sons liable for fraud ahead of civil trial\n\nA New York judge found Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud and canceled the Trump Organization’s business certification last week.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James — a case that is set to go to trial on Monday on the amount of damages owed.\n\nJames has alleged that Trump, three of his children, his companies and his business executives defrauded lenders, insurers and other entities. The state is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron’s ruling is a complete rejection of Trump’s arguments that he didn’t inflate the values of his golf courses, hotels, homes at Mar-a-Lago and Seven Springs on financial statements.\n\nAmong other things, Trump is accused of inflating the value of his triplex apartment at Trump Tower by three times its size, resulting in an overvaluation of between $114 million to $207 million, Engoron wrote.\n\nThe judge canceled the business certifications of the Trump entities that are defendants in the case, including the Trump Organization — a major blow to the business that has been so synonymous with the former president’s personal brand.\n\nA receiver will be put in place to “manage the dissolution” of the corporate entities. There are two New York properties that are part of the lawsuit, the commercial tower at 40 Wall Street and the Trump family compound at Seven Springs.\n\nQuestions remain as to how the receiver would dissolve the properties, if the ruling would impact properties located outside of New York state, including Mar-a-Lago, and if the Trumps could transfer the New York-based assets into a new company located out of state.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-civil-fraud-trial-11-06-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testifies in New York civil fraud trial | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump brought bombastic rhetoric to the witness stand Monday in the civil fraud case against him and his business, as he spent his time on the stand attacking the New York attorney general ...', 'Full_text': 'Key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand\n\nDonald Trump brought bombastic rhetoric to the witness stand Monday in the civil fraud case against him and his business, as he spent his time on the stand attacking the New York attorney general who brought the case and the judge overseeing the trial itself.\n\nTrump’s testimony at times mimicked his appearances on the campaign trail, where the former president has made the four criminal cases against him – along with the New York attorney general’s civil fraud case – a central part of his argument to be elected president again in 2024.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who has clashed with Trump throughout the trial, at first tried to stop the former president’s political barbs and speechifying, telling his lawyer Chris Kise to “control your client” and threatening to have Trump removed as a witness. Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/trump-civil-fraud-trial-witness-list-new-york/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump and his adult children are listed as potential witnesses ...', 'Snippet': 'The former president is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York attorney general and Trump’s legal team.

The proceedings are expected to resume again at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom with a team of aides and his lawyers, quickly passing reporters in the hallway again with no comment, but flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nJames also passed by reporters in the hallway but did not comment.\n\nTrump interrupts questioning to read from a document he pulled from his pocket\n\nMinutes ago, Trump pulled a paper out of his pocket, saying he wanted to read it. But the attorney general\'s lawyer pivoted to another question, and Trump rested the document to his right on the witness stand.\n\nTrump then interrupted the lawyer, saying he just wanted to read the document, and turned to the judge for an answer.\n\nEngoron told him no.\n\n“I am shocked,” Trump said.\n\nIt\'s unclear what the document is.\n\nTrump trains his ire on Engoron\n\nand\n\nLosing his composure, Trump then focused his ire on the judge, saying Engoron ruled against him before knowing anything about his company.\n\nTrump said the judge called him a ""fraud,"" raising his voice and pointing his right hand at the judge while looking straight ahead at the courtroom. He then said any fraud was on the part of the judge for his comments on the value of Trump\'s properties, not on Trump, calling it ""a terrible thing.""\n\nEngoron just looked forward, sour-faced.\n\n""Done?"" Wallace asked when Trump ended his outburst.\n\n“Done,” the former president said.\n\nTrump has essentially brought his rants inside the courtroom. Before, he would be well mannered during his appearances here; it was outside where he lost his cool. Now he\'s losing it on the witness stand.\n\nTrump defiantly asserts his wealth, calls James a \'hack\'\n\nand\n\nAs Trump was asked questions about additional properties, the former president said he is worth billions of dollars more than Attorney General Letitia James has said.\n\nPeople don\'t recognize the strength of the company he built because James\' office is trying to ""demean"" and ""hurt"" him, Trump claimed.\n\n“I think she is a political hack,” he said about the attorney general.\n\nHe repeated a common refrain of his online, calling the trial a political witch hunt and saying James should be ashamed of herself.\n\nWhile testifying in his New York civil fraud trial, Trump sparred with Engoron about his business dealings and claimed the trial was politically motivated. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard reports on what Trump said under oath so far.\n\nTrump appears restless during testimony\n\nand\n\nAs he testifies, Trump is leaning way back in his chair and has his arms crossed on his chest. He also appears a bit restless, slightly swaying his body back and forth.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, when Wallace would ask him to refer to pages of documents before him, Trump would only look at a screen provided in the courthouse, unlike a typical witness who would refer to the pages in his or her hands.\n\nTrump says he thought several valuations were \'too high\'\n\nand\n\nAs questioning continued about Trump\'s properties, the former president said he thought several valuations were ""too high,"" including of his Trump Tower triplex in 2014.\n\nAsked why the valuation was too high, Trump said a broker assessed the total area as 30,000 square feet, ""and I have access to the roof, and when you add the roof, you’re not that far off.” He said, ""I see how it was done,"" telling the court that ""they took 10,000 per floor"" and ""times three"" and didn’t take out the elevator shaft and other things.\n\nHe added, “There\'s a disclaimer clause, so if there is a mistake ... you don\'t get sued by the attorney general\'s office.”\n\nIn his earlier deposition, Trump referred to a disclaimer clause in the company\'s financial statements ""that says, don’t believe the statement, go out and do your own work. This statement is \'worthless.\' It means nothing.""\n\nBut in his late-September ruling ahead of the trial, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nEngoron cuts off Trump and prosecutor repeats questions\n\nand\n\nShortly after Trump resumed testimony, Engoron cut off the former president after Trump started to go on after answering a question about the value of an Avenue of the Americas property.\n\nAt another point, Trump veered into his focusing on China, Russia, and keeping the U.S. safe while president, the attorney general\'s lawyer said, “The question was actually about this property value.”\n\n""The question was"" and ""let me ask again"" are becoming familiar refrains as Trump doesn\'t answer the questions.\n\nTrump has returned to the courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump walked back into the courtroom at about 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\nHe turned to reporters in the hallway and gave a silent thumbs-up before following his lawyers through the courtroom doors.\n\nThe judge also entered the courtroom and everyone stood.\n\nWhen he resumed testimony, Trump began answering questions more succinctly.\n\nTrump leaves for a break without addressing reporters\n\nTrump exited the courtroom for a 15-minute break, walking quickly past reporters in the hallway.\n\nWhen asked, ""How\'s it going in there?"" Trump gestured as if zipping his lips and continued to walk away with his lawyers.\n\nBreak called; Trump leaves stand\n\nThe court is taking a break. Trump has left the witness stand.\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyers: \'I beseech you to control him\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe judge is again asking Trump\'s lawyers to have him answer questions directly while on the stand.\n\n""That was a simple yes-no answer,"" the judge said. ""I beseech you to control him.""\n\nThe judge went back and forth with Kise, with the judge saying, ""I don\'t want to hear everything he has to say.""\n\nHabba then told the judge that Wallace needs to ask better questions, saying, ""More succinct questions will give more succinct answers.""\n\n""We are not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron responded. ""We are here to have him answer questions.""\n\n""It\'s not that simple,"" Habba replied.\n\n""I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!"" Engoron then said, raising his voice.\n\nThe testy exchange prompted Trump to comment, ""This is a very unfair trial. I hope the public is watching.""\n\nThe judge\'s warnings are critical, as the case here is only meant to determine monetary damages. If Engoron determines that all of Trump\'s testimony is not credible, as he did the last time Trump took the stand, he may impose significant financial damages on Trump and his company.\n\nAttorney in hush money case audibly laughs\n\nand\n\nAs Trump continued to testify, one of his attorneys in the separate hush money case being brought by the Manhattan district attorney could be heard laughing in the second row of the courtroom as she observed and took notes.\n\nTrump says he thought Mar-a-Lago\'s value was underestimated\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhen asked about Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he thought its value was underestimated, but added that he didn\'t do anything about it.\n\nTrump referred to the attorney general\'s estimation that the Florida property was worth far less than he claimed (the AG’s office had noted the Palm Beach County assessor appraised its market value to be $18 million to $28 million from 2011 to 2021, while Trump’s balance sheet put its value at $426 million to $612 million).\n\nTrump claimed on the stand that the property was 50 to 100 times the state\'s estimation. He said he doesn\'t know how the lower estimation was arrived at, calling it ""absolutely crazy.""\n\nTrump says he thought his apartment was \'overvalued\'\n\nand\n\nTrump testified that he thought his Manhattan apartment ""was overvalued when I looked at it.""\n\n""But you never know because people come along and could say it\'s worth $250 million. It only takes one person to buy it,"" he said. ""I thought it was high and it is the brand value.""\n\n""The brand value is a very big part of the asset value of the company,"" he added. ""I could have added brand value and increased the value, and my financial statement would be very substantial.""\n\nEngoron asks Trump lawyers to control him\n\nJudge Engoron asked Trump\'s attorneys if they could control him in the courtroom. He said, ""This is not a political rally … maybe you need to have a talk with him right now.""\n\nKise calls Trump the \'future\' U.S. president, citing New York Times/Siena poll\n\nand\n\nDuring questioning, Trump attorney Chris Kise referred to his client as the future president of the United States, citing a poll released yesterday by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with Siena College, found that Trump is leading Biden in five out of six battleground states.\n\nTrump distances himself from his financial statements\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAsked about the exaggerated financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said that he knew little about them, and that banks didn\'t care about them.\n\n“All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary to supply the accountants for the statements,"" he said. ""I authorized whatever they needed to do to get their statement done.”\n\nAs for the bankers that the AG maintains were duped into giving him more favorable loans than he was entitled to, Trump said, ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump says judge will rule against him\n\nand\n\n“What did you do to meet your responsibility of preparation of the financial statement,” James’ office asked.\n\nTrump said: “Me personally? First of all this was so long ago this is past statute of limitations.”\n\nTrump then insisted that Engoron will “rule against me because he will always rule against me.”\n\nEngoron pushed back, saying that Trump’s claim isn’t true, and asked him to please answer the question again: “You can attack me all you want, but just answer the question.”\n\nJudge tells Trump to be more \'responsive\'\n\nAt one point as Trump started to testify, Engoron asked him to ""please move it along and answer the questions.""\n\n""Some of the questions haven\'t been responsive,"" the judge added.\n\nTrump looked ahead as the judge said this, never turning toward him.\n\nTrump claims bankers didn’t pay attention to the financial statements\n\nand\n\nTrump said his team will bring in bankers who ""paid little attention"" to financial documents.\n\n“This crazy trial goes along. We will bring in bankers. They will explain what the process is,"" he said. ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump rails against AG and prosecutors, calling them \'all haters\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the AG\'s office, asked Trump about the appointment and acceptance of trustees, and in response, he said, ""You and every other Democrat … coming after me from 15 different sides … all haters.""\n\nHe was referring to the New York attorney general and U.S. attorneys.\n\nTrump has been sworn in\n\nTrump has been sworn in inside the courtroom, kicking off his testimony.\n\nTrump has taken the stand\n\nThe former president is now in the witness stand, where he will be questioned by prosecutors.\n\nTrump and Engoron enter courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom and is seated at the defense table with his hands clasped together.\n\nHe\'s been chatting with his lawyers, Chris Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has entered the courtroom.\n\nIt will be a tale of two Donalds on Monday: The one inside court, who has generally maintained his composure aside from a few facial expressions and a waving of the arms, and the one outside, who goes off on Engoron and his law clerk and a legal system that he claims is arrayed against him and his family.\n\nJames arrives at courthouse, says numbers \'don\'t lie\'\n\nJames arrived at the courthouse and told reporters outside that the facts and the numbers don\'t lie.\n\n""Trump has repeatedly and consistently misrepresented the value of his assets,"" she said. ""I’m certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting and call this a witch hunt. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friends, don’t lie.""\n\nOnce inside, James greeted the prosecutors in a show of support, shaking hands with the visitors sitting in the front row.\n\nWhat to expect from Trump\'s testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to take the witness stand in a New York courtroom Monday, testifying in a high-stakes civil case that could lead to the dismantling of his sprawling business empire.\n\nHe was deposed in April after James filed her bombshell suit alleging that he and his company inflated their assets to the tune of billions of dollars to get more favorable rates from banks and insurers, and his answers there are likely to be a guidepost about how he’ll be questioned Monday.\n\nTrump spent about seven hours in the deposition answering questions from the attorney general’s office and disavowing responsibility for the annual statements of financial condition, which say “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump testified that he considered the financial statements as being “worthless” and not “important” because they contained a clause that said, “the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon the disposition of the assets or payment of the related liabilities.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump referred to that as a “clause in there that says, don’t believe the statement, go and do your own work. The statement is worthless. It means nothing.”\n\nIn his Oct. 2 ruling, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe courtroom is at full capacity ahead of Trump\'s testimony\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe courtroom has reached full capacity in anticipation of Trump\'s testimony today.\n\nThe line to get into the courtroom is still long and the number of photographers in the hallway is the highest it has been since the beginning of the trial. Some friends of the judge and his clerk are seated in the front row excited to witness history.\n\nEngoron has expanded a gag order to include members of the former president\'s legal team. The order was issued after the judge claimed they made “inappropriate remarks” about his law clerk.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are outside the courthouse\n\nand\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters gathered outside the courthouse this morning, holding a banner that reads, ""Invoke the 14th.""\n\nThe protesters advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump to block him from the ballot in his 2024 presidential run briefly stopped traffic along Centre Street. Police moved them across the street into Foley Square and traffic has since resumed.\n\nTrump leaves for the courthouse\n\nTrump\'s motorcade has departed from Trump Tower and is en route to the courthouse.\n\nTrump lashes out at Engoron and James ahead of testimony\n\nAhead of his highly anticipated testimony today, Trump took aim at Engoron and James in a post on Truth Social this morning, despite Engoron\'s gag order barring the former president and his lawyers from discussing the judge’s staff.\n\nIn his post, Trump denied wrongdoing as he repeated his claims that the trial is a political hit job against him orchestrated by Engoron and James.\n\n""Got a really Biased, Nasty, Club controlled, but often overturned, Judge, a Racist, Evil, and Corrupt Attorney General, BUT A CASE THAT, ACCORDING TO ALMOST ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS, HAS ZERO MERIT,"" he wrote. ""A dark day for our Country. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nTrump testified in the trial briefly — and then stormed out of court\n\nTrump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nTrump’s abrupt departure appeared to surprise even his own lawyers and his Secret Service agents, who went scurrying after him. He returned to the courtroom in Manhattan after the court day ended and after Cohen finished his contentious testimony.\n\nEngoron handed down the financial penalty after having called Trump to testify under oath in the afternoon about whom he was talking about when he told reporters earlier in the day that the person sitting next to the judge was “very partisan.”\n\nTrump said he was referring to Cohen, whom he has called a rat, a liar and a felon. Engoron said he found Trump’s brief testimony “not credible.” He fined Trump for violating the gag order he issued this month after Trump had smeared his law clerk on social media.\n\nA red-faced and angry-looking Trump stormed out of the courtroom about 45 minutes later after Engoron denied a motion from his lawyers on a separate legal issue.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHighlights from Eric Trump and Don Jr.\'s testimony last week\n\nDuring his testimony last week, Eric largely asserted that he lacked knowledge of the details of Trump Organization property appraisals and financial statements. The former president’s second-oldest son described himself as a “construction guy,” saying, “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals.”\n\nAt one point, however, he did acknowledge an awareness of his father’s financial statements dating as far back as 2013.\n\nTrump\'s eldest son, Don Jr., the first of the two to take the stand, said during his testimony that he didn’t recall the details of several documents shown to him in court. He added that he relied on the Trump Organization’s accountants and accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise, meanwhile, continued Friday to complain about the judge, pointing to stories in right-wing news outlets alleging Engoron and his clerk have made political donations to Democrats. Kise pointed to a story that alleged the clerk made donations in excess of legal limits for court staff in violation of court rules, and that the judge was notified and did nothing about it, which Kise said could be grounds for a mistrial if true.\n\nEngoron called the allegations untrue, adding, ""It\'s a shame we have descended to this level.""'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211133180/trump-spars-with-new-york-judge-as-he-testifies-in-civil-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial - NPR', 'Snippet': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial Things got testy Monday when former President Donald Trump took the witness stand in his civil fraud trial in New York. Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the witness stand yesterday at a New York courthouse. He was there to answer questions related to fraudulent financial statements made by the Trump Organization, statements that were used to secure business and credit deals with banks and also to measure Trump\'s net worth. New York\'s attorney general is accusing Trump, along with several associates, of knowingly committing fraud by inflating the value of these assets. NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo was in the courthouse, and she\'s with us now to tell us what she saw. Good morning.\n\nXIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: Ximena, we keep hearing how it got pretty testy in there. What can you tell us about that?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, it didn\'t take long for the pair to clash. This is not the first time that they met face to face. Trump has come to multiple days of this trial, even though he\'s not required to. And don\'t forget that he was called up to the witness stand once before by Judge Arthur Engoron himself to answer questions about comments he made that violated a gag order. Now, yesterday during the first hour, there were some tense exchanges between the judge and Trump\'s legal team, Engoron at one point beseeching the Trump team to, quote, ""control him."" And that was his word, beseeching.\n\nAnd he felt Trump was going on long speeches, and some that included tangents about his properties and political success or how he thought the judge was politically motivated. Engoron seemed to have no patience for this and even went as far as to remind Trump that this is not a political rally. Still, though, Trump called the state attorney general a political hack and doubled down on many of the personal insults that he\'s been leaning on since the start of this trial. Trump\'s team also argued that the nature of this case, being that Trump is a frontrunner for the GOP nomination and there is no jury, should warrant longer answers than perhaps the judge wants.\n\nMARTIN: Speaking of those facts, let\'s just recap those briefly. New York Attorney General Letitia James says Trump was part of an effort to inflate and sometimes deflate the value of Trump Organization assets to get better deals. Trump and his co-defendants have actually already been found liable for fraud, so this trial will decide the potential punishment. James wants them banned from doing business in the state and $250 million in penalties. So what further arguments has the prosecution made?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, the attorney general\'s team has brought up various witnesses who worked within the Trump Organization and the accounting firm Mazars to generally ask about how these documents were created. And this includes the literal math - we\'ve been staring at a ton of spreadsheets - but also the hierarchy and power influence that higher-ranking Trump Organization executives, such as Donald Trump, may have had.\n\nUltimately, the executives of the Trump Organization, including Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., signed off on these statements that have already been found to be fraudulent and may have been responsible for them, even if they didn\'t do the number crunching themselves. Still, though, some witnesses have testified that Trump did want the numbers to be higher for certain perks, like landing on the Forbes Top 100 list.\n\nMARTIN: So we heard two of the president\'s sons, Eric and Don Jr., testify last week. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, is due to take the witness stand tomorrow. What can we expect to hear from her?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, Ivanka is the last witness that the attorney general\'s team is putting forward. And unlike her brothers, she is not a defendant. Her attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in. But the attorney general\'s team plans to rest their case after that, and then the Trump team will begin to lay out their case the following week.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo.

The former president’s lawyers believed on Wednesday afternoon they had at least a small reprieve from a possible indictment. Trump praised the perceived delay.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had other plans.\n\nThursday afternoon, Bragg asked the grand jury to return an historic indictment against Trump, the first time that a current or former US president has been indicted. The surprise move was the final twist in an investigation that’s taken a long and winding road to the history-making charges that were returned this week.\n\nAn indictment had been anticipated early last week – including by Trump himself, who promoted a theory he would be “arrested” – as law enforcement agencies prepared for the logistics of arraigning a former president. But after the testimony of Robert Costello – a lawyer who appeared on Trump’s behalf seeking to undercut the credibility of Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen – Bragg appeared to hit the pause button.\n\nCostello’s testimony caused the district attorney’s office to reassess whether Costello should be the last witness the grand jury heard before prosecutors asked them to vote on an indictment, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nSo they waited. The next day the grand jury was scheduled to meet, jurors were told not to come in. Bragg and his top prosecutors huddled the rest of the week and over the weekend to determine a strategy that would effectively counter Costello’s testimony in the grand jury.\n\nThey called two additional witnesses. David Pecker, the former head of the company that publishes the National Enquirer, appeared on Monday. The other witness, who has still not been identified, testified on Thursday for 35 minutes in front of the grand jury – just before prosecutors asked them to vote on the indictment of more than 30 counts, the sources said.\n\nTrump and his attorneys, thinking Bragg might be reconsidering a potential indictment, were all caught off-guard, sources said. Some of Trump’s advisers had even left Palm Beach on Wednesday following news reports that the grand jury was taking a break, the sources added.\n\nAfter the indictment, Trump ate dinner with his wife, Melania, Thursday evening and smiled while he greeted guests at his Mar-a-Lago club, according to a source familiar with the event.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into Trump has been ongoing for years, dating back to Bragg’s predecessor, Cy Vance. Its focus shifted by mid-2020 to the accuracy of the Trump Org.’s financial statements. At the time, prosecutors debated legal theories around the hush money payments and thought they were a long shot. At several points, the wide-ranging investigation seemed to have been winding down – to the point that prosecutors resigned in protest last year. One even wrote a book critical of Bragg for not pursuing charges against Trump released just last month.\n\nThe specific charges against Trump still remain under seal and are expected to be unveiled Tuesday when Trump is set to be arraigned.\n\nThere are questions swirling even among Trump critics over whether the Manhattan district attorney’s case is the strongest against the former president amid additional investigations in Washington, DC, and Georgia over both his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at his Florida resort.\n\nTrump could still face charges in those probes, too, which are separate from the New York indictment.\n\nBut it’s the Manhattan indictment, dating back to a payment made before the 2016 presidential election, that now sees Trump facing down criminal charges for the first time as he runs again for the White House in 2024.\n\nA $130,000 hush money payment\n\nIt was just weeks before the 2016 election when Cohen, Trump’s then-lawyer, paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair with Trump. (Trump has denied the affair.) Cohen was later reimbursed $420,000 by the Trump Organization to cover the original payment and tax liabilities and to reward him with a bonus.\n\nThat payment and reimbursement are keys at issue in the investigation.\n\nCohen also helped arrange a $150,000 payment from the publisher of the National Enquirer to Karen McDougal to kill her story claiming a 10-month affair with Trump. Trump also denies an affair with McDougal. During the grand jury proceedings, the district attorney’s office has asked questions about the “catch and kill” deal with McDougal.\n\nWhen Cohen was charged by federal prosecutors in New York in 2018 and pleaded guilty, he said he was acting at the direction of Trump when he made the payment.\n\nAt the time, federal prosecutors had determined they could not seek to indict Trump in the scheme because of US Justice Department regulations against charging a sitting president. In 2021, after Trump left the White House, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York decided not to pursue a case against Trump, according to a recent book from CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig.\n\nBut then-Manhattan District Attorney Vance’s team had already picked up the investigation into the hush money payments and begun looking at potential state law violations. By summer 2019, they sent subpoenas to the Trump Org., other witnesses, and met with Cohen, who was serving a three-year prison sentence.\n\nVance’s investigation broadened to the Trump Org.’s finances. New York prosecutors went to the Supreme Court twice to enforce a subpoena for Trump’s tax records from his long-time accounting firm Mazars USA. The Trump Org. and its long-time chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were indicted on tax fraud and other charges in June 2021 for allegedly running an off-the-books compensation scheme for more than a decade.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded guilty to the charges last year and is currently serving a five-month sentence at Rikers Island. Prosecutors had hoped to flip Weisselberg to cooperate against Trump, but he would not tie Trump to any wrongdoing.\n\nDisagreements about the pace of the investigation had caused at least three career prosecutors to move off the investigation. They were concerned that the investigation was moving too quickly, without clear evidence to support possible charges, CNN and others reported last year.\n\nVance authorized the attorneys on the team to present evidence to the grand jury near the end of 2021, but he did not seek an indictment. Those close to Vance say he wanted to leave the decision to Bragg, the newly elected district attorney.\n\nResignations after Bragg took office\n\nBragg, a Democrat, took office in January 2022. Less than two months into his tenure, two top prosecutors who had worked on the Trump case under Vance abruptly resigned amid a disagreement in the office over the strength of the case against Trump.\n\nOn February 22, 2022, Bragg informed the prosecution team that he was not prepared to authorize charges against Trump, CNN reported. The prosecutors, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, resigned the next day.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Pomerantz said he believed Trump was guilty of numerous felonies and said that Bragg’s decision to not move forward with an indictment at the time was “wrong” and a “grave failure of justice.”\n\n“I and others believe that your decision not to authorize prosecution now will doom any future prospects that Mr. Trump will be prosecuted for the criminal conduct we have been investigating,” Pomerantz wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by CNN.\n\nAt that point, the investigation was focused on Trump’s financial statements and whether he knowingly misled lenders, insurers, and others by providing them false or misleading information about the value of his properties.\n\nProsecutors were building a wide-ranging falsified business records case to include years of financial statements and the hush money payments, people with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN. But at the time, those prosecutors believed there was a good chance a felony charge related to the hush money payment would be dismissed by a judge because it was a novel legal theory.\n\nDunne and Pomerantz pushed to seek an indictment of Trump tied to the sweeping falsified business records case, but others, including some career prosecutors, were skeptical that they could win a conviction at trial, in part because of the difficulty in proving Trump’s criminal intent.\n\n‘Following the leads in front of us’\n\nDespite the resignations of the prosecutors on the Trump case, Bragg’s office reiterated at the time that the investigation was ongoing.\n\n“Investigations are not linear so we are following the leads in front of us. That’s what we’re doing,” Bragg told CNN in April 2022. “The investigation is very much ongoing.”\n\nAt the same time that Bragg’s criminal investigation into Trump lingered last year, another prosecution against the Trump Org. moved forward. In December, two Trump Org. entities were convicted at trial on 17 counts and were ordered to pay $1.6 million, the maximum penalty, the following month.\n\nTrump was not personally charged in that case. But it appeared to embolden Bragg’s team to sharpen their focus back to Trump and the hush money payment.\n\nCohen was brought back in to meet with Manhattan prosecutors. Cohen had previously met with prosecutors in the district attorney’s office 13 times over the course of the investigation. But the January meeting was the first in more than a year – and a clear sign of the direction prosecutors were taking.\n\nAs investigators inched closer to a charging decision, Bragg was faced with more public pressure to indict Trump: Pomerantz, the prosecutor who had resigned a year prior, released a book about the investigation that argued Trump should be charged and criticized Bragg for failing to do so.\n\n“Every single member of the prosecution team thought that his guilt was established,” Pomerantz said in a February interview on “CNN This Morning.”\n\nAsked about Bragg’s hesitance, Pomerantz said: “I can’t speak in detail about what went through his mind. I can surmise from what happened at the time and statements that he’s made since that he had misgivings about the strength of the case.”\n\nBragg responded in a statement saying that more work was needed on the case. “Mr. Pomerantz’s plane wasn’t ready for takeoff,” Bragg said.\n\nProsecutors continued bringing in witnesses, including Pecker, the former head of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer. In February, Trump Org. controller Jeffrey McConney testified before the grand jury. Members of Trump’s 2016 campaign, including Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks, also appeared. In March, Daniels met with prosecutors, her attorney said.\n\nAnd Cohen, after his numerous meetings with prosecutors, finally testified before the grand jury in March.\n\nA final witness and an historic vote\n\nThe second week of March, prosecutors gave the clearest sign to date that the investigation was nearing its conclusion – they invited Trump to appear before the grand jury.\n\nPotential defendants in New York are required by law to be notified and invited to appear before a grand jury weighing charges.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump attorney Susan Necheles told CNN she met with New York prosecutors to argue why Trump shouldn’t be indicted and that prosecutors didn’t articulate the specific charges they are considering.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, took to his social media to predict his impending indictment. In a post attacking Bragg on March 18, Trump said the “leading Republican candidate and former president of the United States will be arrested on Tuesday of next week.”\n\n“Protest, take our nation back,” Trump added, echoing the calls he made while he tried to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump’s prediction would turn out to be premature.\n\nTrump’s call for protests after a potential indictment led to meetings between senior staff members from the district attorney’s office, the New York Police Department and the New York State Court Officers – who provide security at the criminal court building in lower Manhattan.\n\nTrump’s lawyers also made a last-ditch effort to fend off an indictment. At the behest of Trump’s team, Costello, who advised Cohen in 2018, provided emails and testified to the grand jury on Monday, March 20, alleging that Cohen had said in 2018 that he had decided on his own to make the payment to Daniels.\n\nCostello’s testimony appeared to delay a possible indictment – for a brief time at least.\n\nDuring the void, Trump continued to launch verbal insults against Bragg, calling him a “degenerate psychopath.” And four Republican chairmen of the most powerful House committees wrote to Bragg asking him to testify, which Bragg’s office said was unprecedented interference in a local investigation. An envelope containing a suspicious white powder and a death threat to Bragg was to delivered to the building where the grand jury meets – the powder was deemed nonhazardous.\n\nThe grand jury would not meet again until Monday, March 27, when Pecker was ushered back to the grand jury in a government vehicle with tinted windows in a failed effort to evade detection by the media camped outside of the building where the grand jury meets.\n\nPecker, a longtime friend of Trump’s who had a history of orchestrating so-called “catch and kill” deals while at the National Enquirer, was involved with the Daniels’ deal from the beginning.\n\nTwo days after Pecker’s testimony, there were multiple reports that the grand jury was going into a pre-planned break in April. The grand jury was set to meet Thursday but it was not expected to hear the Trump case.\n\nInstead, the grand jury heard from one last witness in the Trump case on Thursday, whose identity is still unknown. And then the grand jury shook up the American political system by voting to indict a former president and 2024 candidate for the White House.'}}",92.91666666666667,1

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

Then, she said, things went off the rails.\n\nLake compared her rival, Democrat Katie Hobbs, to Biden for her lack of visibility on the campaign trail, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nWhile Biden spent some of the 2020 campaign working from his basement because of COVID-19 concerns, Hobbs is equally underground, Lake suggested. “I call her ‘Basement Hobbs,’” she said.\n\nThe real attraction was Trump\n\nThe crowd at Bell Bank Park in Mesa had staying power.\n\nAs temperatures climbed to 88 degrees under an intense sun, the crowd showed few signs of thinning as people waited for Trump to arrive on stage. Packed, standing shoulder to shoulder, they waited nearly two hours after Lake had finished her speech. In the meantime, they were entertained by a soundtrack that ranged from ""Phantom of the Opera"" to Elvis to Hot Tramp.\n\nFor many of the thousands who attended Sunday, the draw was Trump more so than the Arizona candidates.\n\nAnn-Marie Villicana drove to the southeast Valley from Pasadena, Calif., with Robin Salzer on Saturday. A founder of LA Trump, a group that supports the former president, Villicana said she wanted to add to the enthusiasm for a strong Republican turnout in the midterms and particularly for Kari Lake.\n\nSalzer said he thinks frustration is bringing people out to events like this.\n\n“People are just fed up, and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” he said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Elgin and four friends flew in from Oregon, sporting their red and white Oregon Women for Trump T-shirts.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” she said.\n\nGet ready for lines at the polls Nov. 8\n\nAn informal survey of attendees as they waited for Trump’s arrival showed elections officials should prepare for lines at the polls.\n\nPerson after person leaning against the metal gates that hemmed in the crowd said they would vote at the polls on Nov. 8 because they don’t trust mail-in voting.\n\n“I like to see it go in,” one man said of watching his ballot get fed into the tabulation machine.\n\nTheir attitudes reflect increased skepticism about the reliability of early voting, or vote by mail, that has grown since the 2020 election.\n\nTrump alluded to that distrust in his talk.\n\n“Sometimes the mail-in ballots are just not as good as being out there on Nov. 8,” he said.\n\n“If you can, vote in person on election day,” Trump said. “Because it’s a lot harder for them to cheat.” He did not clarify who he was referring to.\n\nTrump said those who vote by mail risk getting a “potentially fake ballot.”\n\nThere is no evidence of that ever occurring in Arizona.\n\nIn the August primary, Republican voters showed an uptick in voting at the polls, although voting by mail remained by far the most popular form of voting, used by 85% of voters in Maricopa County.\n\nRepublic reporter Alison Steinbach contributed to this article.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1009063/trump-mocks-and-criticizes-biden-at-rally-in-arizona', 'Headline': 'Trump mocks and criticizes Biden at rally in Arizona', 'Snippet': 'published 16 January 2022.

Whether you had it or not, say it,” Trump said in an interview that aired Tuesday night on the conservative One America News Network.\n\nTrump had booster shot\n\nTrump, who was booed last month by supporters after revealing he had gotten a booster shot, has become increasingly vocal in calling out those who have questioned the vaccines’ efficacy and safety.\n\n“Well, I’ve taken it. I’ve had the booster,” Trump said in the interview. “I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed and one of the questions was, ‘Did you get the booster?’ …. And they, ‘Oh, oh,’ they’re answering it — like in other words, the answer is ‘Yes,’ but they don’t want to say it. Because they’re gutless.”\n\nTrump praised vaccines\n\nIn an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens, Trump stressed how well the vaccines work at preventing hospitalization and serious illness.\n\n“The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take their vaccine,” he told her. “People aren’t dying when they take their vaccine.”\n\nWhat is Trump’s net worth?\n\nFormer president Trump said his net worth was $10billion before the 2017 election, but it was found to be far less than that.\n\nIn 2016, his net worth was $4.7billion, but since then it has dropped to $2.5billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThis is down by $600million since the pandemic started in early 2020.\n\nThe Trump Organization, of which he serves as president and chairman, owns plush resorts, residential towers, real estates and golf courses.\n\nTrump slams Biden\'s January 6 statements\n\nTrump released a statement following Biden\'s speech on January 6, saying it was a ""political theater"" and a ""distraction"" from his belief in Biden\'s supposed failings.\n\n""...The complicit media calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the election itself.\n\n""The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America.

This was a protest and a lot of innocent people are being hurt. A lot of innocent people are being injured.""\n\nTrump\'s canceled press conference\n\nFormer President Donald Trump canceled his January 6 press conference after Republicans said it would be detrimental to their party.\n\nSenate Republicans said it is time to move on from Trump\'s claims. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) told Politico, “It’s a free country and you’re entitled to say whatever you want to say subject to some limitations, but I think the country has moved on.\n\n""I think that’s where we ought to focus our efforts, is on getting things done for the American people and not re-litigating issues that have already been decided.”\n\nTrump\'s speech would have come on the one-year anniversary of the January 6 riots to continue to claim the election was stolen.\n\nThe claims were unsubstantiated as President Joe Biden received 306 electoral votes and Trump received 232 electoral votes.\n\nHe was also expected to speak against the investigations into the January 6 riots.\n\nTrump\'s \'sippy cup\' moment at Tulsa rally\n\nIn July 2020, Trump showed the crowd at his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that he could drink a glass of water without difficulty.\n\nThe crowd roared as Trump easily chugged the water and threw the cup on the ground afterward.\n\nTrump showed off his water-drinking skills after he was savagely mocked on social media for using two hands to sip from a tiny glass of water during a speech.\n\nHis ""Watergate"" moment caused a storm on Twitter and Trump was branded ""President Sippy Cup.""\n\nTrump jokes about \'kissing\' supporters\n\nTrump tossed coronavirus masks into the crowd and offered to kiss his supporters at a packed rally in Florida in October 2020.\n\nThe then-president returned to the campaign trail hours after the White House announced he was ""not infectious"" after testing negative for COVID-19 for ""consecutive days.""\n\nSpeaking at a Sanford airport in Orlando, the maskless president called the coronavirus pandemic a ""lovefest"" and declared he was newly ""immune.""\n\nHe also said he felt ""so powerful"" — at a time when he looks to prove he\'s healthy and energetic following his coronavirus hospitalization.\n\nAnd the then-president drew laughs when he offered to give a ""big fat kiss"" to ""the guys and the beautiful women"" in the audience to prove his health and thank them for their support.\n\n""I have such respect for the people in this country the way they\'ve handled it, it\'s been an incredible lovefest together,"" he told the thousands gathered.\n\n""That\'s really what it\'s been. And sympathies from all of us to those people whose family members have died... I\'ve lost friends, I\'ve lost friends.""\n\nTrump\'s ramp rant, continued\n\nOn June 13, 2020, after finishing commencement exercises at the US Military Academy at West Point Trump was recorded walking slowly down a ramp off the stage as music played in the background.\n\nTrump was seen walking the ""slippery"" slope one flight of stairs at a time.\n\nAt the time, President Biden took a jab at Trump over his turtle pace descent, saying ""Look at how he steps and look at how I step,"" he said in September 2020.\n\n“Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps. OK? Come on.”\n\nTrump defended his slow descent at West Point, tweeting, “The last thing I was going to do is ‘fall’ for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum!”\n\nTrump\'s ramp rant\n\nOnce the former president spent around 14 minutes talking about how he can walk down ramps normally.\n\nTrump\'s slow walk down a ramp from over a year ago began trending moments after President Joe Biden tripped three times while walking up the stairs of Air Force One.\n\nOn March 19, President Biden was captured on video falling on the stairs of Air Force One before flying to Georgia.\n\nTrump\'s slow walk down the stairs of a ramp from June 13, 2020 began trending on social media after President Biden\'s latest stumble.\n\nTrump\'s celebrity endorsements\n\nTrump praised My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell on Saturday, and he has had a few celebrity endorsements.\n\nOnce Trump invited rapper Lil Pump onstage with him at his final pre-election rally as he got the celeb to endorse him.\n\nBut the former President hilariously accidentally called the rapper — who claimed he would leave the country if Biden won — Little Pimp.\n\nTrump was also endorsed for president by Sarah Palin, Hulk Hogan, and Tila Tequila.\n\nDetails on ‘Truth Social’\n\nA post on Truth Social is called a “truth” and the retweet equivalent is called a “re-truth”.\n\nTruth Social’s website now directs people to pre-order the app on the App Store.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the app will also be coming to Android or getting a desktop version on February 21.\n\nThe app is free and anyone who wants it will need to join a waiting list.\n\nWhat did Trump say in the interview, conclusion\n\nWhen asked why most US senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have not backed his election fraud claims, former President Trump replied: “Because Mitch McConnell is a loser.”\n\nAs Inskeep attempted to interject, Trump said: “So, Steve, thank you very much. I appreciate it,” and proceeded to hang up.\n\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa, I have one more question,” Inskeep said, noting that he had wanted to talk about a court hearing related to the January 6, 2021 riots at the US Capitol.\n\nWhat did Trump say in the interview, continued\n\n“She’s very big on this issue,” Trump continued, speaking of Lake.\n\n“She’s leading by a lot. People have no idea how big this issue is, and they don’t want it to happen again.”\n\n“And the only way it’s not going to happen again is you have to solve the problem of the presidential rigged election of 2020.”\n\nInterviewer Inskeep asked why elected officials in Arizona had accepted the findings of a Republican-ordered audit that uncovered no issues that would have altered the result of the 2020 presidential race in the state.\n\n“Because they’re RINOs, and frankly, a lot of people are questioning that,” Trump said, referring to the term “Republicans in name only.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://ca.yahoo.com/news/five-takeaways-donald-trump-rally-135828843.html', 'Headline': 'Five takeaways from Donald Trump’s rally in Arizona - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'Former president Donald Trump held his first rally of 2022 in Arizona, one of the focal points of his “Big Lie” that the election was rigged.

Throughout the rally, Mr Trump raged against his enemies as much in the Republican Party as well as President Joe Biden and the media.\n\nHere’s five takeaways from Mr Trump’s event in Arizona.\n\nTrump still runs the GOP\n\nKari Lake, a former Arizona news anchor and gubernatorial candidate, gave one of the rally’s opening speeches and joined Mr Trump onstage.\n\nBefore the former president arrived in Arizona, Kimberly Yee, the Republican state treasurer and also a candidate for governor, announced she would end her campaign and instead would run for state treasurer. Mr Trump also railed against Arizona’s outgoing Republican Governor Doug Ducey, whom he has loathed for not decertifying the 2020 election results.\n\n“He’s never going to get my endorsement,” he said, amid rumors Mr Ducey is considering a run for the Senate against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nMr Trump also danced on the graves of retiring Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting the US Capitol riot on January 6, most recently Rep John Katko of New York. He vocally criticized Reps Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both of whom sit on the select committee investigating the riot and the latter of whom is not seeking reelection.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. We’re getting rid of them fast,” he said.\n\nThe ‘Big Lie’ is now an article of faith\n\nMr Trump opened the rally by saying “The Big Lie is a lot of bulls***.”\n\nThroughout he spoke of how he won the election and continued to spread repeated lies on the 2020 presidential race to thunderous applause.\n\n“I ran twice and we won twice and we did better the second time. We did much better the second time,” Mr Trump said.\n\nHe also dismissed concerns about the January 6 attempted insurrection by his supporters and instead continued to repeat claims of impropriety and that Democrats used measures during the pandemic to enable mail-in voting to steal the election.\n\n“Why aren’t they investigating November 3rd a Rigged and Stolen Election,” he said. “The people are very angry. They got duped and they found out what happened. The people have to be free to find the answers and if not, they will never trust again and our country will be absolutely decimated.”\n\nTrump openly espoused conspiracy theories about January 6 and sympathy for rioters\n\nThe former president has long promoted conspiracy theories unrelated to the election. But throughout the rally, Mr Trump openly espoused the conspiracy theory that Ray Epps - previously on the FBI’s most wanted list - was a government informant and goaded people to come into the Capitol.\n\n“Exactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants, agents or otherwise, working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government,” he said. “People want to hear this.\n\nHe also expressed sympathy for some rioters who are currently in jail awaiting trial for their actions at the US Capitol and said they are “living in hell.”\n\n“The bathrooms are horrible,” he said, adding that “If we think they’re innocent, we should help them defend themselves.”\n\nHe also repeated his sympathy for Ashli Babbitt, the pro-Trump rioter who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer after she stormed the building.\n\nLetitia James is target #1, even above Biden\n\nOne target of Mr Trump’s ire stood out from all the rest on Saturday, thanks to the former president’s social media and graphics teams.\n\nThe nearly two-hour rally was interrupted about halfway through for a pre-produced video that the former president showed his fans. In the video, which was up for less than a minute, statements made by New York Attorney General Letitia James about her desire to go after Mr Trump for longstanding accusations of fraud were highlighted.\n\nThe moment stood out, as it marked the only time in the rally that Mr Trump relinquished the microphone other than to allow remarks from Kari Lake, his favoured candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nMs James was also the only one of Mr Trump’s Democratic rivals, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to get the pre-produced attack video treatment.\n\nThe New York Attorney General is currently involved in a case pursuing the Trump Organization for fraud claims.\n\nImpeachment supporters are still on Trump’s mind\n\nNormally, it would make little sense for a president to call out a retiring, low-profile GOP congressman by name and bring him on onstage at a rally located on the opposite side of the country from their home district.\n\nBut typical logic rarely applies to Trump rallies. On Saturday, Mr Trump named and shamed Representative John Katko, a Republican from New York, over his announcement that he would retire and not seek reelection this year.\n\nThe move would normally be seen as a blow for the Republican Party, which hopes to retain control of Mr Katko’s district (which leans slightly Democratic) and retake the House this fall.\n\nBut not so for Mr Trump, de facto leader of the GOP, who sees Mr Katko as the enemy following the latter’s support for the second impeachment of the former president last year in the wake of the January 6 riot.\n\n“They’re falling fast and furious. The ones that voted to impeach, we’re getting rid of them fast,” he told his supporters.\n\nNaming the New York congressman, he added: “And John Katko is now gone, we just got rid of Katko.”\n\nThe announcement was met with a smattering of applause. However the majority of the crowd appeared not to associate the name with the effort to impeach Mr Trump, as it did with bigger-name Republicans like Reps Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThe president’s second impeachment trial ended without conviction but nevertheless saw the greatest defection by a president’s party of any impeachment effort in history.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-rally-arizona-heated-gop-034812381.html', 'Headline': 'Trump holds first 2022 rally in Arizona as heated GOP Senate ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'ANDY JACOBSOHN/AFP via Getty Images.

He has not yet picked a Senate candidate to take on incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\nThe Republicans who are vying to challenge Kelly include Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, solar power executive Jim Lamon, venture capitalist Blake Masters and retired Air Force Major General Michael ""Mick"" McGuire.\n\nDemocrats have won the last two Senate races in Arizona, including the 2020 special election when Kelly defeated former Senator Martha McSally by 2.4 points. Kelly, a retired astronaut, is serving the remainder of the late Arizona Senator John McCain\'s term and must run again this year for a full six-year term.\n\nTrump isn\'t expected to endorse anyone Saturday — Arizona\'s primary is August 2, and sources familiar with the race believe Trump is waiting to see how the race shapes up before he decides on a candidate.\n\nHis endorsement is powerful, but it doesn\'t always clear the field. North Carolina Congressman Ted Budd, for instance, is in a tough race against former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. And in Alabama, Trump-endorsed Congressman Mo Brooks is locked in a tight contest against Katie Britt, who was retiring Senator Richard Shelby\'s chief of staff.\n\nTrump remains popular with Arizona Republicans. Though his endorsement failed to carry McSally to victory in the 2018 or 2020, it would be influential in the primary.\n\n""If you\'re any candidate in this race for Senate, you want his endorsement,"" said Chris DeRose, a lawyer and former Brnovich staffer in the state attorney general\'s office. ""Do you need it to win? No. But you\'d be crazy not to want it.""\n\nIn November, Trump attended a fundraiser that Masters held at Mar-a-Lago. Masters, who is the president of billionaire Peter Thiel\'s foundation and holds a Stanford law degree, told CBS News that winning the race becomes ""a lot harder"" without Trump\'s endorsement, but he\'s sure the former president won\'t back any of his opponents.\n\nBrnovich has been the front runner in the race and his supporters are counting on his record on immigration to help him in the primary. A source familiar with the race said that Trump and Brnovich speak regularly, and Brnovich could visit Mar-a-Lago soon. Over time, Trump has become less pointed in his criticism of Brnovich over Arizona\'s election results.\n\nDays after the 2020 election, Brnovich told Fox Business ""there is no evidence, there are no facts that would lead anyone to believe that the election results will change"" and said Trump had lost because voters split their tickets. Months later, Trump was still not acknowledging his defeat and attacked Brnovich for not trying to prove the election had been stolen from him. In May, he labeled Brnovich ""lackluster"" and said he was ""nowhere to be found"" regarding the 2020 election.\n\nLamon, a veteran who launched his candidacy in May, drew attention this week after he released an advertisement this week using the anti-Biden slogan ""let\'s go Brandon.""\n\nDemocrats say Trump is ""creating chaos"" in the Republican primaries, ""elevating deeply flawed GOP candidates, escalating Republicans\' infighting, and forcing their candidates to attack each other over who can suck up to Trump the most,"" said Jazmin Vargas, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\n""A tightrope of floss""\n\nOne issue Republicans will have to navigate is the review of the 2020 election that Arizona Senate Republicans ordered in Maricopa County. The review, which was widely criticized by election experts, ultimately showed a wider margin of victory for President Joe Biden.\n\nMaricopa County has denied the report\'s claims of counting invalid ballots and election administration errors, saying the review was plagued by ""faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.""\n\n""The audit issue, especially for Republicans on the ticket this year, it\'s like walking a tightrope of floss,"" said Mike Noble, chief of research at the nonpartisan polling firm OH Predictive Insights.\n\nLamon is leaning into the Maricopa review and said it highlighted enough issues ""to move that election into President Trump\'s column"" in Arizona. He and other Republicans sent a document to Congress falsely claiming they were the state\'s electors. He told CBS News that he didn\'t regret this because slates of electors have to be submitted by a certain date, and he claimed Republicans wanted to be prepared ""if in fact this election was decertified.""\n\nMasters said in November that he thinks Trump won the 2020 election.\n\n""Joe Biden is president right now,"" Masters told CBS News. ""Do I think he won a free and fair election? I don\'t. I don\'t think we had a free and fair election in 2020. If we did, I strongly suspect, truly believe that President Trump would still be president.""\n\nHe faults mail voting practices expanded by COVID and social media companies for quashing negative stories about the Bidens.\n\nMcGuire, the retired major general, told CBS News that ""there is no constitutional remedy or dispute about the fact that Joe Biden received more than 270 electoral votes."" When asked if he believed Biden won the election fairly, McGuire said he looks forward to what comes from Brnovich\'s review of findings that were turned over to the attorney general\'s office. And he\'s not the only one in the race targeting primary front runner Brnovich over the 2020 election.\n\nLamon rallied outside of Brnovich\'s office in December, calling for more action. Masters said Brnovich ""needs to hold people accountable where laws were broken"" and thinks Brnovich is trying to ""kick the can past the primary so that he can pretend to be tough on election integrity.""\n\n""It\'s always easy to take cheap shots from the cheap seats,"" a Brnovich campaign spokesperson said in a statement. ""Attorney General Brnovich remains focused on doing his duly elected job and will present the findings when his office concludes the investigation.""\n\nBrnovich\'s allies point to his victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case challenging Arizona voting laws about ballots cast in the wrong precinct and a ban on ""ballot harvesting"" and his office\'s demand that the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors comply with a subpoena related to the state Senate-ordered review of 2020.\n\nViews of the audit and 2020 election may impact moderate suburban voters in Arizona who helped carry Democrats to victory in 2020, Noble said, but other issues may be more pressing in November.\n\n""If people are feeling pain points with the economy, inflation, things of that nature, that\'s going to supersede social issues, or an audit is going to feel very distant in the voters\' memories,"" Noble said.\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration and the economy were the top issues for Republicans in a November poll by OH Predictive Insights. Migrant encounters in the Tucson sector were up 72% in October and November, over the same time period in 2020, while encounters in the Yuma were up by 2,400%, according to Customs and Border Protection data. Encounters along the southern border were very low during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n""There has always been an issue with lawlessness and misconduct at the border, but I have never seen it like it has been since the 20th of January,"" said McGuire, who served as Adjutant General of the Arizona National Guard from 2013-2021.\n\nLamon says he supports legal immigration, but worries border patrol agents are struggling to keep up with the spike in border encounters, which he deemed ""an invasion.""\n\n""They\'re coming from around the world,"" Lamon said. ""America really needs to understand that. This is a border control issue.""\n\nMasters, who worked with Thiel, wants to see stricter regulations on major technology companies.\n\n""When they control the flow of information in a free society, when they have motive and opportunity to swing elections, I think that\'s something we ought to take a look at. Right now the attitude is just complete laissez-faire,"" Masters said.\n\nLamon was the only candidate to bring up working with his counterpart in the Senate if he wins, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. ""We could be a juggernaut, Republican and Democrat, working together,"" he said.\n\nArizona Governor Doug Ducey, who has been repeatedly attacked by Trump, has said that he is not interested in running for Senate, but some allies still hope he\'ll change his mind.\n\n""He will never have my endorsement or the support of MAGA Nation!"" Trump said in a statement Friday after Politico reported that Ducey is still open to entering the race.\n\nTrump has also not endorsed in competitive primaries in Missouri or Ohio. And he hasn\'t endorsed in Pennsylvania since his preferred candidate, Sean Parnell, suspended his campaign.\n\n""Arizona, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania are all states that are a lot more complicated — there\'s no clear candidate and you might as well let it play out a little bit,"" a Trump adviser said.\n\nAll hostages at Texas syngagoue are safe and hostage-taker dead, police say\n\nHere’s how to request free at home COVID test as soon as Wednesday'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/22/trump-rallies-supporters-arizona-pivotal-primary-looms/10133926002/', 'Headline': 'Trump rallies supporters in Arizona as pivotal primary looms', 'Snippet': 'Reach reporter Stacey Barchenger at stacey.barchenger@arizonarepublic.com or 480-416-5669.

Mark Kelly, and proclaiming his own administration a success.\n\nHe also hinted at his future political plans, though he said the midterm elections were the first order of business.\n\n“You have an opportunity to vote for an outstanding slate of true conservative warriors, many of whom I know,” he said, calling Lake and Masters up onstage beside him, who offered their praise to the former president.\n\n“I just want to thank you for saving this country,” Masters told Trump, decrying the leadership of Joe Biden, saying it delivered “chaos and destruction.”\n\nAfter hugging Trump onstage, Lake told the crowd not to “sit back and wait for Superman to come in and rescue us &mldr; we’ve got to stand up, we’ve got to vote, we’ve got to get active.\n\n“Now I want to say for the record, for the record, I do believe that Superman is coming back and hopefully he’s coming back soon,” she said looking over her shoulder at Trump.\n\nPeople came from around the state and elsewhere, including Hawaii and California, to support the former president, nearly filling the arena set up to seat 5,800 people. Some people waited in the 100-degree heat for hours to get into Findlay Toyota Center, some filtered out early as the event stretched past 9:30 p.m.\n\nNancy McGill, 61, woke at 5:30 a.m. at her Tempe home and headed to the rally. Now a volunteer for Lake’s campaign, it was Trump’s endorsement that clinched her support.\n\n“I feel that’s gold,” McGill said. “Anybody that Donald Trump endorses, he has vetted very well.”\n\nJan. 6 committee, Bowers criticized\n\nTrump spoke to each of the issues Republican primary voters typically cite as important to them, including the border and education and the economy through the lens of high inflation. But the crowd’s chants and cheers swelled when he talked about his false election fraud claims or the “unselect committee” investigating his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe crowd booed at the mention of the committee. One woman yelled out, “We need you, Trump!”\n\nThe day prior, the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee heard testimony in an eighth hearing that Trump refused to call off the rioters on a day that grew so intense that the Secret Service detail assigned to former Vice President Mike Pence began calling loved ones to say goodbye.\n\nTrump also attacked witnesses who testified during those hearings, including Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Mesa Republican who rose to national prominence for withstanding Trump’s attempts to overturn the election.\n\nIn turn, Trump pumped up Bowers’ opponent in the Aug. 2 primary election, David Farnsworth.\n\nTrump reminded the audience of Bowers’ transgressions against him, calling him a ""RINO"" and a “coward” and claiming he “disgraced himself” and Arizona with his testimony and alleged backsliding on illegal immigration.\n\nSplit looms: Pence and Ducey back Taylor Robson as Trump stumps for Lake\n\nTrump’s return to Prescott Valley offered a visual reminder of the schism in the Republican Party. While he drew thousands to his rally, a few hundred people attended invite-only events earlier in the day in support of Lake’s leading opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Pence, who split with Trump after resisting pressure to overturn the 2020 election result, campaigned on Taylor Robson’s behalf.\n\nThe Friday evening rally in Prescott Valley drew a who’s-who among Trump loyalists in Arizona politics, including state Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, state Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff and notorious former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is running for mayor of Fountain Hills and got a standing ovation and raucous applause that even Trump noticed.\n\n“I didn’t know you were that popular, Joe,” Trump remarked.\n\nIf there was a star of the show that wasn’t Trump — it was Lake. While other speakers claimed just a few minutes on the rally stage, Lake energized the crowd for over 20 minutes. She frequently paused to allow cheers, or chants of “Build the wall” or “U-S-A.”\n\nShe delivered a populist appeal that touted the energy behind her campaign, particularly calling out younger voters in the room who had “so much taken from them” during the COVID-19 pandemic and at one point saying some of the “dumbest people I know have a college degree.”\n\nLake, a former Fox 10 news anchor, attacked the media in the room — many of whom she’d stopped for interviews with before the rally — without mentioning her own nearly three-decade career in television.\n\nLake called Biden an illegitimate president, said that Trump won in 2020, and said she would restore faith in elections without offering specifics of how she would do that. “No more stolen elections,” she said to cheers. After dozens of lawsuits across the nation and an Arizona Senate-led ballot review, there is no evidence to support the claim Trump won.\n\nShe pledged to finish the wall and encouraged voters to return their ballots by mail, noting she was “not a fan” of mail-in voting and attacking the state’s established voting system, though the crowd didn’t bite.\n\n“Go home, fill it out and mail it out, do not use the drop boxes, OK?” she said. When just a few people in the crowd clapped, Lake quickly quipped, “I guess no one has a mail-in, that’s great.”\n\nArizona candidates share spotlight\n\nThe event offered down-ballot candidates a few minutes in the spotlight, which could prove pivotal for undecided voters and in races with many candidates where the margins of victory might be smaller.\n\nCandidate for attorney general Abraham Hamadeh, a former prosecutor who is in a six-way primary, painted himself as the antithesis to establishment, weak Republicans. He said the state’s southern border was a “war zone” intentionally ignored by the federal government, before pivoting to elections.\n\n“Our elections have been hijacked,” he said. “Our justice system has been corrupted. It’s time to restore law and order and hold those who seek to undermine our country accountable. I want justice for what they’ve done to us. It’s time we lock up some people and put handcuffs on them.”\n\nWhen that prompted cheers of “Lock her up,” Hamadeh responded in kind: “Oh, we’ve got some motivated patriots, don’t we?”\n\nTrump, who has suggested he will run for office again in 2024, made repeated references to doing so while onstage, though made no formal announcement.\n\n“This is the year we’re going to take back the House, we’re going to take back the Senate,” he said before cheers drowned out his words. “And in 2024, the most important year, we’re going to take back our beautiful, magnificent White House.”\n\nPam Allgrove of Prescott Valley walked four blocks from her home to listen to Trump and his slate of candidates. She wore a denim ball cap with “TRUMP” spelled out in shiny sequins, flag-themed hair bands in her braids and a flag-adorned blouse.\n\nThe country is going down the “wrong path,” she said, and she hopes to see leaders elected who will fix problems at the border and in public schools, rather than those who look to enrich their own pockets — like too many current leaders are doing, she said.\n\n“They stand there and watch and they don’t act,” she said. “That’s not right.”\n\nTrump is the only politician who did what he said he would do, Allgrove said. She expects Trump-endorsed candidates to model after him.\n\n“If they say they’re going to do something, he’s going to make sure they do it,” she said.\n\nRepublic reporters Ray Stern and Greg Svirnovskiy contributed to this article.\n\nReach reporter Stacey Barchenger at stacey.barchenger@arizonarepublic.com or 480-416-5669.

Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened.\n\nMore Than 15,000 Attended Trump’s Arizona Rally\n\nThe rally took place at the Country Thunder Festival Grounds, AZ Central reported. Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. MST, with doors opening for the rally at 2 p.m. His speech began a bit later than scheduled, at about 7:17 p.m. Other speakers included Kari Lake, state Rep. Mark Finchem, Rep. Paul Gosar, Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Debbie Lesko, Kelli Ward, Mike Lindell, and Boris Epshteyn, Axios reported.\n\nIn the afternoon, just a couple of hours after doors opened, thousands of people were already at the festival grounds, AZ Central reported. The publication noted that traffic was stalled for about an hour outside the rally venue, and some attendees still hadn’t gotten inside after waiting more than three hours.\n\nYahoo! News (via the Arizona Republic) reported that more than 15,000 were in attendance at the rally. Meanwhile, Liz Willis of the right-wing network RSBN had indicated during the rally that attendance was about 20,000, according to a tweet that her official account retweeted. The Town of Florence Police Department had written on January 13 that they projected an attendance of close to 30,000.\n\nSteven Monacelli of Rolling Stone, The Daily Beast, and Dallas Weekly tweeted that when he arrived at the rally, he and other members of the press were told the press tower was full, even while others were still being let in the gates.\n\nHe later shared that although some of the press who were with him weren’t allowed inside, he was able to get into the rally.\n\nEd Henry of the conservative publication Real America’s Voice shared these photos of the crowd.\n\nWill Steakin of ABC News tweeted that Anthony Kern, a former Arizona lawmaker who was at the Capitol on January 6, addressed the crowd before Trump and told the rally: “This is our 1776 movement.”\n\nSteakin said the crowd could be heard saying “lock him up” at one point, in reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHere’s another crowd photo, shared by Monacelli on Twitter:\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, he called Biden “a disaster” for the country and let Kari Lake join him briefly on the stage. Lake is the Republican candidate for governor.\n\nHe also vowed during his speech to have his own investigation of the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nSteakin reported that Trump’s rally ended with a new song by Sam and Dave called, “Hold on I’m Coming.”\n\nOn Twitter, the video below was shared showing the crowd at the rally.\n\nTrump said in the video above that some officials indicated this might be the “single biggest crowd seen yet.” However, other Trump rallies have recorded attendance numbers larger than the current estimate of 15,000. A 2019 Minneapolis Trump rally, for example, had a low estimate of 20,000, not including overflow. Trump did add: “and they’re not just talking about Arizona,” to his statement about the crowd size.\n\nThis Was Trump’s First Rally of 2022\n\nThis was Trump’s first rally of 2022. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines.

Here are the key details and ...', 'Snippet': 'Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday.', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112323797/jan-6-hearing-recap-187-minutes', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 panel details what Trump did — and did not do - NPR', 'Snippet': ""The hearing, led by military veterans Reps.

Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., used witness testimony to piece together Trump\'s actions the afternoon of Jan. 6, as there was not an official call log from the White House that afternoon and nothing included in the presidential daily diary.\n\n""The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, \'very important for his archives and for history.\' But she was told: \'no photographs\',"" Luria said.\n\nWhite House counsel and White House officials testified that Trump did not make any calls to the secretary of defense, the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security during the siege.\n\nAlthough the White House call logs are empty, Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani\'s call logs show at least two calls between him and the president that day. The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more. They\'re literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung.\'\n\nHutchinson recalled Meadow responding: \'You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.\' ""\n\nTrump eventually relented to calls from his aides and allies and recorded a video in the Rose Garden late that afternoon to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nThe committee shared a draft of his remarks, which read: ""I\'m asking for you to leave the Capitol region now and go home in a peaceful way.""\n\nBut in the video, Trump went off script, and didn\'t say those words. Instead, he repeated his false claim that the election was stolen and praised the rioters, saying, ""Go home, we love you.""\n\nThursday\'s witnesses were Trump aides who resigned following Jan. 6\n\nTestifying live Thursday were Matthew Pottinger, Trump\'s deputy national security adviser at the time, and Sarah Matthews, Trump\'s deputy press secretary. The pair resigned following the events of Jan. 6, dismayed by what they deemed an inadequate response from the president at quelling the violence.\n\nMatthews recalled the 2:24 p.m. ET tweet from Trump that read, in part: ""Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done.""\n\n""I thought that the tweet about the vice president was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the green light to these people telling them that what they were doing at the Capitol and entering the Capitol was OK, that they were justified in their anger,"" said Matthews, who described herself as a ""life-long Republican"".\n\nShe added that as a Trump campaign aide, she had seen the impact his words had on his supporters. ""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/jan-6-final-report-capitol-1.6696232', 'Headline': ""Jan. 6 committee's final report finds Trump was 'central cause' of ..."", 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee\'s final report asserts that Donald Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to ...', 'Full_text': 'The House Jan. 6 committee\'s final report asserts that Donald Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the U.S. Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection almost two years ago.\n\nThe 845-page report released Thursday comes after the panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, held 10 hearings and obtained millions of pages of documents.\n\nThe witnesses — ranging from many of Trump\'s closest aides to law enforcement to some of the rioters themselves — detailed Trump\'s actions in the weeks ahead of the insurrection and how his wide-ranging pressure campaign to overturn his defeat directly influenced those who brutally pushed past the police and smashed through the windows and doors of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n""The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump,"" reads the report.

The lawmakers describe his pressure on states, federal officials, lawmakers and former vice-president Mike Pence to game the system or break the law.\n\nIn the two months between the election and the insurrection, the report says, ""President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.""\n\nTrump\'s repeated, false claims of widespread voter fraud resonated with his supporters, the committee said, and were amplified on social media, building on the distrust of government he had fostered for his four years in office. And he did little to stop them when they resorted to violence and stormed the Capitol.\n\nThe massive, damning report comes as Trump is running again for the presidency and also facing multiple federal investigations, including probes of his role in the insurrection and the presence of classified documents at his Florida estate.\n\nThis week is particularly fraught for him, as a House committee is expected to release his tax returns after he has fought for years to keep them private. And Trump has been blamed by Republicans for a worse-than-expected showing in November\'s midterm elections, leaving him in his most politically vulnerable state since he won the 2016 election.\n\nPosting on his social media site, Trump called the report ""highly partisan"" and falsely claimed it didn\'t include his statement on Jan. 6 that his supporters should protest ""peacefully and patriotically."" The committee noted he followed that comment with election falsehoods and charged language exhorting the crowd to ""fight like hell.""\n\nThe report details a multitude of failings by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But it makes an emphatic point that security failures are not what led to the insurrection.\n\n187 minutes\n\n""The President of the United States inciting a mob to march on the Capitol and impede the work of Congress is not a scenario our intelligence and law enforcement communities envisioned for this country,"" the committee\'s chairman, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, writes in a separate foreword.\n\nThe report details Trump\'s inaction as his loyalists were violently storming the building. Returning to the White House from his fiery speech, he asked an employee if they had seen his remarks on television.\n\n""Sir, they cut it off because they\'re rioting down at the Capitol,"" the staffer said, according to the report.\n\nRead the final report from the committee:\n\nA White House photographer snapped a picture of Trump at 1:21 p.m., learning of the riot from the employee. ""By that time, if not sooner, he had been made aware of the violent riot at the Capitol,"" the report states.\n\nIn total, 187 minutes elapsed between the time Trump finished his speech at the Ellipse and his first effort to get the rioters to disperse, through an eventual video message in which he asked his supporters to go home even as he reassured them, ""We love you, you\'re very special.""\n\nDuring those hours, dozens of staffers and associates pleaded with him to make a forceful statement. But he did not.\n\nThe committee quotes some of Trump\'s most loyal supporters blaming him for the violence.\n\n""We all look like domestic terrorists now,"" longtime aide Hope Hicks texted Julie Radford, who served as Ivanka Trump\'s chief of staff, in the aftermath.\n\nHicks also texted a White House lawyer: ""I\'m so upset. Everything we worked for wiped away.""\n\nThe investigation\'s release is a final act for House Democrats, who are ceding power to Republicans in less than two weeks, and have spent much of their four years in power investigating Trump. Democrats impeached Trump twice, the second time a week after the insurrection. He was acquitted by the Senate both times. Other Democratic-led probes investigated his finances, his businesses, his foreign ties and his family.\n\nOn Monday, the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans officially passed their investigation to the Justice Department, recommending the department investigate the former president on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection. While the criminal referrals have no legal standing, they are a final statement from the committee after its extensive, year-and-a-half-long probe.\n\nTrump has tried to discredit the report, slamming members of the committee as ""thugs and scoundrels"" as he has continued to falsely dispute his 2020 loss.\n\nIn response to the panel\'s criminal referrals, Trump said: ""These folks don\'t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me.""\n\nInterview transcripts released\n\nThe committee has also begun to release hundreds of transcripts of its interviews. On Thursday, the panel released transcripts of two closed-door interviews with former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who testified in person at one of the televised hearings over the summer and described in vivid detail Trump\'s efforts to influence the election results and indifference toward the violence as it occurred.\n\nIn the two interviews, both conducted after her July appearance at the hearing, she described how many of Trump\'s allies, including her lawyer, pressured her not to say too much in her committee interviews.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-committee-unveils-final-report-capping-18-month-probe-rcna62629', 'Headline': ""Jan. 6 committee report details the scope of Trump's pressure campaign ..."", 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 panel, led by Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., believes there is enough evidence for the Justice Department to prosecute Trump on four specific charges, including obstruction ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee on Thursday unveiled its formal report, the final product of its historic 18-month investigation into the deadly attack on the Capitol and former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n“[A]fter nearly a year and a half of investigation, I am frightened about the peril our democracy faced.

Afterward, he sent them to the Capitol to try to prevent my colleagues and me from doing our Constitutional duty to certify the election.""\n\n""They put our very democracy to the test,” he added.\n\nThe committee released the 845-page report days after a final committee meeting at which its nine members — seven Democrats and two Republicans — voted to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against Trump as he makes another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\nIt was the first time in history that a congressional committee had made criminal referrals for a U.S. president. The Jan. 6 panel, led by Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., believes there is enough evidence for the Justice Department to prosecute Trump on four specific charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding — Congress’ certification of electoral votes — and inciting or assisting others in an insurrection.\n\nAmong the committee’s nearly dozen recommendations listed at the end of the report: Urging Congress to create a way to evaluate whether Trump and others who took part in the 2020 election plot should be banned from holding future office.\n\nConsistent with the committee’s series of summer hearings and its executive summary, the full report — divided into eight chapters — largely lays blame for the Jan. 6 attack at the feet of the 45th president and downplays security and intelligence failures.\n\nChapter 1 is titled, ""THE BIG LIE,"" a nod to Trump\'s widespread effort to delegitimize the 2020 election and falsely claim it was stolen, while Chapter 2, titled ""I JUST WANT TO FIND 11,780 VOTES,"" focuses on Trump\'s attempt to pressure state and election officials in Georgia and other places to overturn the election results.\n\nWitnesses, nearly all of them Republicans, testified that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Joe Biden’s legitimate election victory; launched a multi-pronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior members of the Justice Department and then-Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election; directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers’ counting of the electoral votes that would certify the results of the election; and refused to call off his supporters as they brutally assaulted police officers and stormed the Capitol.\n\n""Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television. ...

""He is unfit for any office.""\n\nTrump responded overnight with a series of inflammatory posts to his Truth Social network, repeating many of the same false claims about a stolen election and attacking the committee, the FBI and others.\n\n""The Government of the United States changed our Election Result, and it just doesn’t get any worse than that,"" he wrote Friday, falsely claiming that he was the true winner of the 2020 election.

TRUMP WON!!!""\n\nThe committee’s report alleges that Trump and his inner circle conducted at least 200 public or private acts of “outreach, pressure, or condemnation” targeting state and local election officials, as well as state legislators, to overturn the results between Trump’s loss in November and Jan. 6.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, phone calls or texts aimed at state or local officials; 18 public remarks targeting them; and 125 social media posts, the committee says.\n\nThe report also revealed more details about the fake elector plan, which the committee alleges Trump embraced when it became clear that state officials in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and other key battlegrounds would not overturn the results in their states and replace Biden electors with Trump electors.\n\nWhile the committee referred conservative attorney John Eastman to the Justice Department on Monday for his role in the scheme to pressure Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6, the report identifies Trump-allied lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as central to conceptualizing the plot.\n\nSome of the committee\'s conclusions appear in the report\'s appendices. For example, previous reporting and Jan. 6 hearings had revealed that Pentagon bureaucrats, including Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt and Gen. Charles Flynn, had delayed sending National Guard troops as police were overwhelmed by the rioters.\n\nBut the committee found that there was no deliberate attempt to stall the troops: “While the delay seems unnecessary and unacceptable, it was the byproduct of military processes, institutional caution, and a revised deployment approval process,"" the committee writes in Appendix 2.\n\n""We have no evidence that the delay was intentional.”\n\nAs it was tasked to do, the committee also issued a number of recommendations to both Congress and federal agencies. The panel urged congressional committees to consider creating a “formal mechanism” to determine whether to bar Trump and others identified in the report from holding future federal or state office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which targets those who have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee also called for reforms to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to make it clear that the vice president does not have the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes, an update that is already in the works. Congress will pass such a recommendation this week as part of its omnibus spending package.\n\nIn addition, the Jan. 6 committee recommended that federal agencies undertake a “whole of government strategy” to root out and combat violent extremism, including white nationalists. And it urged law enforcement to designate future certifications of presidential elections as a “national special security event.” That would require greater planning, coordination and security for future Jan. 6 certification events at the Capitol.\n\n""Driven by our investigative findings, these recommendations will help strengthen the guardrails of our democracy,"" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe report marks the culmination of a sweeping congressional investigation that included 11 public hearings, more than 100 subpoenas, more than 1,200 witness interviews and the collection of hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails and other documents.\n\nThe committee has already begun releasing dozens of transcripts from witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights, including Trump associates Eastman, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and Jeffrey Clark.\n\nOn Thursday, the Jan. 6 panel released transcripts of the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who had testified that Trump was aware the mob was armed when he sent it to the Capitol and that he had tried to join his supporters there.\n\nIn the coming days, the committee also plans to release other transcripts from interviews and depositions, as well as video and other documents and records.\n\nBecause House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., created it as a ""select"" committee, the panel expires at the end of the year. Republicans, who will take control of the House in January, have no plans to renew it.\n\nAt her final news conference as speaker Thursday, Pelosi praised Thompson, Cheney and the other Jan. 6 members for their ""persistent, patriotic leadership.""\n\n""The 117th Congress began with a violent assault on our democracy, and now we hear its conclusions,"" she said. ""We have a vital road map ensuring justice will be done ... and that this won’t happen again.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/jan-6-final-report-findings/', 'Headline': 'Key findings from the Jan. 6 committee’s final report', 'Snippet': 'Here are early takeaways about its new details and final conclusions. ... Shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, ... The scale of the investigation was massive, and many ...', 'Full_text': '1. ‘Potus im sure is loving this’: Mid-riot text adds to suggestions of Trump’s approval\n\nThe committee has focused extensively on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction as the riot was taking place. But it has occasionally suggested that he might have approved of what was happening or at least seen some political upside in it.\n\nAnd the final report contains more grist for that mill: One of the most striking new revelations is a text message from a Trump aide, Robert Gabriel. At 2:49 p.m., as the Capitol was under siege, Gabriel texted, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\nThe text builds upon previously known evidence.\n\nShortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during the riot, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nWhite House aide Sarah Matthews has said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her that Trump resisted calling on the rioters to be “peaceful” in a tweet. (In texts from the time and in later testimony to the committee, Trump aide Hope Hicks also said that, before Jan. 6, both she and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann called for Trump to preemptively urge peacefulness, but that Trump “refused.”)\n\nWhite House aide Cassidy Hutchinson has also testified that, amid a frantic effort to get Trump to act, she overheard chief of staff Mark Meadows telling White House counsel Pat Cipollone, “He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat.”\n\nThe committee pressed Cipollone on whether Trump actually wanted people to leave the Capitol. Cipollone had said he couldn’t think of anyone on staff who didn’t want the rioters to leave. But when asked whether Trump shared in that opinion, Cipollone struggled with the question and ultimately punted, saying he couldn’t “reveal communications” with Trump, citing executive privilege.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. New details on the ‘fake elector’ plot\n\nOne of the committee’s criminal referrals hones in on the effort to appoint alternate Trump electors (also known as “fake electors”) in key states. And a key question has been: What was the intent behind their appointment?\n\nThe Trump campaign pitched these electors as just a contingency — i.e., they needed to be in place by the Dec. 14 deadline, just in case a given state changed course and declared Trump the winner of their electoral votes. But there has been evidence that some of the architects of the plot planned to deploy the electors regardless, in a much more desperate and forceful ploy to overturn legitimate election results.\n\nSome of the fake electors were apparently concerned about the strategy, or even saw something unsavory ahead. In newly revealed evidence, Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt texted his party’s executive director in late November and said, “I hope they are not planning on asking us to do anything like try and say we are only the proper electors.” He added on Dec. 12 after receiving a message about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: “These guys are up to no good and its gonna fail miserably.” Hitt signed on as a Trump elector anyway.\n\nOther electors clearly worried about legal liability, insisting (in New Mexico and Pennsylvania) that the documents listing them specify that they were only legitimate if their states’ election results were overturned. But most documents made no such distinction.\n\nThe committee also detailed new evidence linking Giuliani, Trump and Meadows to the early fake-elector effort. Trump campaign lawyer Joshua Findlay testified that “it was my understanding that the President made” the decision to have someone look into the feasibility of appointing alternative electors around Dec. 7 or 8.\n\n3. Some notable recommendations — including on 14th Amendment\n\nOn Monday, the committee took the historic step of referring Trump and others to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But the report features some other recommendations, including one that had been floated after Jan. 6: possibly disqualifying Trump and others from holding office.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution says that anyone who has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States can be barred from holding office. (This law has been invoked in unsuccessful efforts to bar some GOP lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from office.)\n\nTrump’s second impeachment featured a historic number of members of the president’s own party voting in favor. And some Democrats and watchdogs continue to argue for Trump to be barred from office. But with Republicans taking over the House in early January — and even Democrats generally having shown little appetite for this step before — it appears unlikely Congress will take up this proposal.\n\nThe report also advises that congressional committees look into media and social media companies whose policies have “have had the effect of radicalizing their consumers, including by provoking people to attack their own country.” And it recommends possible safeguards against a president misusing the Insurrection Act, which some Trump allies floated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It suggests Trump defamed Dominion\n\nSome have questioned why, though Fox News and others have found themselves under legal scrutiny, Trump himself isn’t the focus of high-profile lawsuits aimed at those who spread lies and misinformation about voting machines. (Legal experts disagree on the strength of the potential legal case a plaintiff would have against him.)\n\nThe report lays out how Trump was repeatedly told what he was saying about Dominion voting machines was false, even as he continued to spout the claims. And it suggests Trump meets the test for defaming Dominion.\n\n“President Trump’s own campaign staff, administration officials, and State officials, all told him the claims had no merit. Hand recounts confirmed the fidelity of the machines,"" the report says. ""But none of this overwhelming evidence mattered. President Trump demonstrated a conscious disregard for the facts and continued to maliciously smear Dominion.”\n\nThe language here is deliberate: Legally speaking, the “actual malice” standard for defamation requires proving that the person either knew what they were saying was false or showed a reckless disregard for whether it were true.\n\nThe report highlights previously known evidence about the various advisors and government officials who either tried to dissuade Trump from this theory, or knew that others had. It also added a new name this week: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who confirmed she had tried unsuccessfully to wave Trump off the theory.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, White House press aide Sarah Matthews also testified that McEnany “actively” resisted Trump’s attempts to get her to bring up the conspiracy theory in media interviews and hold White House briefings on the subject.\n\n5. The extent of Trump’s pressure campaign in key states\n\nWe’ve known that Trump and his allies pressured lawmakers and officials far and wide to help overturn the election results in key states. But the report lays out the vast scale of this effort.\n\nIt says, “President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.”\n\nWhat qualifies as “targeting” an official is, of course, subjective. But several officials indicate they felt the pressure.\n\nThen-Michigan state House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said he received between five and 10 phone calls from Trump after the election. Chatfield said he repeatedly informed Trump he had seen nothing that would overturn Trump’s nearly three-point deficit in the state, and he and state Senate President Mike Shirkey (R) put out a statement saying as much after a meeting with Trump.\n\nBut the Trump campaign on Jan. 3 tweeted that people should contact Chatfield or the GOP leader of the state Senate, Mike Shirkey, to “Demand [a] vote on decertification."" Trump’s social media team promoted Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey said he received 4,000 text messages. Chatfield testified, ""I and my family have received numerous threats, along with members on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe report details dozens of officials who were threatened, though not all were targeted by Trump personally. The chairman of the Maricopa County, Ariz., board of supervisors, Clint Hickman (R), said “the threats never abated.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Little focus on security issues, while mostly blaming Trump\n\nThe Washington Post reported in November that some committee members and staffers on the Jan. 6 committee were upset that Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wanted the report to focus so extensively on Trump. Well, the final product appears to reflect Cheney’s desires.\n\nThe report says relatively little about the security failures that had been the focus of some congressional probing. It mostly relegates those findings to the first appendix — about 30 pages long — near the end of the report. For example, it does little to reconcile conflicting timelines presented by key officials when it comes to when the National Guard was requested and approved.\n\nBut the verdict is rather damning, saying these failures also put lives in danger.\n\nThe report says that, before Jan. 6, both federal and local law enforcement had intelligence predicting violence that day. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.” the report says. “The failure to sufficiently share and act upon that intelligence jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\nIn the next breath, though, the report emphasizes Trump’s culpability and says that better planning might not have been able to account for the violence he would stoke.\n\n7. The full picture of an allegedly corrupt plot\n\nThe chief alleged crime the committee has focused on is what’s known as obstruction of an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’s counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. And showing that requires proving Trump acted corruptly.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth running through all the evidence — most of it previously established, but some new — that this plot was corrupt. The committee has keyed on a few things: that Trump was told his voter-fraud theories were false, that he actually knew he had lost the 2020 election, and that the participants in the plot knew it was illegal.\n\nIn addition to the previously-known figures who said they pushed back on Trump’s theories internally, the committee revealed this week that White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien testified about a Dec. 18 Oval Office phone call in which he said that there was no evidence of fraud using voting machines or foreign interference. Cipollone also testified that the lack of sufficient evidence was made clear internally “over and over again.”\n\nIncluding an official in Raffensperger’s office, the report details at least eight officials testifying that Trump and his team were informed his theories were false.\n\nAs for Trump admitting he lost: Hutchinson and another former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin have both said they heard about Trump doing so. And in a transcript released this week, Hutchinson said she asked Meadows, point blank, whether Trump knew he lost. According to Hutchinson, Meadows “said something to the effect of, ‘he knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There’s a chance he didn’t lose. I want to pull this off for him.”\n\nPrevious evidence also showed some of those involved admitted their plot was illegal or might not pass legal muster. That includes contemporaneous documents from Eastman, and testimony from Pence aide Greg Jacob and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann about their interactions with Eastman, and Giuliani, respectively, who they said admitted their case would lose in court. And in October, a judge ruled that Trump had knowingly signed a verification containing false voter-fraud figures that Eastman had admitted were wrong.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. What the report doesn’t shed light on\n\nThe scale of the investigation was massive, and many witnesses weren’t particularly forthcoming, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or, in some cases, not testifying at all. That means that some of the angles probed by the committee remain unresolved or disputed. Among them:\n\n- The committee didn’t resolve what happened in the presidential vehicle after Trump’s speech. Hutchinson had testified that White House aide Anthony M. Ornato told her that Trump became irate and lunged at the head of his Secret Service detail, Bobby Engel, when Engel wouldn’t bring him to the Capitol. (She emphasized that her account was secondhand.) Ornato said he didn’t recall conveying that information to Hutchinson, according to the committee. The committee confirmed with other witnesses that Trump was angry, but they did not confirm a physical altercation. In the end, the report says it was “difficult to fully reconcile the accounts of several of the witnesses who provided information with what we heard from Engel and Ornato.”\n\n- Some congressional Democrats suggested shortly after Jan. 6 that certain Republicans provided reconnaissance tours to rioters before Jan. 6. And more specifically, the committee raised questions about a tour Rep. Barry Loudermilk(R-Ga.) led on Jan. 5, which Loudermilk struggled to explain. But the report doesn’t dwell upon this at all. It merely mentions that one of Loudermilk’s guests who was captured on video at Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 “took pictures of hallways and staircases,” which was previously known.\n\n- Hutchinson testified that Trump was told people at his speech were found with weapons but was unconcerned — and even asked that security stop using magnetometers. This is a key piece of evidence, since Trump would later direct these people to the Capitol. Hutchinson said Trump justified his lack of concern by saying, “They’re not here to hurt me.” The report doesn’t confirm that Trump was told about the weapons, but it does say Engel recalled Trump making a similar comment, as Trump was trying to persuade Engel to take him to the Capitol.\n\ncorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated that it had been more than a century since the 14th Amendment was used to bar someone from public office. In September, a New Mexico judge used it to disqualify an Otero County commissioner.

The releases have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – and new details about what key witnesses told the panel.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures:\n\nTrump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ days after 2020 election, emails show\n\nThen-President Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase “Rigged Election!” days after Election Day in 2020, according to emails provided by Jared Kushner to the House select committee.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, then-Trump aide Dan Scavino emailed Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with the request from Trump.\n\n“Hey Jared! POTUS wants to trademark/own rights to below, I don’t know who to see – or ask…I don’t know who to take to,” the email from Scavino reads, according to a transcript of Kushner’s testimony to the committee, which was released by the panel on Friday.\n\nTwo phrases were bolded in the email: “Save America PAC!” and “Rigged Election!”\n\nKushner forwarded the request and discussed it on an email chain that included Eric Trump, the president’s son; Alex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer; Sean Dollman, the chief financial officer of Trump’s 2020 campaign; and Justin Clark, a Trump campaign lawyer.\n\n“Guys - can we do ASAP please?” Kushner wrote.\n\nEric Trump responded, saying: “Both web URLs are already registered. Save America PAC was registered October 23 of this year. Was that done by the campaign?”\n\nDollman responded: “‘Save America PAC’ is already taken/registered, just confirming that. But we can still file for ‘Save America.’”\n\nKushner’s response, according to the transcript, was: “Go.”\n\nGiuliani explains Trump team pivot to state legislatures\n\nA feeling that courts weren’t comfortable with Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election drove the Trump team’s pivot to state legislatures, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the select committee earlier this year.\n\nThe theory that the US Constitution lets state legislatures intervene in the presidential election results first came up within the week after the election, Giuliani told congressional investigators. But he and then-fellow Trump attorney Jenna Ellis looked more closely at the idea when the lawsuits challenging the results weren’t getting traction.\n\n“We just got a bad feeling that these judges didn’t – they didn’t want to hear witnesses, citizens, American citizens, and that if American citizens could get up and testify, there were so many of them that it would make a very big difference,” Giuliani said in his May deposition.\n\nThe theory that a state legislature could override the results of a state’s presidential vote is considered a fringe one, and Congress recently enacted statutory changes to limit legislatures’ ability to do so.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani said, “It seemed to me the courts didn’t want to be involved in a political question like this. And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this. And we started reading the Constitution.”\n\nGinni Thomas explains why she was ‘disgusted’ with Pence in text sent days after January 6\n\nVirginia “Ginni” Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the committee that when she said she was “disgusted” with then-Vice President Mike Pence in a text on January 10, 2021, she wasn’t referring to his refusal to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s win, but rather to her frustration with him not talking up election fraud claims. There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n“I was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,” Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. “And I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.”\n\n“I wasn’t focused on the Vice President’s role on January 6th,” she said, when asked specifically if the text – previously reported by CNN – was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n“I can’t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,” she said, pointing instead to what she heard from “friends on the ground” and “grassroots activists” who had “found things suspicious” at polling places.\n\n“I don’t know specific instances,” she said. “But certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.”\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas’ interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court – an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n“He first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,” she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n“I regret the tone and content of these texts … I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,” Thomas said.\n\nThomas’ mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows’ texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n“It was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,” she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “Some of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I’m regretting that they became public … Certainly I didn’t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.”\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her “post-election activities” after Trump lost in 2020 were “minimal and mainstream.”\n\n“Her minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,” attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. “Beyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.”\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn’t recall details, citing ‘fog of war’\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee’s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn’t recall details from January 6, amid what he called “the fog of war” during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day – another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn’t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn’t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n“I’ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn’t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very – a very chaotic day, so I don’t recall those specific details,” Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn’t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato’s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was “shocked” by her testimony.\n\n“I was called to put it on,” Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson’s televised testimony, “and I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, ‘What is she talking about?’”\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump’s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn’t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump’s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato’s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump’s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel’s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n“Many of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don’t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it’s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,” Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to “champion” Trump’s election fraud claims, saying: “Just give me five dead voters.” And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of “what the data actually says.” Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee’s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ’s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she “took it upon” herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by “friends” not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials – including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House.

Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia’s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/22/jan-6-committee-report-transcripts-live-updates/', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 final report released: Committee puts blame on Trump - The ...', 'Snippet': 'Jared Kushner, former president Donald Trump’s son-in-law, was intimately involved in post-election fundraising, according to the report from the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack.', 'Full_text': ""The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol released its final 845-page report Thursday, the culmination of an exhaustive 18-month investigation into the violent insurrection and President Donald Trump’s role inciting it.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nHere's what to know:\n\n“The central cause of January 6th was one man,” the report’s authors wrote, adding that “none of the events … would have happened without” Trump.

Greene and Gaetz, widely viewed as two of the most far-right members of Congress, have shown sympathy for many of the rioters and have attempted to visit the D.C. jail where some riot defendants are being held, to inspect conditions at the facility. Gaetz notably spread a conspiracy theory on the House floor just hours after the attack, claiming that some of the rioters may have been “antifa terrorists.” Greene, meanwhile, has recently compared the riot at the Capitol to the Declaration of Independence, saying it was an attempt to “overthrow tyrants.”\n\nTangent\n\nAs time passes, right-wing condemnation of the attack has gradually been replaced by conspiracy theories. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News prime-time host who anchors the most popular show on cable news, released a three-part series in October called “Patriot Purge.” The series repeated the baseless claim that the January 6 attack was a “false flag” operation actually orchestrated by the government—a notion that has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Calls Off Press Conference On Capitol Attack Anniversary (Forbes)'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6186037/matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-maga-house-republicans/', 'Headline': 'The MAGA Squad Is Building Power to Control the GOP Congress', 'Snippet': 'Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene and most hard-core, pro-Trump House Republicans have spent the past year building leverage and clout. ...

The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day.', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}}",92.0,1

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/12/21/house-gop-report-faults-nancy-pelosi-for-jan-6-security-failures/', 'Headline': 'House GOP report faults Nancy Pelosi for Jan. 6 security failures', 'Snippet': 'House Republicans released a report which blamed Nancy Pelosi for the lack of security on Jan. 6. ... including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and ...', 'Full_text': 'House Republicans issued a scathing report Wednesday exposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s key role in the catastrophic security and intelligence failures that left the US Capitol vulnerable to a violent attack on January 6, 2021.\n\nDays after Pelosi’s Jan. 6 select committee recommended insurrection charges against former president Donald Trump over the Capitol riot, Republicans have hit back with a counter-investigation apportioning blame for the internal security breakdown on Jan. 6 to Pelosi and a dysfunctional Capitol Police intelligence division.\n\n“Leadership and law enforcement failures within the U.S. Capitol left the complex vulnerable on January 6, 2021,” says the report, which is based on a trove of texts and email messages, and testimony from Capitol Police leaders and rank-and-file officers.\n\nHouse Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, who answered to Pelosi as one of three voting members of the Capitol Police Board, “succumbed to political pressures from the Office of Speaker Pelosi and House Democrat leadership,” was “compromised by politics and did not adequately prepare for violence at the Capitol.”\n\nPelosi and her staff “coordinated closely” with Irving on security plans for the Joint Session of Congress on Jan. 6, but Republicans were deliberately left out of “important discussions related to security.”\n\nAnd, in an apparent attempt to hide from Republicans the fact that they were being excluded from discussions, Irving asked a senior Democratic staffer to “act surprised” when he sent “key information about plans for the Joint Session on Jan. 6, 2021, to him and his Republican counterpart.”\n\nThe staffer replied sardonically: “I’m startled!”\n\nThe report also claims that “staff within the House Sergeant at Arms office emailed Paul Irving that January 6th was Pelosi’s fault,” although it provides no evidence for the assertion.\n\nWhen Irving was forced to resign after the riot, an email from an unnamed staffer in his office criticized Pelosi’s “knee-jerk reaction to yesterday’s unprecedented event” and described his resignation as “spectacularly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted. This is not your fault. Or [Capitol Police chief Steven] Sund’s fault.”\n\nThe Republicans responsible for the withering report — Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Troy Nehls (R-TX) — are the five congressmen originally nominated to sit on the Jan. 6 committee, until Pelosi vetoed Banks and Jordan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the rest of his nominees in protest. Pelosi then installed two Never Trump Republican outcasts, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nGiven Pelosi’s assiduous grooming of Cheney, no doubt it suited both their interests to focus the final Jan.6 committee report on Trump — and not on Pelosi’s culpability.\n\nBut now the Republicans Pelosi rejected have skewered her in their rival report, dredging up some of what she tried to hide, despite complaining of obstruction from the personnel she controls.\n\nThe report insinuates that the Speaker left the Capitol Police without backup on Jan. 6 because “widespread concern from Democratic leadership over ‘optics’ in the aftermath of the Summer 2020 ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard.”\n\nChief Sund begged repeatedly for troops but has testified that Irving rebuffed him over concern about “optics.” During the violence on Jan. 6, Sund repeated his request, but help was delayed until after the riot ended, because Irving needed to run it up the chain of command, a.k.a. Pelosi.\n\n“The Speaker’s office was heavily involved in planning and decision-making before and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and micromanaged the Sergeant at Arms.”\n\nFrom early December 2020, Pelosi aides attended regular meetings with Irving and Sund to discuss the security plan. So hands-on was Pelosi’s chief of staff Terri McCullough that, at one point, she was editing details of parking, event timing and “language regarding official business visitors” for the Joint Session.\n\nTo illustrate the intense involvement of Pelosi’s office, on Jan. 6 alone, the report records 36 communications between Irving and Pelosi staffers, including 11 with McCullough, and 20 with Jamie Fleet, a Pelosi aide who doubled as a Democratic staff director.\n\nPelosi’s repeated assertions that she has “no power over the Capitol Police” are rejected.\n\n“This is false,” says the report. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff . . .\n\n“House Rules dictate . . . that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”\n\nIndeed, the report says that Pelosi regularly exercised her authority over security matters, “when she directed the use of magnetometers outside the House chamber in the name of safety . . . Similarly, she required masks in the House chamber [and] exerted influence on security protocols at the Capitol related to the perimeter fence . . . She also oversaw the fencing that was erected for a purported rally on September 18, 2021, that never materialized.”\n\nThe report of the Republican refuseniks is an appetizer to potential future investigations next year when they regain subpoena power. It makes sensible recommendations to prevent another disaster, including reform and oversight of the Capitol Police Board.\n\nFar from being a revenge ploy, it identifies security flaws it claims have not been remedied, including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and hopelessly outnumbered when “criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with … the Joint Session of Congress.”\n\nThe Capitol Police Intelligence Division “failed to warn USCP leadership and line officers about the threat of violence,” despite having “obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence.”\n\nIn fact, the final intelligence threat assessment three days before the riot did warn of a violent scenario in which “Congress itself” could be attacked by armed Trump supporters. But the warning was buried towards the end of the 15-page document and was not included in the up-front summary, so was overlooked. Nor was the warning mentioned in three subsequent daily intelligence reports.\n\nThe Republicans blame much of the intelligence failure on the assistant director of the USCP intelligence division, Julie Farnam, who had joined the Capitol Police from the Department of Homeland Security only 10 weeks before the riot.\n\nAnalysts testified that “the section became ‘nonfunctional’ immediately upon Farnam’s arrival as she tried to “consolidate power for herself to the detriment of the safety and security of the Capitol.”\n\n“Documents and testimony show that, immediately upon joining the USCP, and without time to acclimate, Farnam began to dismantle the systems that had kept the Capitol safe for so long,” the report alleges.\n\n“Information about planned protests and threats of violence were siloed and not properly analyzed and disseminated during this key period because of Farnam’s misplaced priorities.”\n\nOne analyst testified: “at the time of January 6, we were not doing proactive searches of social media like we had been before. We were strictly reactive.”\n\nAs a result, USCP leadership “were not fully informed about the severity of the threats against the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021”.\n\nHowever, Farnam told CBS this year that her team does not bear any responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and provided adequate threat assessments to police leadership before the riot.\n\n“I think we did an excellent job . . . I am the one who has worked tirelessly . . . to right this ship.”\n\nAfter cataloguing so many tragic failures, the report concludes on a poignant note with messages to Irving from friends in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.\n\n“You’re quite something to take this one for the team, Paul, as they say. I know how these things work and you know I do, too.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-counter-report-jan-6-security-failures-capitol', 'Headline': 'House Republicans release counter report on Jan. 6 security failures at ...', 'Snippet': ""House Republicans have released a counter-report to the Jan. 6 committee's findings identifying security failures at the U.S. Capitol before the riot began."", 'Full_text': 'Ahead of the House January 6 committee\'s final report, the five Republicans who were originally nominated to sit on the select committee on Wednesday released a counter-report on security failures at the Capitol, which they said ""the Democrat-led investigation has thus far ignored.""\n\nReps.

It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 ""caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective"" during the mob violence.\n\nRepublicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being ""compromised by politics,"" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the ""optics"" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\n\n""To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,"" the report said. ""One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.""\n\nRepublicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.\n\nDEMOCRATS RELEASE REPORT ON TRUMP TAX RETURNS, REVEALING INCOME, TAXES PAID, IRS AUDIT\n\nThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness.\n\n""The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board’s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,"" the Senate report found.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot.\n\nThe Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have for months alleged that the ""insurrection"" mounted by former President Trump\'s supporters was the final step in his plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNAACP PRESIDENT TWEETS ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS ‘DONALD TRUMP IN HANDCUFFS’\n\nThe committee released a 154-page executive summary of their findings on Monday and referred criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department.\n\n""What Donald Trump proceeded to do after the 2020 election is something no president had done before in our country,"" said Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""In a staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy.""\n\nThe panel argued during the committee\'s final meeting that Trump\'s conduct before and after Jan. 6 was ""unlawful."" Lawmakers say they have sufficient evidence that Trump obstructed an official proceeding of Congress, conspired to defraud the federal government, made a false statement, and incited, assisted or aided an insurrection.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver its 18-month tenure, the committee obtained access to tens of thousands of documents and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews related to the Capitol protests.\n\nRead the GOP report:'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/j6-committee-failed-to-preserve-records-has-no-data-on-capitol-hill-security-failures-gop-charges', 'Headline': 'J6 Committee failed to preserve records, has no data on Capitol Hill ...', 'Snippet': 'The GOP head of the committee investigating the security failures of January 6 says the Nancy Pelosi-created committee did not preserve the documents as it was required.', 'Full_text': 'FIRST ON FOX: The House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 failed to adequately preserve documents, data and video depositions – including communications it had with the Biden White House that are still missing – according to the Republican lawmaker overseeing the GOP investigation into the committee\'s work.\n\nThe now-disbanded ""J6"" committee, which was run by Democrats and included only two GOP members, has also failed to provide any evidence that it looked into Capitol Hill security failures on the day of the riot, Rep.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-capitol-police-chief-officials-concerns-optics-led-jan-6-security-failures', 'Headline': ""Former Capitol Police chief says officials' concerns about 'optics' led ..."", 'Snippet': 'Sund said he requested heightened security a number of times in the days before January 6.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “I don't know if you had been approached about the Virginia National Guard … but I still think you probably need the OK of the federal government in order to come into another jurisdiction.\n\n“Oh, my God, they're just breaking windows or doing all kinds of — it's really that somebody, they said somebody was shot,” she continued. “It's just horrendous, and all at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer urged Rosen to get Trump to put out a statement calling off the mob.\n\n“Why don't you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility?” Schumer asked. “A public statement that they should all leave.”\n\n“They're breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.

In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.businessinsider.nl/pelosi-likely-has-the-largest-security-detail-of-any-lawmaker-in-congress-heres-what-we-know-about-their-protection/', 'Headline': 'Pelosi likely has the largest security detail of any lawmaker in ...', 'Snippet': ""Which, extrapolated out, would mean Pelosi's protective force is likely to be even higher today, particularly since she was personally targeted by MAGA supporters during the January 6 attack."", 'Full_text': 'US Capitol Police are investigating Friday\'s brutal attack on congressional spouse Paul Pelosi.\n\nDetails about congressional security practices remain closely guarded after the January 6 attack.\n\nLate GOP Sen.

Similar media reports say that full-time congressional security details are limited to the speaker, House and Senate majority and minority leaders, and House and Senate whips.\n\nHeightened security concerns abound\n\nAxios reported earlier this year on the hundreds of thousands in campaign funds lawmakers spent on personal security in 2021 as threats to lawmakers rise.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia led the pack of security-seeking officials with more than $600,000 in payments. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas followed with more than $360,000 in private security costs.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York reported spending more than $83,000 on private security. Last month she told The New York Times that she\'d spent more than $120,000 on private security over the past year. And that\'s on top of the added security US Capitol Police afforded her because of all the threats her staff fields on a day-to-day basis.\n\nParty leaders reportedly told Ocasio-Cortez that she\'s one of the most threatened lawmakers in Congress, alongside Pelosi and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nFinancial records filed by the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund PAC show that the fundraising committee paid nearly $4,000 to private security firm Safehouse Security Solutions this spring.\n\nPelosi\'s office did not respond to requests for comment about any outside security arrangements the speaker has used in the past or might be employing right now.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nDit artikel is oorspronkelijk verschenen op z24.nl'}}",80.78571428571429,1

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/61075086', 'Headline': ""Biden sets rule banning sale of untraceable DIY 'ghost gun' kits - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden\'s administration has finalised a set of new regulations targeting untraceable ""ghost guns"".

Background checks have not previously been required to purchase the assembly kits.\n\nThe new rules require self-assembled ""buy build shoot"" kits to have serial numbers - legally making them a firearm.\n\n""You buy a couch [that] you have to assemble, it\'s still a couch,"" said Mr Biden said in his news conference.\n\n""You buy the parts you need to build a functioning firearm, it\'s still a gun.""\n\nIt also forces federally licensed firearm dealers to add serial numbers to any untraceable guns purchased through them.\n\nExperts say that a fraction of violent crimes are being committed with ghost guns, but law enforcement authorities say they are being recovered more frequently at crime scenes.\n\nIn 2021, there were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns recovered by police and reported to the ATF - a tenfold increase from 2016, according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, the firearms business has seen record sales since the early days of the pandemic two years ago. In 2020, a record of about 22m guns were legally sold. Almost 19m guns were bought in 2021.\n\nAlso on Monday, Mr Biden announced a new nominee for the ATF after his first choice failed to advance through the Senate confirmation process because of Republican opposition.\n\nIf confirmed, former US attorney for Ohio Steve Dettlebach will be the first to hold the office since 2013.\n\nA bullseye for Biden or a misfire?\n\nGun control is an issue Democrats in Washington always talk about but seldom are able to do much about. Part of this is the reality of congressional gridlock, which allows Republicans in the US Senate to block any substantive legislation on the topic. There is also a fear among Democrats that guns are an electoral liability. They worry that firearm-rights activists are more likely to punish them for new legislation than gun-control proponents are to reward them.\n\nAnd so Democratic-backed changes, at least on the national level, are made on the margins. Such is the case with the administration move to regulate ghost guns, which at the moment play a relatively small part in the rise of US gun violence.\n\nIt is an area, however, where the Biden administration can act on its own, without congressional support. The president can tout an accomplishment that may placate supporters concerned that gun control has languished on the back-burner during the first half of his presidency.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'Reporting from Washington.

Today, the President is nominating Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of ATF.\n\nDettelbach is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney and career prosecutor who spent over two decades as a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. He has received bipartisan praise and support from law enforcement for his work. In 2009, he was unanimously confirmed for his position as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. He has a proven track record of working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to fight violent crime and combat domestic violent extremism and religious violence – including through partnerships with the ATF to prosecute complex cases and take down violent criminal gangs. Dettelbach also worked closely with local law enforcement and community leaders to develop and implement data-driven and neighborhood-based efforts to prevent and fight violent crime. His leadership and his record of innovation in fighting crime and violence make him ready from day one to aggressively and creatively address these pressing issues at the Director of ATF.\n\nCracking down on ghost guns – the weapon of choice for many violent criminals\n\nToday, the President and Deputy Attorney General will also announce that the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of “ghost guns” – unserialized, privately-made firearms that law enforcement are increasingly recovering at crime scenes in cities across the country. Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to ATF as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a ten-fold increase from 2016.[1] Because ghost guns lack the serial numbers marked on other firearms, law enforcement has an exceedingly difficult time tracing a ghost gun found at a crime scene back to an individual purchaser.\n\nThis final rule bans the business of manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns, such as unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that individuals can buy online or at a store without a background check and can readily assemble into a working firearm in as little as 30 minutes with equipment they have at home. This rule clarifies that these kits qualify as “firearms” under the Gun Control Act, and that commercial manufacturers of such kits must therefore become licensed and include serial numbers on the kits’ frame or receiver, and commercial sellers of these kits must become federally licensed and run background checks prior to a sale – just like they have to do with other commercially-made firearms.\n\nThe final rule will also help turn some ghost guns already in circulation into serialized firearms. Through this rule, the Justice Department is requiring federally licensed dealers and gunsmiths taking any unserialized firearm into inventory to serialize that weapon. For example, if an individual builds a firearm at home and then sells it to a pawn broker or another federally licensed dealer, that dealer must put a serial number on the weapon before selling it to a customer. This requirement will apply regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts, kits, or by 3D-printers.\n\nThis rule builds on the Biden Administration’s prior executive action to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which is training a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminating investigation and prosecution tool to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes. As President Biden said during an event at the New York Police Department headquarters, if you use a ghost gun to commit a crime “not only are state and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect federal charges and federal prosecution as well.”\n\nAdditional executive action to reduce gun violence\n\nToday’s final rule includes two additional actions to make our communities safer.\n\nFirst, the final rule ensures that firearms with split receivers are subject to regulations requiring serial numbers and background checks when purchased from a licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer. Decades ago, ATF issued a regulation defining the “frame or receiver” of a firearm as the part that is regulated by the Gun Control Act – meaning that is the part that triggers federal serialization, background check, and other requirements. At that time, many firearms in the United States were single-framed firearms, like revolvers, that house key components in a single structure. However, we have seen the increasing popularity of firearms using split or multi-part receivers that house key components in multiple structures. Some courts have recently interpreted decades-old regulatory text in a way that, if broadly applied, could mean that as many as 90 percent of firearms in the United States today would not have a frame or receiver subject to federal regulation. The final rule updates the regulatory definitions of “frame” and “receiver” to ensure that firearms using split or multi-part receivers continue to be covered by our common-sense gun laws.\n\nSecond, the final rule requires federally licensed firearms dealers to retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity. At that time, these dealers must transfer the records to ATF, just as they are currently required to do at the end of licensed activity. Previously, these dealers were permitted to destroy most records after 20 years, making it harder for law enforcement to trace firearms found at crime scenes. According to ATF’s National Tracing Center, on average more than 1,300 firearms a year are untraceable because the federally licensed firearms dealer destroyed the relevant records that were more than 20 years old.\n\nImplementing the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy\n\nThis final rule is part of the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy. President Biden made more progress on executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other President during their first year in office. You can read more about the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to reduce gun crime here.\n\nPresident Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget calls on Congress to deliver the funding needed to implement the President’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make our communities safer. These additional resources will fund accountable policing, including by putting more police officers on the beat, and making essential investments in crime prevention and community violence intervention.\n\nCongress needs to do its job by passing this budget and other essential legislation to reduce gun crime, including legislation to require background checks for all gun sales, ensure that no terrorist can buy a weapon in the United States, ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms — ghost guns, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repeal gun manufacturers’ protection from liability.\n\n###'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'In 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides ...', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-administration-proposes-eliminating-gun-show-loophole-regulation-rcna102800', 'Headline': ""Biden administration proposes regulation to eliminate 'gun show loophole'"", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms in years.\n\nThe administration said that new language in a law passed last year by Congress after the Uvalde school shooting is empowering it to take the action, though Second Amendment activists are likely to challenge the move in court.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is proposing a regulation that would essentially say that anyone who deals in firearms for profit must get a federal license — and conduct criminal background checks — regardless of whether they sell the guns in brick-and-mortar stores, gun shows, flea markets or on the internet. The new rule will go through the federal rulemaking process.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday that the move is a result of the bipartisan law passed by Congress last year.\n\n“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was passed by Congress to reduce gun violence, including by expanding the background checks that keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said. “This proposed rule implements Congress’s mandate to expand the definition of who must obtain a license and conduct a background check before selling firearms.”\n\nThe ""gun show loophole"" has been cited for years as a major hole in the federal background check system, allowing a vast number of private sales without background checks. The ATF currently licenses about 80,000 brick-and-mortar gun dealers, but gun sales are increasingly taking place outside that system, free of background checks.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signed an executive order designed to expand background checks. It directed Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, an authority an administration official said was detailed in the bipartisan gun law.\n\nNBC News reported last year about some of the provisions of the law that led to Thursday\'s proposed rule. At the time, however, sources close to the negotiations behind the legislation tempered expectations that it could close the gun show loophole or have a significant effect on the sale of guns online, although they hoped it would bolster enforcement and oversight of the firearms market.\n\nThe sources said they had in mind the shooter in Midland-Odessa, Texas, who killed eight people in 2019 with a gun that he bought through a private sale. He had previously failed a background check from a licensed gun seller and was not allowed to buy a weapon.\n\nBiden touted the bipartisan legislation in June, a year after he signed it into law, saying that it was already saving lives.\n\nThe president said the law has allowed the Justice Department to run enhanced background checks through the FBI on adults under 21 who try to buy firearms. It has also provided funding to states to expand the so-called red flag laws that allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. And it has provided money to states to boost mental health services, especially for young people. Biden also noted that the law closed the so-called boyfriend loophole by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.\n\nBiden has long made it a priority to enact policies focused on curbing gun violence. He and then-President Barack Obama attempted to push Congress to pass such measures, and the closest it came was in 2013, a few months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The Senate fell six votes short of advancing a bill by Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would have required background checks in all commercial gun sales.\n\nSince becoming president, while still pressuring Congress to pass legislation, Biden has also used his executive authority to try to reduce gun violence, although he faces limits. He has repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass another assault weapons ban in the wake of several mass shootings.\n\nThere\'s little chance of such a measure passing through both chambers of Congress. Republicans narrowly control the House, and Democrats have a thin majority in the Senate, meaning they would need substantial Republican support to overcome a filibuster.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-landmark-gun-legislation-god-willing-s-going-lot-lives-rcna35326', 'Headline': ""Biden signs landmark gun legislation: 'God willing, it's going to save ..."", 'Snippet': 'June 25, 2022, 6:17 AM PDT.

It will also require enhanced background checks for people ages 18 to 21 and funding for youth mental health services.\n\nThe bipartisan gun legislation sped through Congress in the month after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas.

However, to fully address this problem, Congress must act.', 'Full_text': 'In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Attorney General to move as close to universal background checks as possible within existing law. Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called “fire sale loophole.”\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to “predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole” or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.\n\n###'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/joe-biden-guns-crime/', 'Headline': 'Where Joe Biden stands on crime and guns - Washington Post', 'Snippet': 'Nov. 8 at 7:00 a.m. Joe Biden supports restricting access to guns for people who may harm themselves or others, and he supports requiring expanded background checks.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives.""

The President, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has proposed a minimum nursing staff standard for facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities have died because of COVID-19.\n\n""That\'s unacceptable,"" Xavier Becerra, the secretary of HHS, told Morning Edition.\n\nRoughly three quarters of long-term care facilities would have to hire additional staff to meet the administration\'s requirements, CMS estimates.\n\n""It\'s a big change in the sense that the industry hasn\'t had to follow particular standards,"" Becerra said.

The President is committed to ensuring that all Americans, including older Americans and people with disabilities, live in a society that is accessible, inclusive, and equitable. To accomplish that goal, the Administration continues to be committed to home- and community-based services and ensuring that in no case should a health care facility be causing a patient harm. The President believes we must improve the quality of our nursing homes so that seniors, people with disabilities, and others living in nursing homes get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve. That’s why he is announcing a set of reforms—developed by and implemented through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—that will improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold nursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and facility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can make informed decisions about care.\n\nTo do this, the reforms the President is announcing will ensure that:\n\nevery nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care;\n\npoorly performing nursing homes are held accountable for improper and unsafe care and immediately improve their services or are cut off from taxpayer dollars; and\n\nthe public has better information about nursing home conditions so that they can find the best available options.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes, which are home to many of our most at-risk community members. More than 1.4 million people live in over 15,500 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes across the nation. In the past two years, more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes have died from COVID-19—nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nDespite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, sub-standard care that leads to avoidable resident harm. In fact, failure to comply with Federal guidelines at nursing homes is widespread. The Government Accountability Office found that, from 2013 to 2017, 82% of all inspected nursing homes had an infection prevention and control deficiency, including a lack of regular handwashing, that was identified through Medicare and Medicaid surveys.\n\nWithout decisive action now, these unacceptable conditions may get worse. Private equity firms have been buying up struggling nursing homes, and research shows that private equity-owned nursing homes tend to have significantly worse outcomes for residents. Private equity firms’ investment in nursing homes has ballooned from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018, with about 5% of all nursing homes now owned by private equity firms. Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people—a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a seventeen-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. That suggests an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nAnother study found that private equity-backed nursing homes’ COVID-19 infection rate and death rate were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that, despite depriving residents of quality care, private equity-owned nursing homes actually led to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps by Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) through its Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes, to protect vulnerable residents and the health care heroes who care for them, and to crack down on bad actors. The Administration is committed to these urgent actions as first steps toward fulfilling a broader commitment to ensure taxpayer dollars go toward the safe, adequate, and respectful care seniors and people with disabilities deserve—not to the pockets of predatory owners and operators who seek to maximize their profits at the expense of vulnerable residents’ health and safety.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Support Nursing Homes That Provide Safe, Adequate, and Dignified Care\n\nCMS is launching four new initiatives to ensure that residents get the quality care they need—and that taxpayers pay for. These initiatives will help ensure adequate staffing, dignity and safety in their accommodations, and quality care.\n\nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a nursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care residents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities found that increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that nursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue proposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.\n\nReduce Resident Room Crowding. Most nursing home residents prefer to have private rooms to protect their privacy and dignity, but shared rooms with one or more other residents remain the default option. These multi-occupancy rooms increase residents’ risk of contracting infectious diseases, including COVID-19. CMS will explore ways to accelerate phasing out rooms with three or more residents and to promote single-occupancy rooms.\n\nStrengthen the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Value-Based Purchasing (“VBP”) Program. The SNF-VBPprogram awards incentive funding to facilities based on quality performance. CMS has begun to measure and publish staff turnover and weekend staffing levels, metrics which closely align with the quality of care provided in a nursing home. CMS intends to propose new payment changes based on staffing adequacy, the resident experience, as well as how well facilities retain staff.\n\nReinforce Safeguards against Unnecessary Medications and Treatments. Thanks to CMS’ National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes, the nation has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes in recent years. However, inappropriate diagnoses and prescribing still occur at too many nursing homes. CMS will launch a new effort to identify problematic diagnoses and refocus efforts to continue to bring down the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.\n\nEnhancing Accountability and Oversight\n\nHolding nursing homes accountable for their performance requires a robust compliance program—a program that has adequate funding to perform inspections and that imposes meaningful penalties when deficiencies are found. Federal taxpayer dollars should not flow to nursing homes that are unsafe.\n\nAdequately Fund Inspection Activities. For over seven years, funding to conduct health and safety inspections has remained flat while the number of complaints about nursing homes has surged. To protect residents and crack down on unsafe nursing homes, President Biden will call on Congress to provide almost $500 million to CMS, a nearly 25% increase, to support health and safety inspections at nursing homes.\n\nBeef up Scrutiny on More of the Poorest Performers. CMS’s Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to “graduate” from the program. The SFF program will be overhauled to more quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when appropriate.\n\nExpand Financial Penalties and Other Enforcement Sanctions. CMS will expand the instances in which it takes enforcement actions against poor-performing facilities based on desk reviews of data submissions, which will be performed in addition to on-site inspections. In July 2021, CMS rescinded a Trump Administration change that lowered penalty amounts on bad actor nursing homes for harmful deficiencies by imposing only a one-time fine, instead of more aggressive per-day fines that charge for each day a facility is out of compliance. CMS will now explore making such per-day penalties the default penalty for non-compliance. CMS will also use data, predictive analytics, and other information processing tools to improve enforcement. President Biden is also calling on Congress to raise the dollar limit on per-instance financial penalties levied on poor-performing facilities, from $21,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nIncrease Accountability for Chain Owners of Substandard Facilities. President Biden is calling on Congress to give CMS new authority to require minimum corporate competency to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, enabling CMS to prohibit an individual or entity from obtaining a Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement for a nursing home (new or existing) based on the Medicare compliance history of their other owned or operated facilities (previous or existing). He is further calling on Congress to expand CMS enforcement authority at the ownership level, enabling CMS to impose enforcement actions on the owners and operators of facilities even after they close a facility, as well as on owners or operators that provide persistent substandard and noncompliant care in some facilities, while still owning others.\n\nProvide Technical Assistance to Nursing Homes to Help them Improve. CMS currently contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations that help providers across the health care spectrum make meaningful quality of care improvements. CMS will ensure that improving nursing home care is a core mission for these organizations and will explore pathways to expand on-demand trainings and information sharing around best practices, while expanding individualized, evidence-based assistance related to issues exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nFor too long, corporate owners and operators have not been held to account for poor nursing home performance. CMS will improve the public transparency of facility ownership and safeguard nursing home residents.\n\nCreate a Database of Nursing Home Owners and Operators. CMS will create a new database that will track and identify owners and operators across states to highlight previous problems with promoting resident health and safety. This registry will use information collected through provider enrollment and health and safety inspections to provide more information about prospective owners and operators to states. Giving the public a resource to better understand owners’ and operators’ previous violations will empower states to better protect the health and safety of residents.\n\nImprove Transparency of Facility Ownership and Finances. CMS will implement Affordable Care Act requirements regarding transparency in corporate ownership of nursing homes, including by collecting and publicly reporting more robust corporate ownership and operating data. It will also make this information easier to find on the Nursing Home Care Compare website.\n\nEnhance Nursing Home Care Compare: CMS will implement a range of initiatives to improve Nursing Home Care Compare, the rating website designed to help families pick a facility for their loved ones. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, CMS has already published new measures on Care Compare, which allow users to consider nursing home staff turnover, weekend staffing levels, and other important factors in their decision-making process. When the new minimum staffing requirement comes online, Care Compare will also prominently display whether a facility is meeting these minimum staffing requirements. CMS will further improve Care Compare by improving the readability and usability of the information displayed—giving you and your family insight into how to interpret key metrics. Finally, CMS will ensure that ratings more closely reflect data that is verifiable, rather than self-reported, and will hold nursing homes accountable for providing inaccurate information. The President is calling on Congress to give CMS additional authority to validate data and take enforcement action against facilities that submit incorrect information.\n\nExamine the Role of Private Equity. As described above, private equity investors are playing a growing role in the nursing home sector, and published research increasingly indicates that facility ownership by investment groups leads to worse outcomes while costing taxpayers more—particularly as these owners have sought to cut expenses at the cost of patient health and safety, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS and other federal agencies will examine the role of private equity, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other investment ownership in the nursing home sector and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents’ best interests.\n\nCreating Pathways to Good-paying Jobs with the Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\n\nEnsure Nurse Aide Training is Affordable. Lowering financial barriers to nurse aide training and certification will strengthen and diversify the nursing home workforce. CMSwill establish new requirements to ensure nurse aide trainees are notified about their potential entitlement to training reimbursement upon employment. CMS will further work with states to ensure reimbursement is being distributed and that free training opportunities are widely publicized.\n\nSupport State Efforts to Improve Staffing and Workforce Sustainability. Strengthening the nursing home workforce requires adequate compensation as well as a realistic career ladder. CMS will develop a template to assist and encourage States requesting to tie Medicaid payments to clinical staff wages and benefits, including additional pay for experience and specialization.\n\nLaunch National Nursing Career Pathways Campaign. CMS, in collaboration with the Department of Labor, will work with external entities—including training intermediaries, registered apprenticeship programs, labor-management training programs, and labor unions—to conduct a robust nationwide campaign to recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into long-term care careers, with pathways into health-care careers like registered and licensed nurses.\n\nEnsuring Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness in Nursing Homes\n\nContinued COVID-19 Testing in Long-term Care Facilities. Throughout the pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided approximately 3 million tests per week to all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes and thousands more assisted living facilities, supporting outbreak testing and regular testing of staff. HHS will continue to support this key mitigation strategy for vulnerable residents and the staff that care for them.\n\nContinued COVID-19 Vaccinations and Boosters in Long-term Care Facilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has provided the full support of the federal government to states in ensuring that staff and residents across long-term care facilities have access to vaccinations and booster shots. Today, facilities are required to ensure staff are vaccinated and more than 87.1% of residents have received their primary series. CDC continues to offer all facilities the ability to be matched with a federal pharmacy partner to host an on-site vaccination clinic. CMS has reached out to thousands of these facilities directly to offer support, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has made a wide set of tools available. HHS will continue to promote access to these clinics and efforts to integrate vaccinations into routine services, incentivize vaccinations through provider quality payment programs, and continue to provide a full range of resources to continue to build confidence in the vaccine.\n\nStrengthen Requirements for On-site Infection Preventionists. CMS will clarify and increase the standards for nursing homes on the level of staffing facilities need for on-site infection prevention employees, undoing the Trump Administration’s changes to these requirements to help improve resident health and safety.\n\nEnhance Requirements for Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness. Both the pandemic and the increase in natural disasters have demonstrated how critical proactive emergency preparedness is to keeping residents of nursing homes safe. CMS is examining and considering changes to emergency preparedness requirements and is working to bolster the resiliency of the health care sector as part of an Administration-wide effort to be ready for the next pandemic and the next weather-related emergencies.\n\nIntegrate Pandemic Lessons into Nursing Home Requirements. The pandemic has underscored the need for resident-centered updates to nursing homes’ requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS will integrate new lessons on standards of care into nursing home requirements around fire safety, infection control, and other areas, using an equity lens.\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/13/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-to-increase-transparency.html', 'Headline': 'Biden-Harris Administration Continues Unprecedented Efforts to Increase ...', 'Snippet': 'Between 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership.

Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken historic actions to deliver on the President’s call to action and ensure seniors and people with disabilities get the reliable, high-quality care they deserve.\n\nToday, in a continued effort to deliver on the President’s commitment, HHS announced additional action to increase the transparency of nursing home ownership and management. The Department issued a proposed rule to require nursing homes to disclose to CMS and states additional ownership and management information. The rule also includes private equity and real estate investment trust definitions, setting the stage for the disclosure of whether nursing home owners are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. The proposal marks an important step in continuing to implement President Biden’s initiative to improve the quality and care available at nursing homes. By making facility ownership and oversight more transparent, nursing home residents and their families will be more empowered to make informed decisions about care.\n\n“President Biden has made clear: improving our nation’s nursing homes is an urgent priority, and this Administration is not afraid to take bold action to tackle this head-on,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are continuing our unprecedented efforts to increase nursing home ownership transparency – because it’s what the public deserves. We are pursuing all avenues to shine a light on this industry. We will keep doing everything we can to ensure all Americans receive the dignity, care, and respect they deserve.”\n\n“CMS is committed to using every tool at our disposal to improve nursing home care and identify trends that enhance residents’ quality of life,” CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “If finalized, this rule would strengthen our ability to examine ownership types, including private equity and real estate investment trusts.”\n\nThe proposed rule would implement portions of Section 6101(a) of the Affordable Care Act. This would require nursing homes enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid — the majority of this country’s nursing homes — to disclose additional information regarding owners, operators, and management; for example, nursing homes would disclose individuals or entities that provide administrative services or clinical consulting services to the nursing homes.\n\nNursing homes frequently use other companies to provide major services or support, but families currently have no way of knowing which different companies or firms provide care to their loved ones and how they might be connected to the owners of a nursing home. The proposed rule would also require additional information about entities that lease or sublease property to nursing homes, since the facilities and property owners may be set up as different corporate entities even though the entities work hand-in-hand.\n\nIn addition to the Section 6101(a) disclosures, the proposed rule would provide definitions of “private equity company” and “real estate investment trust” to assist nursing homes when reporting this data.\n\nThese key definitions will lead to the disclosure of whether direct and indirect nursing home owners are private equity companies or real estate investment trusts via an updated nursing home enrollment application expected to be ready for public use in the summer of 2023.Concerns about the quality of care and operations of nursing facilities owned by private equity companies and other types of investment firms have increased since 2011. Recent research has found that resident outcomes are significantly worse at private equity-owned nursing homes:\n\nA recent study found that residents in nursing homes acquired by private equity were 11.1% more likely to have a preventable emergency department visit and 8.7% more likely to experience a preventable hospitalization, when compared to residents of for-profit nursing homes not associated with private equity.\n\nOne working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities over a 17-year period found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership. Another study found that private equity-backed nursing homes had a COVID-19 infection rate and death rate that were 30% and 40% above statewide averages, respectively.\n\nResearch also suggests that private equity ownership of nursing homes may lead to an uptick in Medicare costs, too.\n\nThe additional data required to be reported under the rule would be publicly reported pursuant to section 6101(b) of the Affordable Care Act. This transparency will, among other things, allow families to make more informed choices about the care of their loved ones, and it will enable CMS and others to scrutinize more closely how ownership types correlate with care outcomes and to determine which environments are more likely to deliver better care for residents and patients.\n\nThese new data and analysis support President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of improving transparency around nursing facility ownership and improve competition of the overall industry. Greater transparency will help both the Administration and external parties better understand how the nursing home market is changing and whether the market is becoming more concentrated, which could potentially disrupt market competition and affect quality of care. For example, data analysis has shown:\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, 348 hospitals experienced a change in ownership, but 3,000 nursing homes experienced a change in ownership. The number of nursing homes sold each year has increased since 2016.\n\nThe largest 10 nursing home chains own more than 10% of nursing homes—a disproportionate share that raises concerns about market concentration.\n\nNursing homes with lower Star quality ratings are sold more often than those with higher Star quality ratings, raising concerns about the relationship between ownership changes and quality.\n\nRecently published research has found that in the 2-3 years after real estate investment trusts invest in nursing homes, registered nurse staffing levels decline by as much as 6%.\n\nToday’s proposed rule builds on the Department’s historic releases of data and unprecedented efforts to increase transparency.

""When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer.""\n\nThe proposed rules, which now enter a public comment period and would take years more to fully take effect, call for staffing equivalent to 3 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The rules also call for facilities to have an RN on staff 24 hours a day, every day.\n\nThe average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, according to government reports, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark.\n\nNEW JERSEY NURSING HOME SHOOTING LEAVES 2 DEAD, POLICE SAY\n\nStill, the government insists a majority of the country’s roughly 15,000 nursing homes, which house some 1.2 million people, would have to add staff under the proposed rules.\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, called the move ""an important first step."" CMS oversees nursing homes.\n\nA senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement, said the Biden administration was open to revisiting the staffing threshold once implemented.\n\n""I would caution anyone who thinks that the status quo – in which there is no federal floor for nursing home staffing – is preferable to the standards we’re proposing,"" said Stacy Sanders, an aide to Beccera. ""This standard would raise staffing levels for more than 75% of nursing homes, bringing more nurse aides to the bedside and ensuring every nursing home has a registered nurse on site 24/7.""\n\nThe new thresholds are drastically lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 CMS-funded study recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily.\n\nMost U.S. facilities don’t meet that threshold. Many advocates said even it was insufficient, not taking into account quality of life, simply determining the point at which residents could suffer potential harm.\n\nAfter the Democratic president elevated the issue in his State of the Union speech, advocates were initially elated, expecting the most significant change for residents since the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. That changed after a copy of a new CMS-funded study on the subject was inadvertently posted this week, claiming there is ""no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized.""\n\nAdvocates were bereft, saying they felt betrayed by administration officials they thought to be allies.

He begrudgingly acknowledged the 24/7 RN rule could bring small improvements to the worst facilities, but he otherwise was withering in his criticism.\n\nCalling the move ""heartbreaking"" and ""nauseating,"" he said it would do more harm than good, putting a government imprimatur on poorly staffed homes and imperiling wrongful-death lawsuits.\n\n""It is a tremendous dereliction of duty,"" he said. ""We are continuing to allow nursing homes to warehouse people and to rip the public off.""\n\nKatie Smith Sloan, the head LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit nursing homes, said it was meaningless to create a rule requiring facilities to hire additional staff when the industry was already in a workforce crisis and ""there are simply no people to hire.""\n\n""To say that we are disappointed that President Biden chose to move forward with the proposed staffing ratios despite clear evidence against them is an understatement,"" she said.\n\nCurrent law requires only that homes have ""sufficient"" staffing, but it leaves nearly all interpretation to states. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have their own staffing regulations. Some are so low that advocates say they’re meaningless, and, across the board, enforcement is often toothless.\n\nThe problem has long been apparent to front-line nurse aides – the low-paid, overwhelmingly female and disproportionately minority backbone of facility staffs – and to residents themselves, whose call bells go unanswered, whose showers become less frequent and who lie hungry, awaiting help with meals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 U.S. nursing home residents, brought the greatest attention to poor staffing in history.

If you ask an advocate, they'll say there's plenty of money in the system. I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.”\n\nNursing home residents represent a disproportionate share of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic, and the Biden administration has also been working to develop home- and community-based care as an alternative.\n\nThe cornerstone of Biden's nursing home plan is a new requirement for minimum staffing standards. He's ordering the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to conduct a study on staffing and publish proposed regulations within a year.\n\nExperts say staffing levels are the single most important marker for nursing home quality, and many facilities lack sufficient numbers of nurses, nursing assistants and other workers involved in providing direct care to patients. The coronavirus pandemic has led to many workers leaving the industry, even as nursing homes raised wages, so a new federal staffing requirement may take time to put into place.\n\nLawmakers in Congress have been debating legislation to require minimum staffing standards for facilities that accept payment from Medicare and Medicaid, as virtually all do. The original plan was to include staffing requirements in Biden's domestic agenda bill, but with that legislation stalled the administration seems to be shifting to using its regulatory powers to bring about changes.\n\nBiden's plan also calls for moving nursing homes toward private rooms for their residents, directing federal regulators to explore how to phase out living arrangements that house three or more residents in the same room.\n\n“Despite the tens of billions of federal taxpayer dollars flowing to nursing homes each year, too many continue to provide poor, substandard care that leads to avoidable resident harm,” said a White House policy document that outlined Biden's plan.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the major nursing home industry groups.\n\nBeefed-up oversight is another priority for Biden. His plan calls for increasing the nursing home inspection budget by $500 million, a boost of nearly 25%. Nursing home inspections are generally carried out by the states, following guidelines from Medicare. Biden is planning to revamp a special inspection program that focuses on low-performing facilities, to raise fines on nursing homes that fail to improve and, if necessary, cut off Medicare and Medicaid payments.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the problems of nursing homes, a neglected part of the health care system. More than 200,000 residents and staff of long-term care facilities have died, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. While nursing home residents and staff account for a tiny share of the U.S. population, they have accounted for more than 1 in 5 deaths.\n\nBiden's plan calls for the government to keep a focus on vaccinating and boosting nursing home residents and staff, along with regular testing. While the omicron wave saw increased cases and deaths in nursing homes, facilities were largely spared a repeat of last winter's grim experience.\n\nWith infection control considered a chronic problem at many facilities, Biden is directing Medicare to strengthen requirements that the nursing homes employ on-site infection prevention specialists.\n\nMore than half of the nation's nursing homes are owned by for-profit companies, and the administration wants to shine a spotlight on a growing trend of private equity firms snapping up ownership of facilities.\n\nThe White House said the private equity stake in the industry grew from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion by 2018.\n\n“Too often, the private equity model has put profits before people, a particularly dangerous model when it comes to the health and safety of vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities,” the White House policy document said.\n\nOfficials said federal agencies will be directed to examine the role of private equity investors in the nursing home industry “and inform the public when corporate entities are not serving their residents' best interests.”\n\nAdvocates were cheered by the White House announcement.\n\n“This plan is a major step forward for quality and safety in our nation’s nursing homes,” said Terry Fulmer, president of the nonprofit John A. Hartford Foundation, which works to improve long-term care. “It will be essential that it get implemented quickly and monitored closely for the improvements we need now.”""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/nursing-homes/info-2022/biden-nursing-home-reform.html', 'Headline': 'President Biden Proposes New Nursing Home Regulations - AARP', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden touched on the reforms during his State of the Union address on Tuesday\ufeff, saying federal officials will “set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect."" ...

These facilities have been plagued by staffing shortages for years, but they’ve gotten much worse during the pandemic and threaten resident care and infection control.\n\n“Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that all nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care and that workers have the support they need to provide high-quality care,” the White House said in a press release. “Nursing homes will be held accountable if they fail to meet this standard.”\n\nExactly what that standard looks like — or how facilities will be held accountable — are to be determined. Several aspects of Biden’s proposed nursing home reforms will need to clear public comment periods and other regulatory processes or require congressional action to take effect.\n\nBut resident advocates praised the announcement. “Not every issue gets mentioned in the State of the Union,” said Rhonda Richards, AARP’s senior legislative representative in government affairs. “It is significant that the president is talking about this. His plan will take important steps to better protect seniors in nursing homes and includes key policies that AARP has been advocating on.”\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), told AARP in an interview that she has “personally met with nursing home residents, with CNAs — with certified nursing assistants — as well as the industry and ombudsmen to really hear what is happening on the ground.”\n\n“We have an ambitious agenda,” Brooks-LaSure says. “All of the things we’re doing are really focused on helping caregivers to be able to make better decisions if nursing home care is the right decision for their loved one.”\n\nAddressing staffing shortages\n\nNursing homes have recorded nearly 1 million COVID cases among residents and more than a million cases among staffers in the past two years, according to data from the CMS, which regulates the facilities along with state survey agencies. Even for staffers with mild symptoms, a positive test usually means at least a few days away from work. Huge numbers of certified nursing assistants, who generally make little more than minimum wage, have not received a COVID-19 booster shot.\n\n“Staffing is clearly the number one issue across the long-term care spectrum. It’s huge, not just for nursing homes but for all health care facilities,” says Mark Miller, Washington, D.C.’s long-term care ombudsman and the president of the National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. “That’s going to take a long time to build up, but that\'s the most significant piece to this.”\n\nWhile COVID deaths among residents have recently declined nationally as the omicron surge has waned, staffing shortages and cases among staff spiked in the four-week period ending Jan. 23, according to an AARP analysis of CMS data. Nearly 2 in 5 U.S. nursing homes reported a staffing shortage in that window.\n\nIn some states, the shortages were more dire. In Alaska, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, more than 60 percent of facilities statewide reported a lack of staff.\n\nA growing body of research has connected short-staffed facilities with more severe COVID outbreaks, so residents are potentially at greater risk of infection when there aren’t enough nurses and other staff to go around.\n\nBut nursing home operators have long pushed back on mandatory staffing minimums, saying the real issue is that there aren’t enough interested and qualified workers to go around.\n\n“We would love to hire more nurses and nurse aides to support the increasing needs of our residents,” Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes and long-term care facilities, said in a statement. “However, we cannot meet additional staffing requirements when we can’t find people to fill the open positions, nor when we don’t have the resources to compete against other employers.”\n\nIncreasing fines, sanctions on ‘substandard facilities’\n\nThe White House proposal calls for increasing fines and penalties on facilities that fail to meet federal care standards, asking Congress to boost the limit on fines per infraction in some cases from $21,000 to $1 million.\n\nThe administration is also calling on Congress to significantly expand federal regulators’ ability to target bad actors — and to boost CMS funding by nearly 25 percent to $500 million annually for health and safety inspections of nursing homes. Under the White House proposal, regulators would be able to better track nursing home operators’ history of penalties and infractions.\n\n“When you get a Medicaid contract through CMS, they’re taken individually. It’s not like you’re looking at my past performance at other facilities that I owned,” says Miller, who also works with AARP’s Legal Counsel for the Elderly. “This is really going to shine a light on that.”\n\nAmong the White House’s other proposed nursing home reforms:\n\nA new CMS database that will make it easier to track and compare the performance of facilities owned by the same company or owner\n\nThe ability for CMS to go after owners for wrongdoing, even if an individual facility shuts down\n\nA phaseout of nursing home rooms with three or more residents in favor of single-occupancy rooms\n\nGreater oversight of residents’ diagnoses and prescriptions, with a focus on anti-psychotic drugs\n\nContinued funding and support for COVID-19 tests, vaccines and boosters in nursing homes\n\nMiller describes the White House’s plan as “the single most significant set of proposals I’ve seen in 35 years.” But he acknowledges that many of the proposals will require congressional action during a busy and contentious midterm election year. Some aspects of the proposal, like the staffing requirements, may be able to bypass Congress but will still take time to be implemented.\n\n\u200bAnd some critics argue that they don’t go far enough to address other issues like Medicaid reimbursement rates and worker compensation. “Our system of enforcement shouldn’t be based on punishment over improvement,” Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of the LeadingAge association of nonprofit aging services and nursing home providers, said in a statement.\n\nAndrew Soergel covers nursing homes and federal and state policy for AARP.

Yet they don’t address residents’ rights to have contact with informal caregivers — family members and friends who provide both emotional support and practical assistance.\n\nREAD:\n\nSeniors Find Fortitude Waning, Malaise Growing\n\nThat’s been a painful concern during the pandemic as nursing homes have locked down, caregivers have been unable to visit loved ones, and a significant number of residents have become isolated, discouraged, or depressed.\n\nThousands of residents died alone, leaving a trail of grief for those who couldn’t be by their side. Altogether, more than 200,000 residents and staffers in long-term care facilities perished of COVID-19 in the first two years of the pandemic, according to an analysis by KFF.\n\n“What we learned is that family members’ support is absolutely essential to the well-being of residents,” said Mairead Painter, Connecticut’s long-term care ombudsman. (Ombudsmen are official advocates for nursing home residents.) “We need to make sure that the far-reaching restrictions put in place never happen again.”\n\nAlthough nursing home residents have a right to have visitors under federal law, this protection was “degraded” during the pandemic, said Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. “I worry that facilities and public health departments will feel emboldened to cut visitation off at their discretion, whenever there’s an infectious disease outbreak,” he explained.\n\nWhat’s needed now, Chicotel suggested, is legislation stating that “even in a public health emergency, residents have a core right to support from [informal] caregivers that cannot be waived.”\n\nA new “essential caregivers” bill in California (AB-2546) would allow residents to designate two such informal caregivers, one of which would have access to a facility around-the-clock without advance scheduling. Caregivers would need to comply with the same safety and infection control protocols that apply to staffers. Laws with a similar intent have passed in 11 states, according to the Essential Caregivers Coalition, an advocacy group formed during the pandemic.\n\nNationally, the Essential Caregivers Act of 2021, another measure along these lines, is languishing in the House Ways and Means health subcommittee. Competing priorities, pandemic-related fatigue, and a sense that the covid emergency “is behind us” are contributing to inaction, said Maitely Weismann, a co-founder of the Essential Caregivers Coalition.\n\nIf sweeping nursing home changes don’t address the harm to residents when they are cut off from families, “we’re only halfway where we need to be,” she cautioned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment about whether it planned to address the issue.\n\nREAD:\n\nManchin Takes the Teeth Out of Democrats’ Plan for Seniors’ Dental Care\n\nElizabeth O. Stern, 69, of Stonington, Connecticut, was unable to see her 91-year-old mother for eight months after her mother’s nursing home shut its doors on March 10, 2020. Before the pandemic, Stern visited nearly every day with her mother, who had a stroke in 2016 and developed dementia.\n\n“I did her laundry and cleaned and washed the windows in her room,” Stern told me. “I took care of her fingernails and much of her personal care. I’d sing her to sleep at night.”\n\nUnable to see her family during the long pandemic-inspired lockdown, Stern’s mother became anguished, and her health deteriorated. Two and a half days before she died in November 2020, Stern was finally able to get inside the nursing home to say her final goodbyes.\n\n“So many family caregivers like me are scratching their heads and wondering why, after all the devastation we’ve suffered, are we again being overlooked in the [Biden administration’s] proposed reforms,” she said.\n\nNew research confirms the extent of assistance that family caregivers like Stern provide. Using national survey data from 2016, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania reported in a recent Health Affairs study that informal caregivers helped 91% of nursing home residents who needed aid with medications; 76% of residents who required assistance with self-care tasks such as bathing or dressing; 75% of residents who had problems such as getting in and out of bed or moving across a room; and 71% who required aid with household tasks, such as managing money. On average, this care from informal caregivers amounted to 37 hours a month.\n\nIn addition to the harmful effect on residents, the loss of this assistance during the pandemic placed extra burdens on already-stressed nursing home workers, contributing to the staffing crisis that afflicts long-term care, said Dr. Rachel Werner, co-author of the study.\n\n“The discussion we should be having is how to support [informal] caregivers in long-term care facilities, whether we’re in a pandemic or not, by acknowledging what they do, giving them more training, and making them part of care teams and the care planning process,” Werner said.\n\nMORE:\n\nSupport Service Coordinators for Older Adults\n\nRobyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy organization, added a note of caution. “One of the things we’re concerned about is that family members and the assistance they provide might be looked at, in some cases, as part of a solution to short-staffing in nursing homes,” she told me.\n\n“Yes, family members can help, and we want to make sure that their access to long-term care facilities is ensured. But they can’t be seen as a substitute for staff.”\n\nIn San Francisco, that line blurred for Dr. Teresa Palmer, a geriatrician, whose 103-year-old mother took to bed in her nursing home in March 2021 and wouldn’t get up. Concerned, Palmer insisted on a “compassionate care” exception to the nursing home’s lockdown rules and was able to see her mother inside the facility for the first time in a year.\n\n“To the staff, my mother was just an old person who was acting old. But she was down to 90 pounds from a baseline weight of 105 and her bowel functions had changed,” said Palmer, who took her mother to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with malnourishment, dehydration, and pancreatic cancer.\n\nPalmer brought her mother home from the hospital, with hospice care, where she died 10 weeks later.\n\n“Even in a very good nursing home such as my mother’s, they really don’t have time to make sure residents are eating enough or drinking enough or give the hands-on loving care that family members provide,” Palmer said.\n\nAs for the nursing home industry, there are signs this lesson has hit home. In a statement about the national Essential Caregivers Act, the American Health Care Association said, “We applaud this bill and welcome family members and friends taking an active role in the care of their loved ones.” The statement was forwarded by Cristina Crawford, senior manager of public affairs.\n\nRuth Katz, senior vice president of public policy at Leading Age, another long-term care association, wrote in a statement that her group believes quality care “includes residents’ ability to maintain regular connections to and contact with family and friends” and expects new federal rules to reinforce caregivers’ efforts to support nursing home residents in emergencies in the future.'}}",84.75,1

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He also appeared on Fox News on Oct. 11, discussing the exchange with host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBut Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and news reports before the vaccine’s approval were clear that while the vaccine was effective in preventing symptomatic and severe disease, there was no data about whether it stopped transmission to others.\n\nSome may have been surprised at Small’s answer, given public officials’ comments about vaccines and transmission. Both Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said that vaccination can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC in May 2021 changed its guidance on masking, with Fauci saying on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that vaccinated people’s chances of transmitting the virus to others was low. The agency reversed course on that guidance two months later, when it became clear that wasn’t the case with the delta variant.\n\nBut the notion that Pfizer ""admitted"" it didn’t test its vaccine for its ability to stop transmission is incorrect.\n\nAndrew Widger, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said in a statement that details of its phase 3 clinical trial have been online since 2020, and that the trial was never intended to study transmission.\n\nThe phase 3 clinical trial was ""designed and powered"" to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease, Widger said. ""Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,"" he said, which means it wasn’t an outcome being studied.\n\nThe FDA, meanwhile, said in its Dec. 11, 2020, announcement of emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine that there wasn’t yet ""evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person."" A Pfizer press release that same day and another announcing its approval in the European Union on Dec. 21, 2020, made no mention of the vaccine’s effect on transmission.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the outcomes being measured in the original vaccine trials for Pfizer and Moderna were always about their effectiveness against ""symptomatic COVID-19.""\n\n""So, the prevention of transmission (and asymptomatic COVID) were not primary endpoints of these trials and were never a claim of the pharmaceutical companies in developing these vaccines,"" Gandhi said, adding, ""Indeed, this revelation is not new.""\n\nTara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiology professor, agreed, saying the Pfizer executive’s statement was ""not a ‘gotcha.’"" In a December 2020 article for the online website SELF, Smith wrote that the vaccine’s ability to stop transmission was an unanswered question, noting that it’s common in initial vaccine trials for that topic to be addressed in later studies.\n\n""We were hopeful in spring/early summer 2021 that vaccines would be effective against transmission. Delta did change that a bit, making it clear that while vaccines did, and still do, help to reduce one’s risk of infection, they alone are not enough to stop transmission,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That’s why many of us were and remain frustrated at CDC’s messaging around masks, suggesting the vaccinated could stop masking.""\n\nBefore the delta and omicron variants came along, studies suggested that the vaccines were somewhat effective in slowing transmission of the coronavirus.\n\n""In the era before omicron, and to some extent the delta variant, the vaccines clearly were transmission-halting to a high degree,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOnce variants began evading vaccine immunity and breakthrough infections became more common, he added, vaccines were less likely to stop transmission.\n\nWhen Walensky ""said that vaccines decrease transmission and therefore, getting vaccinated protected others, she was providing accurate information to the American public based on data at the time,"" said Gandhi.\n\nIt’s clear that the vaccines are not a firewall against transmission to others, despite misleading claims on two occasions by President Joe Biden that we fact-checked in 2021.\n\nCurrently, Gandhi said, a recent study during the Omicron surge showed that vaccines or prior infection each decreased transmission to others by about 20%.\n\n""The pharmaceutical companies and the CDC both were accurate in terms of their messaging and reporting on the vaccines over time in terms of their ability to reduce transmission and — currently — their incredible ability to reduce severe disease due to the generation of cellular immunity,"" Gandhi said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Instagram post claimed that a Pfizer executive suddenly ""admitted"" that its COVID-19 vaccine had not been tested for preventing transmission before it went to market.\n\nBut this is not a revelation. Pfizer’s clinical trial was always intended to study whether the vaccine prevented recipients from getting symptomatic COVID-19 and whether it prevented severe disease. Pfizer did not claim to have data about transmission of the virus to others.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2381224/judge-scraps-75-year-fda-timeline-to-release-pfizer-vaccine-safety-data-giving-agency-eight-months/', 'Headline': 'Judge scraps 75-year FDA timeline to release Pfizer vaccine safety data ...', 'Snippet': 'Rather than producing 500 pages a month, the FDA’s proposed timeline, Pittman ordered the agency to turn over 55,000 a month.

""Contrary to Pfizer’s public statements, however, the pandemic did not end; it got worse"" in 2021, the complaint reads.\n\n""We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,"" Paxton said in a press release. ""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/may/12/instagram-posts/pfizers-23-billion-settlement-was-not-related-to-c/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer’s $2.3 billion settlement was not related to COVID-19 vaccines', 'Snippet': 'We rate the claim that the video shows Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion in a health care fraud settlement involving COVID-19 vaccines False.

The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00873-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Zero COVID in China: what next? - The Lancet', 'Snippet': ""The zero-COVID strategy has been the pillar of China's anti-epidemic policies for over 2 years.

With a population of 1.41 billion, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by ...', 'Full_text': 'It is challenging to strike a balance between epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add1891', 'Headline': 'Zeroing out on zero-COVID | Science - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID helped slow the spread and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39638-4', 'Headline': 'Swift and extensive Omicron outbreak in China after sudden exit from ...', 'Snippet': 'It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that ...', 'Full_text': 'Understanding the official case count data during the different phases of public health policy\n\nWe first aimed to understand the spread of the Omicron variant in China immediately before the relaxation of zero-COVID (i.e., between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, 2022). Under zero-COVID, testing was mandatory and frequent, leading the official case count data to be a reliable portrayal of the levels of COVID-19 infection in China. Despite the strict measures, such as frequent city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals, the data show a clear exponential increase in COVID-19 cases (caused by the extremely transmissible Omicron variants) shortly before the relaxation of zero-COVID (Fig. 1a). Using a negative binomial regression, we estimated the rate of this exponential growth to be 0.14/day (95% CI: [0.13, 0.15]/day) during this period.\n\nOfficial data after Nov. 11 (when zero-COVID was replaced by 20 Measures and subsequently 10 Measures) report that growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic slowed (Fig. 1a), and eventually the official daily reported cases declined after Nov. 27. This pattern is unexpected. Presumably, the relaxation of strict interventions under zero-COVID would lead to more rapid spread, contrary to what is observed from the official case count data. We reason that the only plausible explanation is the cessation of the requirement for mass testing and rigorous reporting, which led to a rapid decoupling of the surveillance data from the epidemic intensity. As a result, the official case count data after Nov. 11 reflect the rapidly declining detection rate rather than real change in the infection dynamics.\n\nEstimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Nov. and Dec. 2022\n\nTo compensate for the under-reported official case count data after Nov. 11, we collected results from a large online survey conducted on Dec. 26, 2022 by a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security13. The survey reported the fraction of individuals in three categories: those who thought they had never been infected, thought they currently had COVID-19 symptoms, or thought they had been but were no longer symptomatic (see “Methods” for details). Note that these survey categories do not directly correspond to the epidemiological states of susceptible, infected, and recovered, because each person is reporting based on symptoms and does not know their true infectiousness status. In particular, individuals may become infectious before their symptoms begin, and their symptoms may linger even after they are no longer infectious. When interpreted correctly, however, these data should provide insight into the epidemic stage and thus allow inference of the epidemic dynamics.\n\nWe developed an expanded susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that mapped reporting based on symptoms to true infection status. The states of the model are explained in Fig. 2, and equations and further details are provided in “Methods”. We separated the model into three time periods to allow changes in official policy to affect the transmission rate (Fig. 1a). Official case counts were reliable for the first period, up to Nov. 11, due to mandatory and frequent testing. There is no clear observation for the second period, so we simply assumed the transmission rate must be no less than in the first period. The dynamics of the third period were then mainly determined by the population survey data on Dec. 26.\n\nOur model assumes no pre-existing population immunity against Omicron. We calculated the levels of vaccine-induced population immunity against Omicron infection based on published vaccination data14 and the decay of vaccine effectiveness against infection15 (see “Methods” and Fig. S2). We found that the population immunity before the Dec. 2022 wave of Omicron was below 0.1%, and thus would have negligible effect on the model inference.\n\nFitting the model to the case count and survey data, we estimated that the outbreak in China grew exponentially at a rate of 0.15/day (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.13, 0.15]/day) under zero-COVID between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, increased slightly to 0.17 [0.14, 0.17]/day under 20 Measures, and increased dramatically to 0.42 [0.35, 0.44]/day immediately after full exit from zero-COVID (Fig. 1c), with the epidemic then peaking around Dec. 23 (Fig. 1d). This translates to an epidemic doubling time of 4.7 [4.5, 5.4] days, 4.2 [4.0, 5.0] days, and 1.6 [1.6, 2.0] days for the three periods, respectively.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days for Omicron16 (see “Methods”), we calculated the reproductive number, Rexp, during the exponential increase stage of the three periods. It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that the zero-COVID policy prior to relaxation suppressed the transmission of these Omicron variants by 56% [46%, 64%].\n\nOur results suggest that on Dec. 7, the day when full exit from zero-COVID was announced, there were ~1 million new infections. Because of the extremely high rate of spread afterwards, the outbreak ballooned such that 97% [95%, 99%] of the population (i.e., 1.37 billion people) became infected in December. As a result of the exponential nature of the spread, the vast majority of people (88% [83%, 93%] of the population) became infected during the short window of time between Dec. 15 and 31, 2022 (Fig. 1d).\n\nRobustness to model and data assumptions\n\nWe tested the robustness of our findings—particularly, that nearly the entire population became infected in Dec. 2022—to many properties of the data and model.\n\nFirst, we previously assumed that the numbers of confirmed cases from Oct. 28 to Nov. 11 represented the actual number of infected individuals, i.e., that the case reporting rate in China was 100%. This is a reasonable approximation because of the mandatory mass testing in place: all individuals were required to get tested every 2–5 days. However, it is possible that some infected individuals were not detected. We therefore considered an alternative in which the reporting rate was only 50%. Here, the estimated growth rate after Dec. 7 was reduced slightly to 0.40/day, the size of the susceptible population by the end of Dec. remained below 4%, and the epidemic again peaked on Dec. 23 (Fig. S3).\n\nSecond, we previously assumed the Dec. 26 survey results were an unbiased random sample of the entire population. If, however, recovered people were more likely to respond to the survey, or people reported symptoms not due to COVID-19 (e.g., instead due to influenza—an unlikely scenario given the recent report by China CDC5), the numbers of symptomatic or recovered individuals would be over-reported and our growth rate estimate would be too high. We therefore made a large perturbation of the Dec. 26 data by moving 20% of people from each of the symptomatic and recovered categories into the uninfected category. The estimated growth rate was then reduced slightly to 0.39/day after Dec. 7, the size of the susceptible population by Dec. 31 remained below 4%, and the epidemic peak moved slightly to Dec. 24 (Fig. S4).\n\nThird, in our inference of the transmission rates, we fixed many parameter values from the literature. We tested the sensitivity of our results to those assumed values by re-fitting the model using different values. In one strategy, we set the value of each state transition parameter (kE, kIP, kIS, kS, kA, and kT; all defined in Fig. 2, Table S3, Eq. 1) to either 25% higher or lower than our baseline value (Fig. S5). In another strategy, we assigned an appropriate amount of uncertainty to the incubation period, pre-symptomatic period, symptomatic period, generation interval, and time to PCR testing, drew values from each distribution, and derived the state transition parameters (details in Table S3); this was repeated 25 times. In all cases, the median exponential growth rate remained above 0.25/day after Dec. 7, the median size of the population still susceptible by Dec. 31 remained <6% and the 95% CrI remained <10%, and the epidemic peak remained between Dec. 21–25.\n\nFourth, we previously assumed that the entire population is well-mixed. If, however, population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection, such as people who live in urban areas or younger age groups) were also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. To test the impact of population structure on our conclusions, we extended our model to build a meta-population model with two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates. We assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. We considered various scenarios with different assumptions about the contact rates between the two subpopulations and the contact rate in the unsampled population (see Fig. S6 and “Methods”). In general, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and that >90% of the entire population was infected by the end of Dec. (Fig. S7), consistent with our main findings. This suggests that for a virus that transmits extremely efficiently and rapidly, like Omicron, population structure and heterogeneity play only a small role in dictating the overall rate and magnitude of the epidemic, as long as subpopulations are not entirely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, allowing for under-reporting of official case count data before Nov. 11, over-reporting of symptoms in the Dec. 26 survey, uncertainty in parameter values taken from the literature, or population sub-structure did not change our conclusions.\n\nModel validation using additional datasets\n\nWe furthermore validated our results by comparing them against datasets and analyses that were not used in the inference above. First, China CDC subsequently released data on voluntary PCR and antigen tests for most of Dec. 2022 and Jan. 20235. After the full exit from zero-COVID, the test strategy was changed from all population-based to those who request to be tested and groups at risk. The total number of tests declined from a peak of 150 million tests on Dec. 9, to 7.54 million on Jan. 1. The test positivity rate ranged between a few percent to a peak of 29.4% on Dec. 255. Although these data may not directly reveal the magnitude of the true case counts because of the voluntary nature of the reports, they can reveal the pace and the peak timing of the epidemic. We adjusted our model predictions to reflect the nature of voluntary tests (see “Methods”), and found surprisingly close agreement with the national testing data in Dec. 2022 (Fig. 3).\n\nSecond, the Sichuan CDC conducted a large daily survey in which residents of the province reported their infection status, the date of test positivity, and the date of symptom onset17. We found that the exponential growth rate of the epidemic in early Dec. in Sichuan, as measured by test positivity or symptom onset (0.37/day or 0.43/day, respectively; Fig. S8) is remarkably consistent with our estimates above for the country as a whole.\n\nThird, an analysis of self-reported infection rate focused on vaccine efficacy but also reported an epidemic curve18. Based on 2316 survey responses, the study reported that 82.4% of people in China had confirmed cases by Feb. 2023. This number excludes, however, asymptomatic cases that were not revealed by testing. If 9% of infected people never developed symptoms (median value from Fig. S1) and most of those cases were not caught by testing (due to the lack of mandatory testing and the lack of incentive for most non-symptomatic people to test themselves, leading to the high test positivity rate by end-Dec5.), it is likely that more than 90% of people in that survey had been infected. The small sample size of that survey would also induce large uncertainty, leading to a result for the final epidemic size that is not inconsistent with our model-based analysis on larger datasets.\n\nWe modeled the epidemic dynamics of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in China from Nov. to Dec. 2022, during a period when China moved from having strict COVID-19 policies (‘zero-COVID’), to little-to-no intervention efforts. We found that after full exit from zero-COVID, the Omicron variant spread at a very high rate of 0.42/day, with a doubling time of 1.6 days, during early and mid-Dec. before the incidence peaked around Dec. 23. Our point estimate is that 97% of the population (1.4 billion people) was infected during December, with a lower 95% credibility interval of 95% of the population (1.33 billion) and a lower limit in the sensitivity analyses of 90% (1.26 billion). With an infection fatality ratio between 0.1 and 0.2% for the Omicron variant19, we would expect between 1.3 and 2.6 million COVID-19 deaths in China during Dec. 2022 as well as Jan. 2023 (because of the delay from infection to death).\n\nInfection of more than one billion people during one month would lead to a large number of people needing health care, far exceeding the hospital capacity, and thus explains the report that hospitals were overwhelmed during this period6. This outcome emphasizes the need for gradually relaxing intervention efforts (instead of abruptly changing policy) and implementing additional measures (e.g., pharmaceutical strategies) to ‘flatten the curve’9. A slower epidemic wave would help to ease hospital burden, allow sufficient health care for infected people, prevent epidemic overshoot (i.e., a large final epidemic size because of rapid spread20), and ultimately reduce the number of deaths. Such considerations may be of renewed importance later in 2023, when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 may become susceptible to reinfection.\n\nOur results differ from a recent paper by Leung et al.21 that modeled the epidemic dynamics in Beijing over a similar period. First, they estimated that the highest rate of epidemic growth occurred in mid-Nov., a period when substantial intervention efforts were still in place, whereas our estimates suggest the rate of epidemic growth was highest after the full exit from zero-COVID. Second, they estimated that the epidemic incidence in Beijing had two peaks (one on Dec. 10 and another on Dec. 21), whereas we estimated the epidemic in China as a whole peaked on Dec. 23, remarkably consistent with the newly released data from China CDC5 (Fig. 3). These results in Leung et al.21 are strongly driven by the assumption that the overall contact rate is a function of the daily number of subway travelers, which peaked mid-November. However, it is unclear how the number of subway passengers is related to transmission, given that a large fraction of transmission likely occurs in the household22. More generally, it has been shown that human mobility after the first wave of the epidemic in 2020 relates to changes in transmission in complex ways23; the relationship between the mobility measures and transmission can be insignificant in many countries, country-specific, or intervention policy-specific. As a result, the results in Leung et al.21 could be biased by this strong assumption.\n\nOne limitation of our analysis is that it is heavily dependent on the online infection status survey data on Dec. 26. We directly addressed two concerns about these data. First, the survey could over-state the progression of the epidemic if people with symptoms are more likely to take the survey, or if people mistake influenza for COVID-19 symptoms. Recent data from the China CDC report5 shows that among individuals who had influenza-like illnesses and were tested for both COVID-19 and influenza, only a very small fraction were positive for influenza, especially in late Dec. Nevertheless, we artificially increased the proportion of uninfected people in the survey and obtained very similar results. Second, because the survey was conducted online, the demographic characteristics of the participants may be different from the general population. In particular, if a substantial subpopulation did not participate in the survey and also experienced lower rates of spread—for example, people living in sparsely populated areas—our estimate of the total number of people infected could be too high. We tested this assumption by fitting a structured population model and obtained very similar results. Finally, we validated our model findings against other data sources that were not used in our model inference. We found strong concordance with both the estimated peak time of the epidemic and its growth trajectory. These many lines of evidence strongly suggest that our estimation is reliable and robust, despite the limitations of the available data.\n\nAnother piece of evidence supporting our conclusion is the lack of a COVID-19 wave in January 2023 (for example, see the China CDC report5). The Chinese New Year travel rush, i.e., during which many migrant workers and students go back to hometown to celebrate the Chinese New Year, occurred in Jan., and a large fraction of these travel routes would be from cities to rural villages. Presumably, this travel rush would increase the frequency of risky contact substantially throughout China. The fact that there is no indication of any sizable COVID outbreak during this period (e.g., indicators of COVID-19 infection, including positive tests and fever clinic visits, decreased continuously throughout Jan. 20235) strongly suggests that a large majority of individuals are already infected in Dec., as we predicted in the model.\n\nBroader implications for understanding the transmission of the Omicron variant and for public health\n\nUnlike most other countries where there existed sizable levels of population immunity against the Omicron variant arising from recent natural infection and/or vaccination, we estimated that the population in China had very little to no protection against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the growth rate 0.42/day (translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days) during the exponential growth period we estimated may be a good approximation of the intrinsic transmissibility of the variants BA.5 and BF.7 in a densely populated area without population immunity. This is in stark contrast to the growth rate 0.29/day (and an epidemic doubling time of 2.4 days) that we estimated for the Wuhan outbreak before intervention efforts were in place in Jan. 202024. This highlights the extremely high intrinsic transmissibility of the Omicron variant in a naive population.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days16, we estimated the reproductive number during exponential growth, Rexp to be 3.1. Note that a recent study using contact tracing data from Italy estimated the intrinsic generation time to be 6.8 days25, although the realized generation time for household transmission where frequent contacts occur between family members was 3.6 days. This relatively large difference in the estimated generation times suggests another layer of complexity in calculating the reproductive number, i.e., it depends on whether the transmission is mostly driven by household transmission (frequent contacts) or non-household transmission (less frequent contacts), which may change in different epidemiological contexts and epidemic stages. The reproductive number, Rexp, we calculated here is likely accurate when the transmission is dominated by household transmission, e.g., when prevalence is relatively high in a community. However, at the beginning of an epidemic when only a few individuals are infected, the transmission is likely to be a mixture of household and non-household transmission; in this case, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be higher than Rexp we estimated here.\n\nQuantifying the growth rates before and after zero-COVID, we estimated these intervention efforts reduced the transmission of the Omicron variant by around 56%. As a comparison, the effect of lock-down during the spread of the original variant in early 2020 was estimated to be 70–80% in Europe26. Interestingly, the Omicron outbreak in China had already been growing in Nov. 2022 before the relaxation of zero-COVID (albeit at a low rate). This may reflect the high transmissibilty of the variant, and that the stringent measures of the zero-COVID policy were not effectively implemented because of factors such as population noncompliance due to pandemic fatigue. Nonetheless, these results highlight the difficulty of containing a respiratory infection that causes explosive outbreaks and transmits during the presymptomatic or asymptomatic period.\n\nBecause the epidemic grew so rapidly in Dec., we may expect another sizable wave of infection later in 2023 when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 become susceptible to reinfection. The timing and magnitude of the future wave would depend on how quickly the population immunity wanes over time27,28,29 and the ability of newly emerging variants to evade the immunity caused by the Omicron variants30,31. Therefore, modeling efforts that evaluate intervention strategies, including vaccination, will be crucial to reduce the level of infection and mortality.\n\nDatasets and sources\n\nOfficial case counts\n\nNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China had been releasing reports on COVID-19 infections from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 23, 202232. These reports include numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, imported and recovered infections, and deaths across the country. Because the definitions of ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ infections have been changing over time, we use only the total number of cases by summing the two categories. We retrieved all official data from Sina Pandemic Map33, which provides pre-processed and well-organized daily case data from NHC. Note the NHC data are also used as a source for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard34.\n\nPrevalence survey on Dec. 26, 2022\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2022, the RenSheTong online platform (https://m12333.cn), a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, conducted a one-day online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in China13. There were 47,897 participants in total. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was reported in four categories. ‘Uninfected’ was defined as individuals who had never tested positive or were unaware they were infected. ‘Asymptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive, but did not have symptoms of infection at the time of the survey. ‘Symptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they were infected, and were experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey. ‘Recovered’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they had been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had recovered from symptoms of infection. We interpreted the last category to imply recovered from recent infection, i.e., in end-2022, but there would be little consequence if it also included people who had been infected in previous years because <1% of the population had been infected prior to Nov. 202234. Survey questions are reproduced in Table S2 and survey results by province are provided in a supplemental data file. Because of the small number of respondents in the Asymptomatic category, our analyses folded them in with the Uninfected category, which already included individuals who could be infected but without symptoms. Note that in the survey 95% of infected people reported symptoms, which is consistent with the fraction of infections estimated to be symptomatic by our model (Fig. S1). We computed the total number of people in each survey category under the assumption that the proportion of survey respondents in each category was representative of the respective province as a whole. That is, the prevalences in Fig. 1b are the country’s total population size multiplied by 28.3% Uninfected, 42.5% Infected, and 29.2% Recovered.\n\nParticipants in the survey were also asked about the duration of symptoms. We fitted an Erlang distribution to the survey data by estimating the mean of the distribution and adjusting the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution from 1 to 10.\n\nChinese CDC reports of number of positive tests after Dec. 9, 2022\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released national COVID-19 pandemic data on Jan. 25, 2023, including PCR test results, antigen test results, outpatient and inpatient data, variant surveillance data, and vaccination progress across the country5. Data were collected from official surveillance systems, labs, hospitals, and mobile applications where residents could upload their antigen test results voluntarily. We used daily numbers of positive PCR and antigen tests and daily test positivity rates.\n\nSichuan survey on Dec. 25 and 26, 2022\n\nThe Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Health conducted an online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in Sichuan province on Dec. 24 and 2517. There were a total of 158,506 participants. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was categorized as ‘uninfected’ or ‘tested positive either by PCR or antigen test.’ In addition, participants reported the date that they tested positive and the date of their symptom onset.\n\nCopies of all datasets are included as supplemental files.\n\nThe expanded SEIR model\n\nWe developed an SEIR-type model to encompass not only the daily case counts from extensive official testing, but also the survey data in which respondents’ answers were based on symptoms. In this model, we categorized the population into 12 classes, plus 2 additional classes for bookkeeping: S for susceptible, E1 and E2 for exposed, IP for pre-symptomatic and infectious, IS for symptomatic and infectious, RS1, RS2, and RS3 for recovered from infectiousness but still symptomatic, RS for recovered and no longer with symptoms, IA1 and IA2 for asymptomatic and infectious, and RA for recovered and never having symptoms. Multiple stages were used for some categories (e.g., stages E1 and E2 for the exposed category) in order to obtain more realistic distributions of waiting times35, as discussed below. States T1 and T2 were used to record individuals who test positive, in order to compare with daily case counts. Figure 2 shows how individuals transit from one class to another. Parameters ki govern the rates of flow from one class to the next, f is the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms, and w is the proportion of cases found by testing. The system of equations defining this model is:\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N$$\n\n(1a)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{1}}{dt}=\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N-{k}_{E}{E}_{1}$$\n\n(1b)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{E}{E}_{1}-{k}_{E}{E}_{2}$$\n\n(1c)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{P}}{dt}={k}_{E}f{E}_{2}-{k}_{IP}{I}_{P}$$\n\n(1d)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{IP}{I}_{P}-{k}_{IS}{I}_{S}$$\n\n(1e)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S1}}{dt}={k}_{IS}{I}_{S}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S1}$$\n\n(1f)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S2}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S1}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S2}$$\n\n(1g)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S3}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S2}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1h)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1i)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A1}}{dt}={k}_{E}(1-f){E}_{2}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A1}$$\n\n(1j)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A2}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A1}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1k)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{A}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1l)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{1}}{dt}={k}_{E}w{E}_{2}-{k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1m)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1n)\n\nIn this model, susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals (in compartments IP + IS + IA1 + IA2) through contacts at rate β. Infected individuals first become exposed but not infectious. We used two compartments (E1 and E2) to model this period to reflect the fact that the distribution of the exposed period (i.e., from infection to becoming infectious) usually follows a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution. Exposed individuals then become infectious, and IP and IS represent infectious individuals at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively. Individuals lose infectiousness a few days after symptom onset36, whereas symptoms may last for a longer period of time. Stages RS1, RS2, and RS3 describe symptomatic individuals who are no longer infectious. Again, using three stages allows us to match the distribution of the symptomatic period to the distribution estimated from data13. Note that, in the survey, participants in the ‘infected’ category were categorized based on whether the participants have COVID symptoms or not. Therefore, the ‘infected’ category corresponds to individuals in the states IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3. When individuals recover from symptoms, they enter state RS.\n\nOur model also keeps track of asymptomatically infected individuals, i.e., individuals who never develop symptoms throughout infection. In the model, we assume a fraction, 1 − f, of individuals remain asymptomatic after the exposed period. We use two IA stages to describe the duration of infectious period as a gamma distribution. RA keeps track of individuals recovered from asymptomatic infection. We do not differentiate the stages of individuals recovering from asymptomatic infection (as we did for individuals recovering from symptomatic infection) because individuals in all of these stages would have reported as the same category in the symptoms-based survey, and they remain in this class.\n\nOverall, our model structure allowed us to map our model states to the categories in the Dec. 26 online survey. People who reported themselves ‘uninfected’ could be truly susceptible (S), asymptomatic but exposed (E1, E2) or infected (IA1, IA2), or recovered never having had symptoms (RA). People who reported themselves ‘infected’ were experiencing symptoms, so they could be still infectious (IS) or no longer infectious (RS1, RS2, RS3). People reporting themselves ‘recovered’ were no longer experiencing symptoms (RS).\n\nTo fit the model to official COVID-19 case counts, we used T1 and T2 to keep track of individuals who would eventually be tested. Note that they do not contribute to the transmission dynamics. Parameter w is the fraction of infected individuals who are tested, and it ranges between 0 and 1. The waiting time from becoming infectious to being tested positive is 1/kT.\n\nParameter values and statistical inference\n\nWe fixed most of the parameters in the model to values estimated from epidemiological studies. We used an incubation period for Omicron of mean 3.4 days37 and a generation interval for Omicron of mean 3.3 days16. Both distributions can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 3, so in our model there are three states describing individuals who are infected but yet to develop symptoms (E1, E2, and IP). We then set the rate parameters kE = 2/1.9 /day and kIP = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean pre-symptomatic infectious period is 1.5 days38 and total incubation period is 3.4 days37, and kIS = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean infectious period after symptom onset is 1.5 days.\n\nWe estimated from the population survey data (Table S2) that the distribution of the symptomatic period can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.7 days and a shape parameter of 413. Therefore, in our model, we used four states to represent the symptomatic period (IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3), and we set kS = 3/4.2 /day such that the mean duration that an individual is in the RS1, RS2 or RS3 state is 4.2 days and thus the mean symptomatic period is 4.2 + 1.5 = 5.7 days. We also set 2/kA = 1/kIP + 1/kIS such that the mean infectious period of the asymptomatically infected is assumed the same as symptomatically infected. Parameter values are summarized in Table S3.\n\nOur model contained six free parameters: the transmission rate during each of the three periods (βi), the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms (f), an initial number of exposed individuals in mid-Oct. (E0), and an overdispersion parameter for the count data (ϕ), which were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.\n\nFor the initial condition of the ODE system, we assumed an entirely susceptible population except for E1 = E2 ≡ E0 on Oct. 22, one week before the beginning of the case count data we fit. This is consistent with very little pre-existing immunity through either prior natural infection (<1% of the population had ever been infected by this time34) or vaccination (Fig. S2). The model was fit using Bayesian inference and implemented in the Stan programming language39. We set the prior distribution of each βi to be normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 2, the prior on f to be uniform between 0 and 1, the prior on E0 to be uniform between 1 and ten times the number of cases on the first day of data, and the prior on ϕ−1 to be exponential with mean 5. These are weak priors, and the posterior estimates (shown in Fig. S1) were not sensitive to them.\n\nThe growth rate, r, during the exponential growth period of the outbreak was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the ODE system, Eq. 1, assuming the population is fully susceptible (i.e., S = N).\n\nCalculation of the reproductive number during exponential growth, R exp\n\nWe used the growth rates, r, of SARS-CoV-2 in China estimated in this study and the distribution of the intrinsic generation interval to calculate the reproductive number Rexp. This is the estimated instantaneous reproductive number during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak after Dec. 8 and before the peak. According to Abbott et al.16, the distribution of the generation interval has a mean of 3.3 days and a shape parameter close to 3. Rexp is then calculated using the formula provided in Park et al.40:\n\n$${R}_{exp}=\\frac{1}{\\int\\,g(\\tau )\\exp (-r\\tau )d\\tau }$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g is the density function of the intrinsic generation interval distribution.\n\nRegression to estimate exponential growth rates\n\nThe rates of exponential growth in Sichuan province during Dec. 2022 were estimated by fitting a linear regression model to the fractions of COVID-19-positive individuals or individuals whose symptoms began between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The Dec. 1 data point was ignored because it is likely to include individuals who tested positive or started to have symptoms before Dec. 1. The fitting was performed using the lm() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nWe estimated the rate of exponential growth using the official case count data by fitting a generalized negative binomial regression to the case count time series. Fitting was performed with the glm.nb() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nEstimating population immunity against Omicron infection\n\nLau et al.15 estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the CoronaVac vaccine against Omicron infection: 7 days following immunization, the VE for the second and third doses were 5% (0–27%) and 30% (1–66%), respectively, and then the VE reduced exponentially to 1% (0–11%) and 6% (0–29%), respectively, 100 days after immunization. We used these values in our calculation, assuming that all the vaccines administered in China follow the same VE characteristics as CoronaVac. We then collected data on the fractions of people who already received two doses or three doses of vaccine over time from ref. 14 (Fig. S2a). From this dataset, we estimated the fractions of people newly vaccinated with their second or third dose over the entire period of consideration. Note that the fourth dose of vaccine was not authorized in China until mid-Dec. 2022, and therefore we did not include the fourth dose in our calculation.\n\nWe calculated the population immunity against Omicron on day d, P(d), as\n\n$$P(d)=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i={d}_{0}}^{d}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=2}^{3}{G}_{j}(d-i){Q}_{j}(i)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qj(i) is the fraction newly vaccinated with the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i, and Gj(d − i) is the VE on day d given an individual received the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i. The expected and upper bound estimates (Fig. S2b) were made using the expected and upper bound estimates of the VE.\n\nRobustness of conclusions to existence of population structure\n\nWe considered the impact of population structure on the main conclusions of our model. If population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection) are also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. For example, people who live in urban areas with good internet access and health care facilities may be more likely to be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey, while also experiencing more opportunity for infection; whereas people living in rural areas (far away from testing facilities and with poor internet connections) may not be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey. Another example is that people in younger age groups may have larger numbers of contacts and be more likely to participate in online surveys than people in older age groups.\n\nTo capture this effect as simply as possible, we included two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates, with an even lower rate of contact between the two subpopulations. Specifically, we assumed that during each time period, the transmission rate in the low-contact subpopulation was half that of the high-contact subpopulation, and the transmission rate between subpopulations was one-tenth as large. We also assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. The full model structure is provided in Fig. S6.\n\nWe first partitioned the entire country’s population to be 65% in the high-contact subpopulation and 35% in the low-contact subpopulation. This partition is motivated by the nationwide urban–rural proportion. Because the Dec. 26 survey includes participants from both urban and rural areas, this division represents an overestimate of the size of the unsampled population. Indeed, the majority of population in China has good internet access (through cell phones) and access to COVID-testing sites. Therefore we additionally considered a model where the population is partitioned to be 80% in the high-contact subpopulation and 20% in the low-contact subpopulation, which is probably more appropriate with respect to the survey data. We fit both models to the official case count data and the Dec. 26 survey data as in the main text. Irrespective of the partition, our results from this model were consistent with our main findings. For the 80%–20% and 65%–35% partitions, respectively, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and only 2.6% or 6.7% of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of December (Fig. S7ab).\n\nWe further tested a scenario where the partition is 80% and 20% for the sampled and unsampled subpopulations, respectively, and transmission between the subpopulations was only one-hundredth of the transmission rate within the sampled subpopulation. Note that this is an extreme and unlikely scenario where the two subpopulations were not well connected at all. We found that infection in the low-contact subpopulation lagged behind the high-contact subpopulation even more than in the previous scenarios, as expected (Fig. S7c). The amount of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of Dec. increased slightly to 10.9%, and the epidemic peak remained on Dec. 23.\n\nModel adjustment for testing intensity and willingness in the China CDC data\n\nWe compared the fitted model trajectory against the China CDC data to validate our model estimations. For this, we multiplied the total cases predicted by the model by a factor to correct for testing effort and the willingness to get tested. We defined\n\n$$T=C\\frac{{n}_{T}/{p}_{T}}{(N-R)v},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the model-adjusted inferred number of positive tests (plotted as colored bands in Fig. 3), C is the total number of model-predicted cases (gray band in Fig. 3), nT is the number of positive tests, pT is the test positivity rate, N is the total country population size, R is the number of individuals in the recovered non-symptomatic model states (RS + RA), and v is an unknown factor related to the proportion of the population that engages in voluntary testing. The term (N − R)v reflects that not all individuals engage in the testing and among those who engage, individuals who know they are recovered likely do not get tested or self-test any more. Values of all the quantities in Eq. (4) are known for each day—from the model fit or the reported data—except for v. We estimated a single value of v (across all days) for each testing type by least-squares fitting, using Eq. (4), obtaining v = 0.44 for the PCR tests and v = 0.52 for the antigen tests.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44. Over half of American businesses in China either delayed or decreased investments in China due to lockdown measures, according to a recent survey by the local U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThanks to current measures, “China might be seen as a less reliable trading partner than previously,” says Nordin, of Kings College. “The question is how much less reliable than other possible alternatives?”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID U-Turn Reveals Xi Jinping’s Deep Paranoia - TIME', 'Snippet': 'The decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health ...', 'Full_text': 'Even for China, where the distance between official narrative and empirical evidence is often a chasm, the last few days have been jarring. On Tuesday, officials announced five deaths from COVID-19—up from two the previous day, which were the first recorded in the country since Dec. 3. On Wednesday, there were officially none. But a glance online tells a different story. Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63226230', 'Headline': 'China congress: Xi Jinping doubles down on zero-Covid as meeting ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Zero-Covid was a ""people\'s war to stop the spread of the virus"", he said.

At the time, almost every other state used ARPA funds for repaying UI trust fund debt. Per federal law, when a state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund drops to a negative balance, federal funds are automatically borrowed. If the borrowing occurs for a period of two or more years, employers lose credit against their federal unemployment insurance tax—meaning employers will pay higher taxes.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pritzker Administration swapped $450 million from the state UI Trust Fund balance to further pay down a portion of the $1.8 billion federal Title XII debt left outstanding after the $2.7 billion payment was made in mid-2022. Then in December, Governor Pritzker signed SB 1698 (P.A. 102-1105) to provide for the substantive language of the deal, which (1) authorizes the State to use surplus revenues to pay the remaining $1.36 billion Title XII debt and (2) provides for the substantive agreement reached between business and labor groups. The final deal will mitigate tax increases on employers, improve predictability for employers, and bring greater stability to the UI Trust Fund, which was an initial ask of the labor groups. The deal is fair for both employers and workers. In the January Lame Duck Session, SB 2801 passed both the Illinois House and Senate to provide for the appropriation language necessary to finalize the agreement. It is expected that the Governor will sign the bill soon.\n\nThe UI deal is significant for Illinois employers and negates roughly $913 million in additional taxes that employers would have had to pay over the next five years. Perhaps, just as importantly, the deal and bipartisan roll call that ensued preserves the Unemployment Insurance Agreed Bill process, which has been in place since the 1980s and informally requires any legislation impacting the Unemployment Insurance System from advancing without an agreement from both business and labor groups. Without the agreed bill process, we most certainly would see annual employer tax increases. You can find the Chamber and business coalitions fact sheet on the agreement here.\n\nBusiness Development Proposal Passes with Chamber’s Strong Support\n\nEvery year, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce advocates for more State funding, support, and investment by the State in business development. Although the State has many programs and services in place that are meant to help employers throughout the state, amendments are often required.\n\nThe Government Relations team successfully managed to secure transformational changes to some of these state programs, including the following:\n\nGovernor’s “Invest in Illinois” Program: Given the State received an unexpected amount of tax revenue in 2022, due in large part to the lingering positive impact of the pandemic on consumer spending and business earnings, the Governor proposed the creation of a “closing fund”, which would grant the State the ability to offer new or existing businesses that are relocating, expanding, or making substantial investments in Illinois the ability to offer one-time cash grants to incentivize the projects. Other states, such as Ohio, Texas, among others, have perennial closing funds that they use to attract projects to their states. This year, the General Assembly headed the call and created the Invest in Illinois Program. $400 million were allocated to the program this year.\n\nEDGE Tax Credit Program. The bill (1) increases EDGE credits in projects located in underserved areas equal to 50% of the tax attributed to retained employees, (2) erodes the ‘but for” clause requiring EDGE credit applicants from demonstrating other State offers and cost differentials; and (3) reduces the requirement to self-certification. The EDGE program is one of the State’s biggest economic development tools used to attract and retain jobs in Illinois through a series of income and payroll tax credits.\n\nFilm Tax Credit Program. Extends the sunset date of the program from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2033 to allow prospective film or TV productions to have reliability in the program. The Film Tax Credit Program each year helps sustain the rapid growth of the film and TV industry in Illinois by offering productions with several tax incentives to film in Illinois.\n\nExpands Enterprise Zones. Expands the allowable square mileage of a Zone. The EZ program allows for various tax benefits to be offered to businesses that are activated in a Zone.\n\nImproves High Impact Business Program. Doubles the length of an allowable designation of a HIB and removes the requirement for businesses to prove that the incentive is needed. HIB is a tool that the State offers large business expansions or investments in new projects in the State.\n\nREV Credit Program. Expands the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) in Illinois Act (currently, Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act) to allow renewable energy product manufacturers to be eligible for REV credits, in addition to changing eligibility requirements to allow small-to-mid size businesses to apply for the credit. REV was first created in 2021 to incentivize new electric vehicle manufacturers and component part manufacturers to build in Illinois.\n\nMakes changes to the MICRO Act to grant DCEO the ability to determine criteria for the renewal of incentives provided under the Act. Increases the amount of MICRO credits for projects meeting retained employee goals to match new employee incentives. Allows for MICRO credits to be renewed for a total of either 20 or 30 years.\n\nCreates a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase sales tax credit from fuel purchased in Illinois by an air carrier from June 1, 2023 to January 1, 2033 in the amount of $1.50 per gallon of sustainable fuel. Prohibits the collection of the credit on soybean oil-derived SAF until air carriers collectively purchase SAF containing 10 million gallons of soybean oil feedstock.\n\n“Paid Leave for All Workers Act” Passes, Chamber Negotiates Deal\n\nPaid Leave is an issue that has been hotly debated for over five years in the Statehouse, with advocates typically leading the way to push for convoluted, onerous, and punitive proposals on employers. An agreement was finally brokered last week—with the Chamber playing a key role in making sure the best deal for business was reached.\n\nOnce it was clear that advocacy groups, unions, and Democratic leadership were eager to pass a bill in the last week of Session before the start of a new term, the business community came to the negotiating table seeking two main provisions: (1) require that any paid leave law passed by the General Assembly would be clear, easily implemented, and require no more than five days of leave and (2) prohibit the City of Chicago or Cook County (both jurisdictions that already have paid sick leave mandates in place) from enacting their own version of paid leave. In the end, through much negotiation, the final bill that has been sent to the Governor for his signature will contain the following:\n\n5 days of paid time off a year\n\nThere is no requirement for an employee to qualify why their leave is being taken, easing the administrative burden on employers\n\nThe employer may establish a specific process by which an employee may request time off if the request is made prospectively\n\nThe time may be front loaded or rolled-over\n\nExempts collective bargaining agreements\n\nRequires employers to maintain proper records for no less than three years\n\nFor employers that already have a leave policy in place that meets the requirements of this new law, no policy change is required\n\nProhibits retaliation\n\nAllows the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) to investigate any claims alleging a violation of the Law, and allows the IDOL to impose fines ranging from $500-$1000 for violations of the act, in addition to legal awards and additional civil penalties.\n\nThe new Law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and does not apply to any employer that is currently subject to the paid sick leave ordinances that are in effect in the City of Chicago or Cook County.\n\nOther Notable Action\n\nSB 1720 (Sims/Harris) – FY23 BIMP 2.0, which has passed both Chambers and needs to be signed into law by 12 p.m. on January 16 in order for the salary increases to go into effect. Notable provisions include:\n\nProvides for increased salaries for Constitutional Officers, Agency Directors, and members of the General Assembly\n\nThe establishment of the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force\n\n$5 million to DCEO to administer a Local Chamber Recovery Grants program\n\nAllows the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board to make grants to local units of governments and schools for the purpose of hiring and retaining law enforcement officials\n\nIncreases the cap on the Budget Stabilization Fund from 5% to 7.5% of total general funds estimated for the fiscal year and transfer $850 million from GRF to the Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nProvides the authorizing language to appropriate $460 million to hospitals throughout Illinois as hospital pandemic recovery stabilization payments\n\nProvides that, if and only if House Bill 4285 of the 102nd General Assembly becomes law, then the small purchase limit in the Procurement Code is reduced from $250,000 to $100,000\n\nHB 969 (Harris/Harmon) – FY23 Supplemental Appropriations package\n\nSB 2801 (Holmes/Welch) – Finalizes the agreed-bill Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deal to (1) appropriate $1.37 billion from GRF to UI Trust Fund to pay the remaining outstanding federal UI Title VII debt and (2) appropriate $450 million to the UI Trust Fund as a loan to be repaid over a 10-year period. The bill as amended by the House Exec Committee unanimously is awaiting House Floor action before going back to the Senate for concurrence.\n\nSB 1001 (Belt/Zalewski) – Eliminates state and local fees for liquor delivery throughout Illinoi and brings parity for liquor delivery between home-rule and non-home rule municipalities to regulate liquor delivery.\n\nHB 240 (Jones/Gillespie) – Hospital and health care omnibus package\n\nHB 4412 (Willis/Cunnningham) as amended by SA #1 – Limited changes to various energy-related provisions. The most controversial changes pertain to facility siting changes opposed by some units of local government.\n\nHB 268 (Williams/Feigenholtz) as amended by SA #1 – Creates the Tourism Preservation and Sustainability District Act, otherwise known as Tourism Improvement Districts. Similar to Business Improvement Districts, the legislation allows hotel owners to opt into a districts whereby special surcharges are assessed to be used only for the development, services, and benefits of the businesses contained in the Tourism Improvement District. The Chamber continues to discuss a similar model known as Business Improvement Districts with the City of Chicago and other stakeholders.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagolandchamber.org/advocacy-public-policy/business-groups-denounce-chicago-paid-leave-proposal/', 'Headline': 'Business Groups Denounce Chicago Paid Leave Proposal', 'Snippet': 'Measure cements Chicago’s status as a hostile place to do business.

We made repeated efforts to negotiate in good faith to reach a paid leave policy at the City level that is fair and balanced for both workers and businesses, even offering double the State requirement, but labor groups refused to compromise meaningfully, with aldermen now set to vote on a policy that will devastate the very businesses they have been trying to attract to their communities.\n\nThe current proposal will force employers to pay three ways for every day of paid leave. As written, employers will need to provide five days of paid sick leave and five days of paid time off for every employee, pay employees for up to seven days of unused paid time off, and pay enhanced wages for anyone who covers the employee’s shift due to the City’s restrictive scheduling ordinance. On top of this, businesses, especially small businesses without robust human resources departments, will be exposed to the threat of private rights of action. The payout exemption for small businesses contained in the proposal does not extend to this dangerous private right of action language contained in the ordinance.\n\nOnce again, proponents failed to recognize the compounding effect these policies have on businesses that are already struggling to make ends meet due to an alarming number of anti-business proposals by the City, continued supply chain and labor challenges, persistent crime, and skyrocketing property taxes.\n\nWe regularly hear about the need to attract and retain businesses like restaurants, grocery stores, and pharmacies in under-served neighborhoods, and we’re already fighting an uphill battle to fill the exorbitantly high vacancies left by the COVID-19 pandemic in commercial corridors across the city. Businesses cannot withstand the ever-growing financial burden forced upon them with punitive policies including restrictive scheduling, the elimination of tip credits, and efforts to quadruple the real estate transfer tax. The addition of this paid leave policy all but guarantees we will lose that battle.\n\nWith Chicago on the verge of adopting the most complicated and expensive form of paid leave in the country, businesses of every size and sector will be left with no choice but to take their operations – and employees – elsewhere.\n\nAdditional Press Coverage:\n\nCrain’s Chicago: https://www.chicagobusiness.com/politics/pto-policy-heads-chicago-city-council-final-vote\n\nWTTW: https://news.wttw.com/2023/11/02/chicago-workers-get-10-days-paid-time-under-revised-measure-set-final-vote\n\nCBS News: https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-paid-leave-ordinance-workforce-committee-vote/\n\nChicago Tribune: https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-paid-leave-workforce-committee-vote-20231102-aq2m7bzllfc27j6tuuwny2q3ba-story.html\n\nChicago Sun Times: https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/11/2/23943393/paid-leave-ordinance-committee-vote-chicago-restaurants-sick-days-time-off'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://chicagocrusader.com/illinois-gets-7-million-for-unemployment-system-upgrades-as-debt-persists/', 'Headline': 'Illinois gets $7 million for unemployment system ... - The Chicago Crusader', 'Snippet': 'Illinois Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Todd Maisch is concerned about the tax burden placed on businesses because of ongoing unemployment debt, which at one point was $4.5 billion.', 'Full_text': 'As Illinois receives a nearly $7 million federal grant to better understand and address unemployment insurance system equity gaps, some continue to express concerns about persistent unemployment debt.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor in September awarded Illinois a $6.8 million million equity grant to better understand and address equity gaps within the Illinois unemployment insurance system.\n\nFour major equity projects will be funded through the grant, according to a news release by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. These projects include upgrading the UI service delivery systems, processes and communications for easier access and experience. This involves making the UI information easier to understand, translating the information into various languages, growing the self-service digital options and increasing the outreach to organizations within the community.\n\n“Since 2019, Governor Pritzker’s administration has supported IDES in its efforts to improve services to individuals with limited English proficiency and other barriers to access,” IDES director Kristin Richards said in the statement. “The work continues, and this grant opportunity will allow IDES to develop the data necessary to make targeted investments to promote equity in our state’s UI system and ensure eligible individuals have access to benefits.”\n\nIllinois is one of 27 states to get a share of more than $150 million of federal taxpayer funded grants for the program.\n\nRichards and IDES have been criticized by members of the Illinois legislature for not providing adequate information about unemployment benefits paid out fraudulently. A recent audit suggested nearly $2 billion in fraudulent payments from during the pandemic from a federal fund operated by Illinois, but the entire scope of fraud couldn’t be acquired because of the agency’s poor record keeping.\n\nIllinois Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Todd Maisch is concerned about the tax burden placed on businesses because of ongoing unemployment debt, which at one point was $4.5 billion. The state recently paid down another $450 million on the debt, but there’s still $1.3 billion remaining.\n\n“As much as we appreciate the extra $450 million, it just bends the curve on the additional employer tax increases that are yet to come,” Maisch told The Center Square.\n\nMaish said Illinois has underperformed in comparison to other states relating to “fraud and cheating of the system” and that employers will see a massive increase in taxes while the unemployed see the same benefits as before.\n\n“The unemployed individuals are going to get all the benefits that they were promised and that they should expect to see but employers are going to pay for all of that,” he said. “If organized labor doesn’t want to come to the table, then that means, coming out of a COVID recession and coming out of maybe a new recession, that employers are going to be saddled with millions, if not billions of dollars of extra UI costs.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance/736789/chicago-fed-president-sees-higher-interest-rates-bringing-higher-unemployment/', 'Headline': 'Chicago fed president sees higher interest rates bringing higher ...', 'Snippet': '(The Center Square) – The president of the Chicago Federal Reserve said interest rate hikes in the future could increase unemployment.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/data-deep-dive-how-government-benefits-programs-are-contributing-to-the-labor-shortage', 'Headline': 'Data Deep Dive: How Government Benefits Programs Are Contributing to ...', 'Snippet': 'The impact of enhanced unemployment benefits.

From March 2020 to September 2021, the federal government provided an additional $300 - $600 a week to any person who was earning at least $1 in UI benefits.\n\nThe enhanced UI benefits were generous compared to regular UI benefits. On average, UI typically replaces 38% of a claimant’s average weekly wage.\n\nThe enhancement meant that most individuals were earning more on unemployment than they were while working, boosting Americans’ savings accounts, and deterring many from returning to work.\n\n24%\n\nThose who say government aid packages during the pandemic incentivized them to not actively look for work\n\n21%\n\nThose who say they never expect to be back to work full time\n\nSource: U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nEnhanced unemployment insurance and pandemic relief checks helped facilitate historic savings during the pandemic—as did the limited options for spending those savings as many normal spending options were unavailable, or significantly limited. Although those savings are coming down, in total, Americans saved about $2.7 trillion during the pandemic, 10% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nHistorically, layoffs and health emergencies stress Americans’ bank accounts and unemployed workers are eager to return to a steady paycheck. But during the pandemic, savings accounts broke with tradition and rose to unprecedented levels.\n\n$2.7 trillion\n\nThe amount Americans saved during pandemic, equal to 10% of the nation’s GDP\n\nDespite savings dwindling, labor force participation has not gone up\n\nMany Americans were able to live off the money they’d put aside, postponing a return to work. Now, more than a year out from pandemic checks and enhanced benefits, Americans are seeing their saving account dwindle with prices rising and spending on necessities resuming. But despite savings levels coming down, there has not been a substantial increase in the nation’s labor force participation.\n\nThe labor force participation rate still lags around one percentage point below where it was at the start of the pandemic, meaning nearly three million workers are still missing from the workforce.\n\nAlthough there are other barriers keeping Americans out of work, like access to childcare, navigating the loss of government benefits when earnings or savings increase is a contributing factor keeping Americans out of work right now.\n\nNavigating a loss in government benefits\n\nMost states provide 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. During that time, unemployed individuals are required to look for suitable employment and are often matched with reemployment services. Not all claimants find work by the time their UI benefits end, however. In these cases, additional government programs become critical.\n\nState and federal government benefit programs are available to assuage some difficult financial situations for low-income families and individuals. Benefits are administered at the state and federal level and most often are targeted toward a certain expense—food, care, and housing.\n\nA majority (70%) of public benefits go to non-elderly people who work, and more than half of all workers in the bottom 20% of the wage distribution receive public benefits.\n\n41 million\n\nPeople receiving SNAP benefits in 2021\n\n1 million\n\nFamilies receiving TANF benefits in 2020\n\n80.5 million\n\nPeople enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2021\n\n2.2 million+\n\nFamilies receiving housing choice vouchers in 2021\n\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; County Health Executives Association of California; The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nWhile many programs operate on a sliding scale, gradually phasing out as income rises (like SNAP benefits), some programs are terminated at the onset of increased earnings or accrued savings.\n\n$10,326\n\nAnnual value of Medicaid benefits when earned income reaches $11,000\n\n$7,552\n\nValue loss of annual SNAP benefits when income reaches $35,000\n\nThe sliding scale and income thresholds lead to what is known as the “benefits cliff”—the point at which benefits are cut off. In some situations, the increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits. For this reason, some recipients are deterred from obtaining employment, working additional hours, or pursuing promotions and career development.\n\nThe two charts below from a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation describe the effect and severity of benefit cliffs.\n\nTake for example, public assistance in Durham County, North Carolina. Bundled public benefits decrease as earnings increase. However, if wages increase from $11,000 to $27,000 the family will experience a gap in health coverage between Medicaid and American Care Act subsidies because North Carolina is a non-expansion state for Medicaid.\n\n""Qualitative research reveals important insights about how employees navigate benefits cliffs,"" says Mathieu Despard, Ph.D., MSW. ""A 2016 study of benefit recipients in Cincinnati found that none of the recipients made a job or career decision based on impending benefits cliffs. Instead, these workers said they needed help in making the transition from public benefits to wage gains, such as budgeting for food amidst a loss in SNAP benefits, and that they felt worse off financially despite wage gains. Though workers preferred not to receive public benefits, they felt unprepared in losing these benefits.""\n\nA current snapshot of American’s financial wellness\n\nThe impact of benefits cliffs are especially relevant when considering the current financial wellness of Americans. With prices rising and pandemic savings dwindling, navigating benefits is more important than ever.\n\nDebt levels are beginning to rise again\n\nDebt levels declined during the pandemic, especially credit card debt. The drop in debt and rise in savings put consumers’ personal balance sheets in a strong position. However, debt levels are starting to rise as prices rise because of high inflation, the end of government pandemic benefits, and an increase in spending now that pandemic restrictions are mostly over.\n\nFurther, many did not pay their rent or mortgages during the pandemic. That moratorium is over which means they now need to make these large payments. With savings accounts no longer growing, prices rising, and spending on necessities resuming, Americans will see rising levels of debt as interest rates are climbing.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, overall debt levels have increased by 5.4%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Credit card debt, however, decreased during the same timeframe. In 2021, Americans acquired mortgages, car payments, and personal loans while paying down credit cards.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that a majority (61%) of American consumers are living paycheck to paycheck. While this standard financial lifestyle is most common among those who earn the least, living paycheck to paycheck exists across all income levels. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are precariously close to financial distress should an emergency occur.\n\n61%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\n\n79.9%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn less than $50k\n\n63.8%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn $50k-$100k\n\n42.2%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn more than $100k\n\nA proper social net should encourage and enable labor market entry, financial stability, and economic mobility. However, the steep benefit cliffs discourage labor market participation and promotion.\n\nChanging the current framework would allow employers to fill open jobs and maximize productivity while also ensuring beneficiaries can reach self-sufficiency, build assets, and increase net worth. Policy changes that help achieve this balance include raising income limits, phasing out benefits more gradually, implementing continuous enrollment and transitional benefits, and eliminating asset tests.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

In September, the Biden administration granted Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who have arrived in the U.S. since July 31. But getting migrants’ work permits approved is taking longer than the Andersonville and Lincoln Square Ravenswood chambers would like. Businesses can’t legally hire migrants until the paperwork is processed and approved.\n\n“We’re asking for folks to speed it up,” said Oakes, who has been talking with Representative Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) about securing more work permits.\n\nThe chambers said they haven’t heard about many businesses successfully hiring new migrants. Both chambers pointed out that this could still be happening, but Oakes said that the federal government’s application approvals have been “extremely slow.”\n\nAlderman Matt Martin’s 47th ward includes parts of Andersonville, Lincoln Square, and Ravenswood, and his office has collaborated with the chambers to support migrants who recently arrived. His office told ChicagoGlobal that the application includes several hurdles that might be too difficult for migrants to clear.\n\nApplications for work permits cost more than $500 for most adults. Waiving this fee requires filling out an application in English and mailing it to Washington, D.C., according to Martin’s office.\n\nThe chambers organize job fairs and have worked with nonprofits that help with job placements for refugees, including migrants who have applied for asylum. But without work permits, it’s not clear how many recent arrivals could benefit from these services.\n\nIn the meantime, Oakes says, local block clubs are hiring migrants – usually for yard work in cash – to help support them.\n\nIn the long run, Tobin hopes that migrants can help relieve the labor shortage in Lincoln Square and Ravenswood.\n\n“Writ large in Chicago, we’re seeing a labor shortage in hospitality, food production, health care, transportation. And these are people that could be employed to help fill the gap in those fields,” Tobin said.\n\nTransitioning to winter\n\nAs the weather turns colder, Chicago is adapting its migrant response to prepare for winter. Plans include building temporary tent shelters for migrants. On October 19, Alderwoman Julia Ramirez and an aide were surrounded and allegedly assaulted by protesters upset with the city’s plan to open a tent camp for migrants in Brighton Park.\n\nNeither the Andersonville chamber nor the Lincoln Square Ravenswood chamber said they have heard complaints about migrants from their members. So far, he’s only heard from businesses that want to “actively engage” and help provide material and financial support to migrants.\n\nHollenbeck says that shoppers in Andersonville “want to know that they are making a difference with their dollar.”\n\n“I think it’s really easy to feel hopeless and disillusioned and helpless,” said Hollenbeck. But, she says, donating helps her fight back against those feelings.\n\n“The least we can do,” Rabinowitz said, is “offer them compassion and support as a human.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://chicagocrusader.com/state-of-illinois-announces-8-4-million-grants-for-communities/', 'Headline': 'State Of Illinois announces $8.4 million grants for communities', 'Snippet': '12:36 pm.

The final round of Rebuild Distressed Communities (RDC) provides $976,000 to 26 small businesses and $7.45 million to help revitalize seven commercial corridors located across the state.\n\n“A strong pandemic economic recovery includes recognizing that some communities have long been denied their fair share of resources,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Through the Rebuild Distressed Communities program, we are delivering $8.4 million in direct grants to over two dozen small businesses and multiple regional economic corridors to build on the impact of our $250 million Back to Business program with an equitable lens.”\n\n“The Rebuild Distressed Communities program is another way for our state to recover, heal, and grow together,” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “Our administration is committed to economic development that uplifts all of us, and putting our state’s small businesses and vulnerable communities at the forefront through this funding is how we expand equity and opportunity across Illinois.”\n\nThe RDC program was launched last year by the State of Illinois to help businesses and communities rebuild from civil unrest. In addition to awarding grants to help impacted small business repair damages and rebuild or expand, the program also requested proposals from communities seeking to deliver long-term improvements along commercial corridors where businesses experienced damages during civil unrest. Overall, the RDC program will deploy a total $9.2 million, including 58 small business grants announced earlier this year.\n\n“Under Governor Pritzker’s leadership, DCEO is committed to leveraging our federal and state resources to help small businesses and communities hardest hit build back better in the wake of the pandemic,” said DCEO Acting Director Sylvia I. Garcia. “The investments made in this latest round of funding are two fold, helping small businesses repair immediate damages, while also making capital improvements in communities that will bring back foot traffic to commercial corridors and boost economic vitality.”\n\nThe State of Illinois worked with grant administrators LISC Chicago and the Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives to select applicants to receive funding. Working with these local partners, DCEO developed a process to connect small businesses with qualified contractors. The program prioritized local and Business Enterprise Program (BEP) contractors to ensure that job opportunities created by performing repairs and improvements went to those based in communities impacted by unrest.\n\n“LISC is honored to partner with the State to help Illinois’ small businesses get back on their feet,” said Meghan Harte, Executive Director of LISC Chicago. “The COVID-19 pandemic has already devastated small businesses across the state, undoing generations of economic and entrepreneurial equity that had been built up in our communities. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our neighborhoods, and the heartbreaking destruction experienced across Illinois in the summer of 2020 hurt small businesses the most. However, our state’s small businesses are resilient, and we are proud to support them as they rebuild.”\n\n“CNI is proud to work with Governor Pritzker to help minority residents and businesses gain access to statewide repair and construction opportunities,” said David Doig, President of CNI. “This has helped them compete and succeed in today’s economy while making repairs and improvements to the commercial corridors that grow small businesses and create the jobs and amenities which our communities rely upon. It’s been a privilege to partner with the State of IL, LISC, and the other organizations to advance these critically important objectives.”\n\nFunding awarded to small businesses will pave the way for an array of repairs as well as new construction projects to enhance the viability of local businesses and the communities they serve. Grants will help cover the cost of reimbursement for damages, insurance deductibles, and construction work related to repairs as a result of civil unrest. The entire list of business grantees are available on DCEO’s website, linked here.\n\nIn addition to the small business grants, RDC grants include funding for seven community projects focused on boosting economic vitality in commercial corridors across the state. The commercial corridor projects are:\n\nBack of the Yards Neighborhood Council $1,498,750 (affordable housing and commercial space),\n\n• City of Aurora, $1,200,000 (corridor enhancements)\n\n• City of East St. Louis, $900,000 (corridor enhancements)\n\n• City of Peoria, $1,200,000 (streetscape)\n\n• South East Chicago Chamber of Commerce, $1,450,000 (fiber optic cable enhancement)\n\n• West Humboldt Park Development Council, $300,000 (corridor enhancements)\n\n• City of Markham $900,000 (corridor enhancements)\n\n“East St. Louis is excited to utilize the funding provided by this program to repaint the narrative of our community,” Mayor Robert Eastern III, City of East St. Louis. “This resource will be used to expand our efforts to enhance lighting along city streets and to provide new security cameras in one of the city’s busiest and most vibrant corridor, the State Street business district.”\n\n“During the civil unrest that unfolded in the summer of 2020, 85 businesses and organizations throughout the City of Aurora were the victims of burglaries, criminal damage, and arsons,” said Aurora Police Chief Keith Cross. “This grant will allow us to protect our businesses, residents and visitors into the future and will provide real-time information that will help direct the daily response of our public safety personnel.”\n\nApplications for corridor projects were reviewed and evaluated according to the extent of property damage due to civil unrest, with program priorities being projects that were located in distressed communities, had geographic diversity around the state, and an investment impact that will build resiliency and revitalize the business corridor. In order to qualify for funds, project proposals were required to demonstrate the project would occur within the same block that experienced property damage or on contiguous blocks if required for project continuity. Funds for the RDC program are from the state’s historic $45 billion Rebuild Illinois Capital Program.\n\n“The 4600 block of Ashland Avenue has been adversely impacted for decades by the lack of investment in the retail corridor. The result of the civil unrest in June of 2020 further exacerbated an already bad situation, leaving much of the block in physical disarray,” said Craig Chico, President & CEO of Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council. “The Rebuild Distressed Communities Grant is creating an opportunity to not only rebuild from those devastating unrest, but this will allow us to build for the future by investing in affordable housing, community, and commercial activities. The entire retail corridor will benefit from this development 4636 South Ashland, which would’ve not occurred without this State Grant.”\n\nProjects for corridor improvements will repair and improve the surrounding area while increasing economic opportunities for impacted businesses. The projects were evaluated based on project need, capacity, quality, and societal impact.\n\n“The City of Markham Small Business District will have the benefit of added safety and security through the RDC corridor revitalization funds,” said Roger A. Agpawa, Mayor for the City of Markham. “This investment will allow us to protect this corridor with cameras and programmable smart signage, helping us deliver additional services to local businesses and the community.”\n\n“Thank you, Governor Pritzker. Amid the challenges of the pandemic, RDC funding has allowed us to restore multiple locations throughout Chicago,” said Michael Donaldson, Owner of NoContract Inc., a chain of cellphone retail stores. “This program provided the opportunity to reopen storefronts, keep workers employed, and offer telecommunication services in the areas we operate, the Southside of Chicago.”\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the Pritzker administration has led with a swift response to the economic impacts facing businesses and communities across the state. To date, over $1.5 billion in assistance has been provided by DCEO alone – including over 9,000 small business grants, workforce training grants, capital improvements, and other forms of community assistance.\n\nCurrently, DCEO is accepting applications for additional capital dollars aimed at revitalizing commercial areas in communities across the state. The recently launched Rebuild Illinois Main Street and Downtown program will provide up to $50 million in grants for construction, repair and modernization of public infrastructure and amenities to boost jobs, improve quality of life and stimulate economic activity for areas hit hardest during COVID-19. The deadline to apply is today, January 10, 2022.'}}",92.5,1

Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/jan-6-capitol-riot-suspects-viral-one-year-later-100001248.html', 'Headline': ""They went viral on Jan. 6.

See how in this 3D explainer from Yahoo Immersive.\n\nThose were just some of the images that went viral on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building as Congress was certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nFive people died in connection to the attack, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber, and a Capitol Police officer who died from a stroke one day after being pepper-sprayed during the riot. More than 140 other police officers were injured defending the Capitol, four of whom have since taken their own lives.\n\nAccording to the FBI, more than 725 people have been criminally charged — including those who went viral — and more are expected to be arrested.\n\nHere is what the people in those viral images were charged with, and where the cases against them stand, nearly a year since the deadly insurrection.\n\nThe QAnon Shaman (Jacob Chansley)\n\nOf the countless images that emerged from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, few have been more indelible than those featuring Jacob Chansley — the shirtless, spear-toting man seen storming the halls of Congress in a horned, fur headdress, his face painted red, white and blue.\n\nChansley, better known as the QAnon Shaman, was among the first group of rioters to enter the Capitol while the election certification was under way. According to prosecutors, once inside the building, Chansley used a bullhorn “to rile up the crowd and demand that lawmakers be brought out,” before making his way into the Senate chamber. He was photographed sitting in Vice President Mike Pence’s chair on the Senate dais, where, prosecutors said, he left a note that read: “It’s Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!”\n\nPhotos of 34-year-old Chansley were among the first to circulate on social media as rioters ransacked the Capitol; some Trump allies soon tried to use them as proof that antifa leftists were responsible for the violence, rather than the president’s own supporters. But such claims were easily debunked, in part because Chansley’s distinct tattoos and unmistakable getup were quickly recognized from various right-wing political rallies in Arizona over the previous year where Chansley, a prominent promoter of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory group, had been a regular fixture. It was later reported that he had served in the U.S. Navy from 2005 to 2007.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, Chansley called the FBI’s Washington field office on Jan. 7 and confirmed that he was, in fact, the man in the face paint and horns seen during the Capitol attack. He said he’d traveled from Arizona at the request of Trump, who urged all “patriots” to go to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 to protest the certification of the Electoral College results. Two days later, he was taken into custody and charged with obstruction, civil disorder, demonstrating in a Capitol building, and violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building.\n\nChansley has remained behind bars throughout his court proceedings, but that hasn’t kept him out of the spotlight. He made headlines by demanding to be served organic meals in jail and then sat for an interview with “60 Minutes” in March in which he said his actions on Jan. 6 were not an attack but an attempt “to bring God back into the Senate.” His attorney, Al Watkins, also gave a number of high-profile interviews in the days after Chansley\'s arrest, insisting that his client’s behavior during the riot was “peaceful” and that Trump was to blame for his presence at the Capitol, calling on the outgoing president to pardon Chansley and other supporters who’d since been arrested. When no pardon came, Watkins said Chansley would be willing to testify against the former president during his second impeachment trial.\n\n[Poll: Share of Trump voters who believe Biden \'won fair and square\' falls to 9%]\n\nChansley’s attitude appears to have evolved significantly over the last several months, much of which he spent in solitary confinement. In September, he agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of obstructing an official proceeding. At his sentencing hearing at the federal district court in Washington in November, he apologized for his role in the Capitol attack in a lengthy speech that featured quotes from Jesus and Gandhi and references to the popular 1994 film “The Shawshank Redemption,” a prison drama.\n\nThough Judge Royce Lamberth praised Chansley’s comments, telling him, ""I think you are genuine in your remorse and heartfelt,"" he denied Watkins’s request to sentence Chansley to time served.\n\n“What you did is terrible,” Lamberth told Chansley before sentencing him to 41 months, or roughly three and a half years, in prison. At the time, Chansley’s sentence was tied for the harshest handed down so far in connection with the Jan. 6 riot (that title is now held by the 63-month prison term given to Robert Palmer — more on him below).\n\nAfter all, Lamberth said, Chansley ""made himself the image of the riot.”\n\nDespite telling the judge he wanted to take accountability for his actions, Chansley has since hired new lawyers and filed a notice of appeal, seeking to overturn his conviction and prison sentence. It was not immediately clear on what grounds the appeal will be based, but Chansley’s options are limited under the conditions of his plea agreement. His new lawyers — one of whom briefly represented Kyle Rittenhouse — have suggested they may pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Watkins, Chansley’s former attorney.\n\nChansley’s new attorney, John Pierce, declined a request for comment from Yahoo News.\n\nIn an email to Yahoo News, Watkins confirmed that he is no longer representing Chansley, writing, “as such, I am not in a position to comment on his case.”\n\n“Mr. Chansley is a very gentle, intelligent and kind man,” Watkins’s email continued. “I sincerely wish him all the best in his life.”\n\nThe suspect with the fire extinguisher (Robert Palmer)\n\nIn the days and weeks after Jan. 6, video footage continued to emerge from the Capitol that, along with firsthand accounts from police officers who were at the scene, painted a clearer picture of the brutality encountered by law enforcement that day. It soon became evident that one of the most violent clashes between police and members of the pro-Trump mob took place near the Lower West Terrace entrance to the Capitol, where rioters were seen dragging two officers into the crowd and beating them with an array of objects, including metal pipes, barricades, fire extinguishers and flagpoles, in what one Capitol Police officer later described as “something out of a medieval battle.”\n\nAmong those involved in the hours-long melee on the Lower West Terrace was 54-year-old Robert Palmer of Largo, Fla. According to prosecutors, Palmer made his way to the Capitol on Jan. 6 after attending Trump’s rally near the White House earlier that afternoon. Visible in an American flag jacket and a red “Florida for Trump” hat, Palmer can be seen in a variety of photos and videos of the mob, which prosecutors used to trace his movements at the Capitol.\n\nAccording to court records, Palmer was initially spotted around 4 p.m. leaning over a railing on the Capitol’s Upper West Terrace, where he held a sign that read “Biden is a pedophile” and cheered on the mob attacking police on the terrace below. Palmer observed the fighting from above for about 50 minutes before making his way down to the Lower West Terrace, where, prosecutors said, he threw a wooden plank at officers, hitting a riot shield. He then proceeded to move further into the heart of the battle, joining the front line of rioters attacking police who were attempting to block access to a tunnel leading from the terrace into the building. Video footage captured Palmer spraying a fire extinguisher at the officers at close range and then hurling the empty canister at them twice, along with an orange traffic barrier.\n\nAfter the crowd had been cleared from the terrace, Palmer and others continued to confront police on the plaza below, where at approximately 5:15 p.m. he obtained a 4- to 5-foot pole. After ignoring warnings from Virginia State Police officers to drop the pole, prosecutors said, Palmer began screaming obscenities and “threw the pole like a spear at the officers,” prompting a state trooper to fire a rubber bullet, hitting Palmer in the stomach. After a few minutes on the ground, video footage documents Palmer walking around showing off a bruise.\n\n“Attempting to portray himself as the victim rather than the aggressor, Palmer pointed at his abdomen, shouting, ‘This is the United States. This is what our country is doing to its citizens,’” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo. Although no specific police injury was tied to Palmer’s conduct at the Capitol, prosecutors said that based on the size and weight of the plank and fire extinguisher, and the speed and force with which Palmer threw them, the objects were capable of inflicting serious bodily injury.\n\nDespite all the footage of Palmer’s actions on Jan. 6, he was not arrested for his role in the riot until March 17, after he was identified by an online sleuth and named publicly in an article by HuffPost. In the piece, Palmer claimed he “didn’t do anything wrong” at the Capitol. On Oct. 4, however, he pleaded guilty to assaulting, resisting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon, and last month he was sentenced to 63 months, or more than five years, in federal prison — the longest sentence to date resulting from the criminal investigation of the Jan. 6 attack. He was the first Capitol defendant to be sentenced on the charge of assaulting officers using a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\n[Jan. 6 Capitol riot: One year later, key numbers to know]\n\nPalmer attempted to express remorse for his actions ahead of his sentencing, which, under his original plea agreement, called for a prison term ranging from 46 to 57 months.\n\n“I realize that we, meaning Trump supporters, were lied to by those that at the time who had great power, meaning the sitting president as well as those acting on his behalf,” Palmer wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan last month.\n\nAt his sentencing hearing he told the judge that while he was in jail, he watched footage of himself on Jan. 6 on an MSNBC news segment and was “horrified, absolutely devastated to see myself on there.”\n\n“I’m really, really ashamed of what I did,” Palmer said.\n\nWhile federal prosecutors acknowledged in their sentencing memo that Palmer should get credit for turning himself in and cooperating with the FBI, they also argued that his statements “both on January 6 and up to the present,” even after his guilty plea, “suggest a distinct lack of remorse for his conduct, a tenuous relationship with truth, and a willingness to repeat falsehoods for personal benefit.”\n\nIn particular, prosecutors pointed to an online fundraiser for Palmer’s legal defense that had been created at his direction, after he’d pleaded guilty and been taken to jail in D.C., in which he claimed he did “go on the defense and throw a fire extinguisher at the police” only after being shot with tear gas and rubber bullets. Prosecutors argued that this statement, which Palmer later admitted in court was a lie, reflected a failure to accept responsibility for his actions, and Chutkan agreed, increasing the range of his sentence to 63 to 78 months.\n\n“I don’t know if your remorse now is genuine or not,” Chuktan said before handing down the sentence. “It sounds like it is. Your actions after your plea undercut that argument.”\n\n“The men and women who kept democracy functioning that day, and saved lives, they deserve the thanks of the nation,” the judge told Palmer. “They didn’t deserve to have fire extinguishers thrown at them; they didn’t deserve to be spat on. Perhaps, having seen yourself on videotape and media coverage, you understand how terrified the rest of this country must have been.”\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News, Palmer’s attorney, Bjorn Brunvand, said there’s “no doubt” his client’s online fundraising request “had detrimental effect on his ultimate sentence.” But, Brunvand continued, “I think he’s remorseful regardless of what was said during that attempt at fundraising,” adding that Palmer “immediately refunded the money and removed the post.”\n\n“I think he did that at a moment when he was feeling really down and desperate,” he said.\n\nBrunvand also told Yahoo News that while Palmer received a “strong sentence,” it “certainly could’ve been a lot worse,” noting that his client had been facing up to 20 years in prison for Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nPalmer, he said, is still being held at the D.C. jail while awaiting a transfer to a federal Bureau of Prisons facility, where he’ll begin serving his sentence.\n\nThe man who put his feet up in Pelosi’s office (Richard Barnett)\n\nAs hundreds of Trump supporters swarmed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Richard Barnett, 61, of Gravette, Ark., was photographed inside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office, smiling with his feet up on a desk, an American flag draped across a nearby credenza, a stun gun visible in his pants. Unsurprisingly, the images were widely shared.\n\nBarnett emerged from the Capitol with a personalized envelope he took from Pelosi’s office, insisting to a New York Times reporter that he didn\'t steal it.\n\n“I left a quarter on her desk,” Barnett said, ""even though she ain’t f***ing worth it.”\n\nHe also left a note for her, using an expletive to refer to the speaker.\n\nTwo days later, Barnett was taken into custody near his northwest Arkansas home and charged with numerous offenses, including disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, theft of government property, entering and remaining in a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\nUnder federal sentencing guidelines, Barnett faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.\n\nDuring a March hearing, Barnett screamed at the judge for detaining him. He was released in April and ordered to wear an ankle monitor, turn over his passport and not leave his home. He is currently awaiting trial.\n\nHis attorney, Joseph McBride, did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn June, Barnett began selling signed copies of the photo of him inside Pelosi’s office for $100 to help pay his legal fees.\n\n“Richard Barnett\'s picture at Speaker Pelosi’s desk has become the face of the new anti-federalist movement,” a note on a fundraising website reads. “We will not go gently into that good night.”\n\nLast month, Barnett gave an interview to a local television station, saying he felt his actions on Jan. 6 were justified.\n\n“I think more than anything I just wanted to feel like I was closer to the seat of power,” he said.\n\n“When you’re talking about the type of charges many of us got filed against us and the extremes they’ve gone to, it’s out of the ordinary,” he continued. “It’s not normal.”\n\n“At that time I was shocked,” Barnett said of his jail stint. “I mean, now, a lot of time has passed, and in retrospect you go, ‘Wow, is this what our country is really all about?’”\n\n“As far as apologies or regret, no comment,” he added. “You can pretty much guess how I feel, but I can’t comment on it.”\n\nThe man who stole Pelosi\'s lectern (Adam Johnson)\n\nAnother Capitol rioter who achieved viral fame was Adam Johnson, a 36-year-old from Florida who was seen in a knit Trump hat smiling and waving to photographers as he dragged Pelosi\'s lectern through the Capitol Rotunda. (The lectern was reported missing but found the next day in a hallway on the Senate side of the Capitol.)\n\nJohnson subsequently posted to Facebook a different photo of himself taken inside the Capitol that day, and a caller to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center tip line said they recognized him in the viral image because they shared a mutual friend.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Johnson was arrested near his home in Parrish, Fla., and charged with three counts: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of government property.\n\nJohnson initially pleaded not guilty. Shortly after his arrest, his attorneys, David Bigney and Dan Eckhart, insisted their client simply got swept up in the moment.\n\n“He is a family man,” Eckhart told CNN. “His wife is a physician. He has five children. There is nothing in his background or his past that would attribute any type of violence or this type of rebellious behavior to him. It is an anomaly, an unusual situation for him.”\n\n""He wasn\'t involved in any coup,"" Bigney added. “Things got out of hand. You saw the pictures. He was not there for any destruction, any treason. He was just there to witness history.”\n\nBut late last month, Johnson agreed to plead guilty to one count — entering or remaining in a restricted building — which carries a maximum of up to one year in prison and a fine of $100,000. Johnson, though, is expected to receive less than six months in prison, and as part of his plea, he will pay $500 to the architect of the Capitol.\n\nHe is due to be sentenced on Feb. 25.\n\nThe man in the ""Camp Auschwitz"" hoodie (Robert Keith Packer)\n\nIn another widely circulated photo taken during the riot, several Trump supporters are depicted in a corridor holding a shard of a broken sign with Pelosi’s name on it. To their right is a man wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “Camp Auschwitz,” a reference to the network of extermination camps run by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Underneath those words is an image of a human skull and the phrase “Work brings freedom.” (That is the approximate English translation of a sign on Auschwitz\'s gate reading ""Arbeit macht frei."")\n\nThe man, identified as Robert Keith Packer, 57, of Virginia, was arrested near his home on Jan. 13. According to a criminal complaint, a store owner in Newport News, Va., recognized Packer as a customer and contacted law enforcement. Surveillance cameras at the store captured Packer about a month before the siege wearing the same “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt, and authorities used that information to help identify and locate him.\n\nPacker was charged with two counts: entering and remaining in a restricted building, and violent entry and disorderly conduct and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. He pleaded not guilty and was released on a personal recognizance bond on the condition that he stay away from Washington, D.C.\n\nPelosi has rarely singled out any of the Capitol rioters when discussing the events of Jan. 6. But she admitted that she couldn’t help but be overcome with anger when she saw Packer in his “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt.\n\n“To see this punk with that shirt on,” Pelosi said during her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill a week after the insurrection, “and his anti-Semitism that he has bragged about, to be a part of this white supremacist raid on this Capitol requires us to have an after-action review to assign responsibility to those who were part of organizing it and incentivizing it.”\n\nIn August, Packer was offered a plea deal by the Justice Department, part of an effort to resolve lower-level cases stemming from the attack. Federal prosecutors didn\'t provide details about the offer during a brief hearing that month, but other rioters who have been charged with nonviolent offenses have been offered similar plea deals — many ending with jail sentences of six months or less.\n\nBut Packer has yet to accept the offer.\n\nThe Confederate flag suspect (Kevin Seefried)\n\nKevin Seefried, 51, came to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 with his 23-year-old son Hunter to hear Trump speak. He brought with him a Confederate battle flag that he normally displays outside his home in Wilmington, Del.\n\nSeefried and his son were among those who participated in the march from the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Ellipse to the Capitol, which was “led by an individual with a bullhorn,” according to court documents.\n\nVideo footage showed the two men entering the Senate building through a window that Hunter helped break at 2:13 p.m. ET, according to the FBI.\n\nA short time later, Kevin Seefried was photographed carrying a Confederate battle flag through the halls of the Capitol, past a portrait of Charles Sumner, an abolitionist senator from Massachusetts during the Civil War.\n\nIt was a visceral image that drew immediate anger, particularly among historians who found the juxtaposition jarring.\n\n“The Confederate flag made it deeper into Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, than it did during the Civil War,” William Blair, professor emeritus of history at Penn State, later told the New York Times.\n\nOnce inside, Kevin and Hunter Seefried were part of a large group that “verbally confronted” several Capitol Police officers, court documents say. Hunter was also seen in video footage taking a selfie.\n\nAccording to the documents, Kevin Seefried was identified after a co-worker of Hunter Seefried\'s told the FBI that he had bragged about being inside the Capitol with his father that day.\n\nThe father and son were both arrested in Delaware on Jan. 14 and charged with five counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n\nHunter Seefried was indicted on three additional counts: knowingly engaging in an act of physical violence against property, destruction of government property, and violence within the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThey each pleaded not guilty to all counts, and a June 15 trial date has been set.\n\nThe ‘zip-tie guy’ (Eric Gavelek Munchel)\n\nAmong the more chilling images to surface from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 is a photograph of a man in black tactical gear climbing over seats in the Senate chamber with a fist full of white flex cuffs, or zip ties. His face was almost entirely covered by a black, balaclava-style ski mask under a black baseball cap, but it seemed clear almost immediately that the man in this photo, who would soon be dubbed “zip-tie guy” on social media, was not a law enforcement officer responding to the breach of the Capitol but a member of the mob. Before the “zip-tie guy” had even been identified, some counterterrorism experts speculated that the flex cuffs seen in the photograph might be indicative of a plot by rioters to hold politicians hostage.\n\nAfter the riot, social media sleuths helped the FBI identify the man as 30-year-old Eric Gavelek Munchel of Nashville. Eleven days after the breach of the Capitol, federal prosecutors in Washington filed a criminal complaint with an arrest warrant for Munchel as well as his mother, Atlanta-area nurse Lisa Marie Eisenhart, who, they said, was seen alongside Munchel in several photos and videos taken inside the Capitol complex on Jan. 6.\n\nMunchel and Eisenhart were both initially indicted on charges of entering a restricted building or grounds, obstructing an official proceeding, and violent entry or disorderly conduct for their alleged activities during the insurrection. But in June, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment, charging the pair with eight total counts, including carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon inside the U.S. Capitol. The weapon in question was a Taser, which prosecutors have said Munchel was carrying in a holster on his camouflage pants. Both Munchel and Eisenhart have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nOther evidence cited by the Justice Department includes interviews that Munchel and Eisenhart gave to the Times of London in the immediate aftermath of the attack, as well as footage obtained from Munchel’s cellphone, which he wore mounted on his vest during the riot. Among the key moments prosecutors say were captured in that Jan. 6 recording is the one in which Munchel found the plastic handcuffs, or zip ties, that made him go viral.\n\n“At one point, Munchel spots plastic handcuffs on a table inside a hallway in the Capitol,” attorneys with the DOJ wrote in a pretrial detention memo in January. “Munchel exclaims, ‘Zipties. I need to get me some of them [expletive],’ and grabs several white plastic handcuffs from on top of a cabinet.”\n\nProsecutors said Munchel’s cellphone footage also captured a conversation between the mother-son duo in which they decided to stash unspecified “weapons” in a backpack outside the Capitol before entering the building.\n\nMunchel and Eisenhart were jailed for two months without bond after their initial arrests, but in March, Judge Royce Lamberth — the same D.C. District Court judge who oversaw Jacob Chansley’s case — ordered both of them to be released on bond and placed on house arrest with GPS monitoring.\n\nMunchel was originally placed under the supervision of a friend who allowed him to sleep on the couch of her Nashville apartment before kicking him out, prompting prosecutors to accuse him of violating his bond conditions. In a court filing, Justice Department lawyers asked the judge to place Munchel in the custody of his older brother and to prohibit him from consuming alcohol, arguing that his behavior contributed to his prior eviction.\n\n[The unanswered questions about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot]\n\nAs with other Jan. 6 defendants, Munchel’s lawyer has blamed Trump for her client\'s participation in the insurrection at the Capitol. In a February court filing arguing that Munchel should be released from jail ahead of his trial, attorney Sandra Roland cited the former president’s efforts to discredit the outcome of the 2020 presidential election as motivation for Munchel’s actions on Jan. 6.\n\n“Beginning in 2020, parts of the United States government — first and foremost the President of the United States of America — told the public that the only way President Donald Trump could lose the presidential election was if the election was rigged,” Roland wrote. “After President Trump lost the election, he and other government officials aligned with him said the presidency had been stolen from him by widespread election fraud.”\n\nShe went on to write that that it wasn’t until Jan. 4 that Munchel “agreed to accompany his mother, Lisa Eisenhart, to President Trump’s ‘Save America’ rally to be held on January 6, 2021,” noting that Munchel is not affiliated with “any militant groups or hate groups or anti-government groups, or any groups who planned to do anything on January 6th beyond attending a rally to protest what they perceived as ‘the steal.’”\n\nRoland declined Yahoo News’ request for comment. An attorney representing Eisenhart did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set for either Munchel or Eisenhart.\n\nThe woman carrying ‘The children cry out for justice’ sign (Christine Priola)\n\nShe was hard to miss on Jan. 6: the woman in a red winter parka and MAGA-emblazoned pants with a sign reading “The children cry out for justice,” standing on the floor of the Senate chamber pointing her cellphone where Vice President Mike Pence had been standing minutes before.\n\nTwitter users quickly identified the woman as Christine Priola, a 49-year-old school occupational therapist from Cleveland. The FBI in Cleveland received an anonymous tip that she was employed by the Cleveland Metropolitan School District.\n\nPriola submitted her letter of resignation the day after she learned she was under investigation. In the letter, she cited three reasons for resignation, including beliefs that are in line with the QAnon conspiracy theories espoused by some Trump supporters who took part in the riot:\n\n1. I will not be taking the corona virus 19 vaccine in order to return to in person learning.\n\n2. I will be switching paths to expose the global evil of human trafficking and pedophilia, including in our government and children’s services agencies.\n\n3. I do not agree with my union dues which help fund people and groups that support the killing of unborn children.\n\n(Her third reason, it’s worth noting, highlighted the underreported link between the Capitol riot and anti-abortion extremism prevalent among supporters of QAnon.)\n\nThe school board accepted her resignation shortly after she submitted it, stating that while the board supported the right of any individual to peacefully protest, it condemned the actions taken by hundreds on Jan. 6.\n\n“The right of peaceful protest, as protected by the First Amendment, is a foundation of our democracy,” a spokeswoman for the school board said in a statement. “The forcible takeover and willful destruction of our government is not.”\n\nA day later, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Priola’s Willoughby, Ohio, home, where they recovered a laptop, two desktop computers, several thumb drives and an iPhone, which was apparently wiped clean of data during the riot. However, agents were able to uncover location data from 4:23 p.m. that day, which according to Google Maps corresponded to a location just northeast of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPriola was arrested on Jan. 14 and charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and unlawful activities on Capitol grounds, parades, assemblages and display of flags.\n\nShe was released on a $20,000 bond, subject to home detention and electronic home monitoring. (She arrived back at her home wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt with the slogan “Save our children” written on it.)\n\nPriola’s case has been granted numerous continuations, with the government citing the enormous volume of discovery in her case and in other Jan. 6 cases.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/capitol-rioter-photographed-pelosis-podium-jan-6-sentenced-prison-rcna17409', 'Headline': ""Capitol rioter photographed with Pelosi's podium on Jan. 6 sentenced to ..."", 'Snippet': 'Adam Johnson bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying Nancy Pelosi\'s lectern during the attack on the U.S. Capitol. ... where Ashli Babbitt was shot — to 75 days in prison.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — A Florida man who bragged he ""broke the internet"" when he was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s podium during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was sentenced to 75 days in prison on Friday.\n\nAdam Johnson, a stay-at-home father of five boys, traveled to D.C. in support of former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to President Joe Biden. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton sentenced Johnson to prison on Friday, saying Johnson made ""a mockery"" of the events by grabbing Pelosi\'s lectern and played an active role in the attack. Walton said he just couldn\'t overlook Johnson\'s behavior, which he said was deserving of a period of incarceration. Johnson will get credit for some time he\'s already served, and will also pay a $5,000 fine.\n\n""We\'re on a dangerous slide in America,"" Walton said Friday, calling what happened on Jan. 6 something you\'d expect to ""see in banana republics."" Walton asked Johnson how he could hold himself out as a good role model for his five children when he came to D.C. and did what he did on Jan. 6.\n\nJohnson, speaking to the court on Friday, said he\'d been ""nothing but cooperative"" with the government since his arrest, and said his actions demonstrated that he was apologetic and was ""ashamed"" to have been a part of the Capitol riot.\n\nJohnson said he recognized that if he did what he did in another country, he\'d be ""on a firing wall instead of a courtroom."" He claimed he had no intent to harm Pelosi.\n\n""If I did find her, I would ask for a selfie with her, if anything,"" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson pleaded guilty to a criminal count of entering and remained in a restricted building or grounds, admitting that he unlawfully entered the Capitol after witnessing battles with police outside the building, and then grabbed Pelosi\'s podium ""because he believed it would make a good prop for a picture."" Johnson also admitted that he shouted that a bust of George Washington would be ""a great battering ram"" as rioters attempted to break into the floor of the U.S. House, where members of Congress were still present.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Arco told the court Friday that Johnson\'s conduct deserves prison time. She played a video of Johnson jiggling the door of what he thought was Pelosi\'s office. There can be no question, Arco said, that Johnson knew he was part of a violent mob.\n\n""Mr. Johnson was part of a mob,"" Arco said. ""He knew that.”\n\nJustice Department prosecutors argued in a memo ahead of his sentencing that Johnson\'s actions illustrated his ""sense of entitlement and privilege"" and that he appeared ""defiant and righteous in his trespassing, which he celebrated by posting this photo to Facebook."" Federal prosecutors had requested a sentence of 90 days behind bars.\n\nJohnson\'s attorneys claimed in their own filing that Johnson ""deeply regrets his participation in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6"" and that the ""damage and violence inflicted on that date by others is contrary to everything he believes in."" They argued that his five children would be negatively impacted by his imprisonment, and that Johnson received extra scrutiny because the lectern he grabbed belonged to the speaker of House.\n\n""Unfortunately, he received considerable attention simply because the lectern belonged to Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi,"" they wrote. ""Arguably, if he latched onto some other piece of government furniture for his photo opportunity jail time would not even be a consideration.""\n\nThe FBI has arrested more than 740 people in connection with the U.S. Capitol attack, out of more than 2,500 individuals who engaged in chargeable criminal conduct that day. Sentences have ranged from probationary sentences and fines for misdemeanor defendants to five years in federal prison for Robert Scott Palmer, who attacked officers with a fire extinguisher and received the longest sentence of any Capitol rioter so far.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/21/youtube-videos/ashli-babbitt-vs-antifa-video-falsely-claims-babbi/', 'Headline': '“Ashli Babbitt Tried To Stop Antifa False Flag On Jan 6th”', 'Snippet': 'In the year since Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot trying to force her way further inside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, a chorus of conservative voices have cast her as a ...', 'Full_text': 'In the year since Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot trying to force her way further inside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, a chorus of conservative voices have cast her as a patriot and a martyr, and her death as an unjust assassination.\n\nA new narrative circulating online takes those claims further. ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6,"" said the title of one video posted Jan. 19, 2022.\n\n""She was trying to stop those people from busting up the place, and then had to flee from them,"" the speaker in the video said. ""That’s why she went through the window, and then got shot, got assassinated by that f------- rent-a-cop.""\n\nThe video offered a conspiratorial retelling of what transpired during one of day’s most scrutinized moments, when Babbitt attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby, where lawmakers were being evacuated. It relied on an interpretation of Jan. 6 footage from a right-wing outlet that made unsubstantiated claims about Babbitt’s words, actions and frame of mind in the moments before she died.\n\nIn reality, there is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob — or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa.\n\nThe insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of them whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election. The officer who fired the bullet that killed Babbitt — Lt. Michael Byrd, a Capitol Police officer for 28 years — was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations.\n\nA video spread on YouTube and other platforms wrongly claimed Ashli Babbitt tried to stop an antifa false flag on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThis video spread widely anyway, racking up 200,000 views on YouTube and tens of thousands more on the alternative platforms like Rumble and Bitchute. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA litany of false and conspiratorial claims\n\nThe creator of the video is a self-described former Obama voter and special education teacher who now posts live-streams and other content under the persona ""the Salty Cracker.""\n\nHis website has a disclaimer at the bottom of his website that reads, ""These are the opinions and ramblings of a lunatic. They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nMany of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong:\n\nHe called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasn’t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.\n\nHe insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" That’s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.\n\nHe said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" That’s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.\n\nNo documented antifa presence\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speaker’s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""\n\nHere’s how he described what happened before her death:\n\n""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire. Donald Trump supporters trying to extinguish the false flag, and apparently Ashli Babbitt was one of these individuals, and we got it on tape … As she’s trying to stop them, then they start chasing her. So then she’s got to climb through. She can’t go backwards, so she’s got to go forward.""\n\nBut several rioters denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbitt’s shooting Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year designation.\n\nRELATED VIDEO\n\n""We have no cases of antifa in our database of individuals charged with breaking into the Capitol,"" said Roderick Cowan, the executive director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which maintains a database on the more than 700 people facing charges. ""Nor have we ever seen evidence of a named individual who supports antifa there.""\n\nAmong the rioters nearby when Babbitt died were Zachary Alam, the rioter wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat who smashed the windows to the Speaker’s Lobby that Babbitt later climbed through; Chad Barrett Jones, who helped bust the glass with a rolled-up Trump flag; and Thomas Baranyi, who wore a Trump-Pence hat and left the Capitol with Babbitt’s blood smeared on his hand.\n\nA speculative video analysis\n\nBut what about the pro-Trump mob? Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speaker’s Lobby, video shows.""\n\nThe article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbitt’s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speaker’s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didn’t heed the call.""\n\nThe article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges.\n\nThe Epoch Times’ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Don’t! Wait!""\n\nThose claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time.\n\nWhether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.\n\nOther footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But it’s not clear that she was confronting him.\n\nExperts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact it’s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivan’s video what Babbitt was saying. She’s far away from Sullivan’s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.\n\n""This is a classic ‘cocktail party effect’ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbitt’s voice from Sullivan’s video.\n\nOne rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (It’s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)\n\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP)\n\nThe Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt.\n\nHansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape.\n\nBut Hansen’s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Footage shows her not pinned but moving freely prior to the incident..\n\nOur ruling\n\nA YouTube video claimed, ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6.""\n\nThe video was posted by a creator whose website includes a disclaimer saying his opinions are meant ""for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nIn this case, the video’s central claim that Babbitt was fighting to thwart an antifa false flag is a ridiculous rewriting of what happened inside the Capitol. Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nThere was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mob’s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.\n\nWe rate this YouTube video Pants on Fire!'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/2829546/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a Martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was killed by a US Capitol police officer one year ago.\n\n“My daughter was an amazing, energetic, independent, powerful woman.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process. Most of them veterans, who fought for their right to be in this country, to exercise their First Amendment right to protest — and they are being denied the rights they fought for,” she said.\n\nAs Congress marked the anniversary with a moment of silence and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered speeches, a few supporters of the Jan. 6 effort gathered nearby.\n\nKeith Scott, who described himself as a proud Capitol rioter, traveled to DC from Corpus Christi, Texas, to observe the anniversary.\n\n“It was the greatest day of my life,” he said as he stood near the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the base of Capitol Hill.\n\n“I felt like a patriot – like a patriot before the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and I still feel that way.”\n\nBut he said he was disappointed the anniversary didn’t draw other supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n“Loyal Trump supporters are worn out,” he said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ashli-babbitt-jan-6-insurrectionist-portrayed-as-martyr-by-some-had-violent-past', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt, Jan. 6 insurrectionist portrayed as martyr by some ... - PBS', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nREAD MORE: Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house.

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/post-misrepresents-legal-power-of-arizona-resolution-on-electronic-voting-machines/', 'Headline': 'Post Misrepresents Legal Power of Arizona Resolution on Electronic ...', 'Snippet': ""The Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state.

The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

So he issued an order confirming the Arizona election, which Biden won with a 10,457-vote edge over Trump.\n\nFederal court case remains to be heard\n\nFriday’s ruling, however, is not the last word.\n\nWard, in anticipation of the case going against her, already had announced she plans to seek review by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAnd a separate lawsuit is playing out in federal court, which includes some of the same claims made here along with allegations of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThat case, set for a hearing Tuesday, also seeks to void the results of the presidential contest.\n\nIt includes allegations that the Dominion Software voting equipment used by Maricopa County is unreliable and was programmed to register more votes for Biden than he actually got.\n\nLegislative leaders call for audit but not to change election results\n\nAlong the same lines, Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the software and equipment used by Maricopa County in the just-completed election.\n\n“There have been questions,” Fann said.\n\nBut she told Capitol Media Services it is not their intent to use whatever is found to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election.\n\nIn fact, she said nothing in the Republican legislative leaders’ request for the inquiry alleges there are any “irregularities” in the way the election was conducted.\n\n“At the very least, the confidence in our electoral system has been shaken because of a lot of claims and allegations,” Fann said. “So our No. 1 goal is to restore the confidence of our voters.”\n\nBowers specifically rejected calls by the Trump legal team that the Legislature come into session to void the election results, which were formally certified on Monday.\n\n“The rule of law forbids us to do that,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Bowers pointed out, it was the Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted a law three years ago specifically requiring the state’s electors “to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide canvass.”\n\nHe said that was done because Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote nationwide in 2016 and some lawmakers feared that electors would refuse to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Trump, who won Arizona’s race that year.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in a prepared statement. “But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen. David Farnsworth was leading with 64% of the vote to Bowers\' 36% as of Wednesday morning, according to the Arizona secretary of state\'s office. Trump supported Farnsworth in the race, and blasted Bowers as a ""RINO coward"" at a rally last month.\n\nBowers testified on June 21 before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing focused on a plan by Trump\'s allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona.\n\nBowers resisted that effort, telling the committee that the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody.""\n\nEarlier this year, Bowers helped block a bill to empower the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted.\n\nBowers has been a Republican for 30 years. But ahead of a visit by Trump to Arizona in July, the state Republican Party voted to censure him. Kelli Ward, chair of the Arizona GOP, announced the condemnation by the panel on Twitter, saying Bowers is ""no longer a Republican in good standing & we call on Republicans to replace him at the ballot box in the August primary.""\n\nIn an interview ahead of Tuesday\'s primary, Bowers\' told CBS News\' Ed O\'Keefe said he had heard from people who called the censure ahead of a visit by Trump ""cheap theatrics.""

""It\'s not like it\'s a surprise.""\n\nBowers testified that after Trump and his allies made baseless claims of voter fraud in Arizona and called to put forward fake electors, Trump supporters began descending on his neighborhood and family, claiming he was a pedophile and a corrupt politician.\n\nHe said his family had begun to dread Saturdays, when the supporters descended on his neighborhood.\n\n""At the same time ... we had a daughter who was gravely ill, who was upset by what was happening outside and my wife — that is a valiant person, very strong, quiet, very strong woman,"" he said, growing emotional.

It would mandate, for instance, that election workers hand-count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nThe bill would “create a system where losers can set aside the will of the people,” said Alex Gulotta, who runs the Arizona chapter of the voting rights group All Voting is Local. “This is an all-out assault on the freedom to vote.”\n\nThe bill’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. John Fillmore, told CNN in a telephone interview that he’s trying to “ensure the integrity of the voting process.”\n\nUnder his proposal, lawmakers would meet to either “accept or reject election results” following primary and general elections. If legislators reject the results, any qualified voter “may file an action in the Superior Court to request that a new election be held,” according to the bill.\n\nFillmore said lawmakers should possess authority as “representatives of the people” to review the vote count. But, he said, “if there’s a problem, we’re not overturning anything. We’re just trying to put the skids on it and say, ‘This has to be adjudicated.’ “\n\nCurrently, in Arizona, the secretary of state certifies the statewide election results, which also are signed by the governor, state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also would eliminate the state’s widely used early voting-by-mail program and prohibit officials from requiring voters to wear masks at polling places.\n\nFifteen other lawmakers have cosponsored Fillmore’s bill, including state Rep. Mark Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed his bid to become Arizona’s election chief.\n\nFinchem did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\n“The fact that (Arizona lawmakers) are willing to put their names on these democracy-ending bills is a sign of where we’re going to go if we don’t, as a country, start speaking out against this stuff,” Gulotta said.\n\nArizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate last year commissioned an error-plagued hand count of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix.\n\nThe review, undertaken by a Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas, affirmed Biden’s win, but election officials widely discredited the company’s methods and most of its conclusions. The firm recently shut down.\n\nThe state will hold one of the marquee US Senate contests this year as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection to a full term. Kelly, one of the chamber’s most vulnerable incumbents, won a special election in 2020 to fill the seat once held by late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.\n\nIt’s not clear that Fillmore’s measure will gain traction in the legislature.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers, but by narrow margins. As a result, a handful of GOP defectors can sink legislation pushed by others in their party. Last year, a GOP proposal that would have allowed the state legislature to revoke presidential electors chosen through the popular vote and appoint its own slate failed.\n\nFillmore’s proposal – along with his recent remarks suggesting the state return to what he described as 1950s voting practices – sparked rebukes.\n\n“We need to get back to 1958-style of voting,” Fillmore said during a House committee meeting Wednesday – as he argued that voters should cast paper ballots, in person, on Election Day.\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, denounced the comments.\n\n“Republicans have started saying the quiet part out loud: their restrictive voting laws have nothing to do with promoting safe and accessible elections — they just want to drag us back to before the Civil Rights Movement,” Gabrielle Chew, the group’s vice president of communications, said in a statement.\n\nIn the interview with CNN, Fillmore said that by calling it a “1958 bill” he was describing the procedures he prefers, not an era. “In person, no electronics, on paper, count the ballots that day,” he added, ticking off his preferred voting rules.\n\nSo far this year, Arizona Republicans have introduced dozens of bills they say are needed to restore voter trust in elections.\n\nOne, approved by a House committee this week, would ban the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes. Another bill would create a new “bureau of elections” in the governor’s office with a $5 million budget and subpoena powers to “investigate allegations of fraud in any state county or local government election.” (It follows a proposal that Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis first advanced last November to establish a new elections police force with 52 employees.)'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/arizona-fake-electors-kifle-invs/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election ...', 'Snippet': 'But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across ...', 'Full_text': 'They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep.

The governor or secretary of state might have refused to certify an election, or issued conflicting claims. A state legislature built in Trump’s image could have tried to toss out the results and appoint their own electors. All of this would have set up tough votes for Republicans in the House and Senate in response, who already faced threats to both their careers and lives on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Arizona results, along with similar candidates winning nominations in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan, raise the prospect of more forceful attempts at these tactics in 2024 should the Republican presidential nominee lose.\n\nBut this is a nightmare scenario that the House and Senate were already thinking about long before Tuesday’s results. In fact, the Senate held a hearing on Wednesday on a bipartisan bill to reform the Electoral Count Act designed with exactly this case in mind.\n\nWhile not foolproof, election experts advocating for the legislation argue it would provide a potentially strong defense against every one of the above possibilities.\n\nHere’s how it would work: The bill would require states to abide by their pre-election laws for appointing electors, making it harder to ignore the election results. If, say, the Arizona governor certified the results, but the secretary of state or other officials sent a rival slate of electors, only the governor’s would count. If the governor were the one refusing to honor the results, it would provide a direct path for federal courts, and eventually the Supreme Court to weigh in, and direct Congress to accept their decision. It would also clarify the definition of a “failed election” that was a prerequisite for some attempts to overturn the results in state legislatures.\n\n“The bill would limit the ability of both the legislature and the governor to mess with genuine election results,” Rick Hasen, an elections expert at UCLA's law school who has supported the legislation, told NBC News. “If the governor tries to not follow state law in certifying the election for Trump or someone like him, there is a procedure to get courts involved.”\n\nSeparate from the state concerns, the bill also would address “potential for mischief” in Congress, as Genevieve Nadeau, a lawyer with the nonpartisan group Protect Democracy, put it to reporters Wednesday. It raises the threshold for objections to results and clarifies that the vice president can’t overrule results, which were the two immediate triggers for the Jan. 6th protests that ended with rioters storming the Capitol.\n\nThe House is also considering election legislation, and some experts supportive of the Senate bill's goals have raised technical concerns about some provisions. But the Senate version has significant Republican support already and could become law in some form this year. If it does, the unfolding story in Arizona goes a long way to explaining why.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/arizona-election-changes-ctzn/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona is ground zero for election changes | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Maine Sen.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party’s most extreme election ideas.\n\nFirst up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn’t like.\n\nIn a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a “12-committee lynching.”\n\nArizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take – describing Bowers’ takedown as “killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.”\n\nThen came Rep. Mark Finchem’s resolution this month on Arizona’s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump’s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nBowers’ response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: “Mr. Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.”\n\nBowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history – at least when it comes to some of his party’s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.\n\nHe has described Trump and the then-President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.\n\nBowers told CNN’s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. “I said, ‘No, I won’t,’” Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, “‘3.5 million people voted here, I’m not gonna unilaterally do that.’”\n\nBowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.\n\nArizona at ground zero\n\nEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThey include bills that would:\n\nA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.\n\nAlex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with “holding the line” to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.\n\nBut, he said, “there are actually a lot of bad things” moving through the legislature “that people are being silent about.”\n\nThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.\n\nVoters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, and decide whether to return one of most vulnerable Senate incumbents, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, to Congress.\n\nThe filing deadline for candidates in Arizona is April 4. The primary election for legislative and statewide offices is slated for August 2.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in that primary is July 5.\n\nThe state’s full calendar, along with information on how to check your voter registration status if you live in Arizona, can be found here at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nLone star on the horizon\n\nControl of both chambers of Congress and a slew of governorships are on the line in upcoming primaries around the country.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/01/11/dr-anthony-fauci-rand-paul-coronavirus-hearing-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': ""'You personally attack me:' Fauci fires back at Sen.

Rand Paul of Kentucky has repeatedly said Fauci lies about the pandemic and in a hearing Tuesday also claimed that he tried to “take down” some scientists who disagreed with him.\n\nPaul and other conservative critics have focused their ire at how the pandemic is being handled on Fauci, the National Institutes of Health infectious disease chief who also is President Joe Biden\'s chief medical adviser. Fauci has needed increased security since 2020 because of threats and harassment against him and his family.\n\nLater in the hearing, Fauci lost his temper when Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, accused him of hiding financial disclosure forms required of public officials.\n\n“You’re so misinformed that it’s extraordinary,” Fauci responded, saying those documents are publicly available upon request. As the exchange ended, Fauci could be heard muttering off-camera, “What a moron.”\n\nTuesday, Fauci expressed frustration that this far into the pandemic the senator still “accuses me of things that are completely untrue” and “kindles the crazies out there.”\n\nHe pointed to the arrest last month of a California man who was stopped for speeding in Iowa and told a sheriff’s deputy he was on the way to the nation’s capital to kill a list of people in power -- including Fauci.

The only issue, as Fauci pointed out, is that his financial disclosure is public. “You are totally incorrect,” said a flabbergasted Fauci.\n\nMarshall went after Fauci hard on Tuesday, but no lawmaker has attacked him as consistently and ardently as Rand Paul. The anti-vax senator from Kentucky has not only bashed the nation’s top infectious disease expert as an egomaniacal tyrant destroying America, but as someone who is responsible for the disease existing in the first place. Fauci during the hearing shed some light on why Paul might be spreading lies about him.\n\n“Why would a senator want to do this?” Fauci said. “Go to Rand Paul’s website, and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here. You can do $5, $10, $20, $100. So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nHere’s the full exchange:\n\nFauci exposing one of Paul’s motivations — if not his only motivation — in attacking him came during a heated exchange between the senator and the scientist. Such exchanges are now customary whenever Fauci appears before the Senate. He was particularly exasperated as ever on Tuesday given how Omicron is causing case rates to skyrocket. “We are here at a committee to look a virus now that has killed nearly 900,000 people,” Fauci said. “And the purpose of the committee was to try to get things out, how we can help the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me.”\n\nFauci eventually dropped the hammer, explaining that the harassment of his family and death threats against himself before recounting how a man who was arrested last month in Iowa was on his way from California to Washington, D.C., to kill Fauci and others. He wondered why a senator would tell lies to inspire such animosity against someone who is basically just sharing the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. The reason is because Paul thinks it’s good for him politically, and there’s no clearer proof than the billing his #FireFauci campaign gets on his website next to all those donation buttons.\n\nPaul has been one of the Republican Party’s most prolific superspreaders of Covid misinformation in addition to attacking Fauci. YouTube has removed several of Paul’s Covid videos for violating their policy on Covid misinformation, prompting Paul to announce earlier this year that he’s leaving the platform. A few days later, he essentially endorsed the Omicron, describing the variant as “nature’s vaccine” during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nAs Paul was badgering Fauci on Tuesday, the United States broke the record for people hospitalized with Covid.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/fauci-knew-nih-funded-wuhans-gain-of-function-research-as-pandemic-began-email-reveals/', 'Headline': ""Anthony Fauci Knew NIH Funded Wuhan's Gain-of-Function Research as ..."", 'Snippet': 'Despite his claims to the contrary, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, knew by January 2020 that his agency was funding gain-of-function research of novel coronaviruses in Wuhan, China.', 'Full_text': ''}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57268111', 'Headline': 'Covid origin: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory is so disputed - BBC', 'Snippet': 'More than three years after Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how the virus first emerged remains a mystery.', 'Full_text': 'More than three years after Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how the virus first emerged remains a mystery.\n\nBut on 28 February 2023 the controversial claim that the pandemic might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory - once dismissed by many as a fringe conspiracy theory - resurfaced with FBI Director Christopher Wray\'s comments that the bureau believes Covid-19 ""most likely"" originated in a ""Chinese government-controlled lab"".\n\nIt is the first public confirmation of the FBI\'s classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.\n\nIn response, Beijing accused Washington of ""political manipulation"".\n\nSo what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter?\n\nWhat is the lab-leak theory?\n\nIt\'s a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\n\nIts supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.\n\nThe institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.\n\nThose who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.\n\nThe controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.\n\nWhile many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.\n\nA classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.\n\nBut it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.\n\n""That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,"" Anthony Fauci, President Biden\'s chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.\n\nPresident Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, ""including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident"".\n\nIn May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to ""redouble"" their efforts on this.\n\nWhat do scientists think?\n\nThe issue is still hotly contested.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.\n\nA team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was ""extremely unlikely"".\n\nBut many have since questioned their findings.\n\nA prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.\n\n""We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,"" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.\n\nThey\'re not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.\n\nEven the WHO\'s own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: ""All hypotheses remain open and require further study.""\n\nAnd Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was ""not convinced"" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.\n\nWhat does China say?\n\nChina has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.\n\nResponding to Mr Wray\'s remarks, China\'s foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.\n\nThe US intelligence community had a history of ""misdeeds"" involving ""fraud and deception"", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.\n\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia.\n\nThe Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\n\nProf Shi Zhengli - often referred to as ""China\'s Batwoman"" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.\n\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\n\nOnce the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.\n\nIs there another theory?\n\nYes, and it\'s called the ""natural origin"" theory.\n\nThis argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.\n\nSupporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or ""intermediary host"".\n\nThat idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was ""likely to very likely"" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.\n\nThis hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.\n\nNevertheless, following FBI Director Wray\'s remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.\n\nA natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.\n\n""There\'s been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,"" he said.\n\nProf Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy\'s conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan ""appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus"".\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nGiven the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.\n\nAny confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.\n\n""From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,"" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021\n\n""We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that\'s required.""\n\nBut others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.\n\n""We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can\'t do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,"" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore\'s National University Hospital, told the BBC.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners.

Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, have collected more than 8,000 documents, including emails and other communications, plus nearly 25 hours of witness testimony.\n\nTheir report details the January through March 2020 activities of Dr. Anthony Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins in encouraging an international team of prominent scientists to attempt to debunk the notion that the pandemic could have originated in a lab.\n\nFollowing a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call, Fauci and Collins “prompted” the scientists to act. According to the report:\n\n“Proximal Origin” refers to “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” the paper that ultimately was published in a scientific journal.\n\nThe end of this exercise was not a disinterested scientific effort, but rather an elaborate scheme to create a preferred political narrative that would dominate public discussion of the novel coronavirus. The means was publication in a high-powered, peer-reviewed professional journal that would discredit the “lab leak” theory.\n\nEncouraged by Collins and Fauci, the authors submitted their initial draft to Nature, but the journal turned it down because the editors wanted a stronger dismissal of the lab leak theory. As Andersen testified to the subcommittee, “They thought that we came down too strongly on the side that the virus had been of possible lab origin.”\n\nSo, the authors revised their paper, adding language that the lab origin was implausible, and successfully submitted it to Nature Medicine, part of the Nature portfolio of journals. The finished product—titled “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2”—was\n\npublished in\n\nNature Medicine\n\non March 17, 2020.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article, according to the subcommittee report, “is one of the single most impactful and influential scientific papers in history, and it expressed conclusions that were not based on sound science nor in fact, but instead on assumptions.”\n\nIn arguing for a natural or zoonotic (transferred from animals to humans) origin of the pandemic, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 had certain genetic features not found in previous coronaviruses was a problem, but an even greater difficulty was the absence of hard data. On\n\nJan. 3, 2020,\n\nCommunist Chinese authorities shut down the sharing of any COVID-19 data or information without government approval.\n\nAs noted in a\n\nSenate staff report\n\nsponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.:\n\nTherefore, none of the scientists engaged by Fauci or Collins in February 2020 had, or could have had, access to any hard Chinese data on the novel coronavirus—especially information of an intermediate animal host—that could have proven, or at least strongly supported, the Chinese-endorsed narrative of the zoonotic or natural origin of the pandemic.\n\nSeveral potential candidates for the intermediate animal host, including pangolins and\n\nraccoon dogs\n\n, have been floated; but to this day, no such host has been identified.\n\nNumerous emails among the multiple authors during the Nature Medicine article’s drafting in February 2020 are especially revealing. Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University, for example, initially expressed the view that the virus could have been genetically manipulated in a lab. Based on a previous\n\nselect subcommittee report\n\n, he was not alone among this group of virologists in his initial impressions.\n\nAccording to this week’s subcommittee report, Andersen, of Scripps Research Institute, who completed the initial draft, admitted in an email on Feb. 8, 2020:\n\nIn a Feb. 11 email, Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University said the paper provided a “plausible argument against genetic engineering,” but it did not close the door on an “inadvertent release” of the virus from the Wuhan lab. It stated:\n\nThen again, on Feb. 20, Andersen—seemingly struggling with the task of refuting a lab origin conclusively—admitted in an email, “We all really, really wish we could do that (that’s how this got started), but unfortunately, it’s just not possible given the data.”\n\nSo, in the absence of scientific data, Andersen and his team proposed a theoretical construct of how SARS-CoV-2 emerged in nature.\n\nFuture congressional inquiries into this controversy should, of course, focus on the motivation behind this extraordinary effort to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nBased on the email exchanges among the key participants, this little platoon seemed inordinately obsessed with maintaining good relations with\n\nCommunist China\n\n. In a Feb. 2 email, Dr. Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh wrote:\n\nScientists must keep their priorities in order, emphasized Dr. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist: “Further debate about such accusations [of a lab leak] would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular.”\n\nCollins, the NIH director, echoed these sentiments, saying that without a case for COVID-19’s natural origins, ”the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.”\n\nIn short, the email traffic follows the politics.\n\nConcerning Fauci, the subcommittee report simply recounts that he knew at the time, or should have known, that his agency had\n\nfunded EcoHealth Alliance\n\n, a firm engaged in “dangerous experiments” with the Wuhan Institute of Virology; that these coronavirus research activities were conducted with “very little oversight”; that EcoHealth Alliance was not in compliance with the federal government’s grant requirements and failed to report on its work in a timely fashion; and that the Wuhan Institute’s biosafety levels were “substandard”—\n\na fact recently confirmed\n\nby the director of national intelligence. Congressional investigators will surely need to probe Fauci’s memory of these matters.\n\nThough the hypothesis of a lab leak as the origin of a pandemic that has killed more than 1.1 million Americans is no longer dismissed today as a “conspiracy theory,” the damage to democratic discourse has been done.\n\nThe Nature Medicine article became the seminal scientific paper that drove the dominant narrative of COVID-19’s natural origins for the past three and half years. It also provided the strongest justification to marginalize alternative scientific opinion.\n\nThat corrosive impact on public discourse was itself a scandal. As New York Times columnist\n\nBret Stephens observed\n\n: “The reasons for this—rank partisanship and credulous reporting—and the methods by which it was enforced—censorship and vilification—are reminders that sometimes the most destructive enemies of science can be those who claim to speak in its name.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/18/bu-lab-wasnt-required-to-clear-potentially-controversial-study-with-nih-director-says/', 'Headline': 'BU lab wasn’t required to clear Covid study with NIH, director says', 'Snippet': 'T he director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the National Institutes of Health because it wasn’t funded by the federal agency.', 'Full_text': ""The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the National Institutes of Health because it wasn’t funded by the federal agency.\n\nRonald Corley said the research, which was designed to explore what makes some SARS-CoV-2 viruses more pathogenic than others, was paid for with money from the university itself. The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research. In letters posted by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee this month, an NIH official said EcoHealth Alliance had not been able to hand over lab notebooks and other records from its Wuhan partner that relate to controversial experiments involving modified bat viruses, despite multiple requests.\n\nIn an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions requiring provision of records to NIH upon request.”\n\nThe termination notice comes after the NIH chided EcoHealth last fall for not immediately notifying the agency after its experiments showed modified coronaviruses replicated at a faster rate in experimental mice than an unmodified virus. The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs.

The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/09/1044985/shi-zhengli-covid-lab-leak-wuhan/', 'Headline': 'She’s at the center of the covid lab leak controversy.

A leading center for coronavirus research, it was the first facility to isolate the new virus, and the first to sequence its genome.

Some have suggested that her bat samples could be the source of the covid-19 virus, which scientists call SARS-CoV-2. They have claimed that the virus could have hitched a ride to Wuhan by infecting one of her team members in their fieldwork collecting samples from bats. Or, some speculate, the live viruses her team cultured in the lab, including—more worryingly—the ones they created by genetic tinkering, could be the source of the pandemic.\n\nAll eyes were on the WHO, the leading international public health agency, to probe covid-19’s origins. The team’s mission was to examine when and where the outbreak had started and how the new virus crossed over to humans. The report, which was released last March, concluded it was “extremely unlikely” that covid-19 could have been caused by a lab accident. The situation the team ranked most likely was that it had jumped from bats to humans via some intermediary animal. Their results, supported by research published in peer-reviewed journals and by ongoing studies, suggest that the pandemic probably started at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in central Wuhan, where live mammals were sold and where most of the early covid-19 cases emerged.\n\nNot everybody agrees, but the majority of virologists and infectious-disease experts, especially those working directly on the origins question, lean toward that theory, barring the emergence of new evidence that persuades them otherwise.\n\nSpillover from animals to humans “was how almost every major epidemic got started in the past decades,” says Shi’s longtime collaborator Linfa Wang, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at the Duke–National University of Singapore Medical School and a member of the WHO team that in 2003 investigated the origins of SARS, a deadly infectious disease caused by a coronavirus now known as SARS-CoV-1. That illness sickened 8,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 800 between 2002 and 2004. “It’s a common and well-documented pathway,” he says.\n\nBut one year after the WHO’s visit to Wuhan, the disease detectives have yet to find the guilty animal or other indisputable evidence of natural origins. Critics also question the conclusion of the agency’s mission team partly because one of its members, Daszak, who is a prominent advocate of the natural origins theory, has potential conflicts of interest. Speculation over the possibility of a lab accident has surged. Inflaming the suspicions are concerns over biosafety procedures at the Wuhan lab, political tensions between China and the US, and a general sense that the Chinese government is not to be trusted.\n\nBy trying to understand the process and context of Shi’s work—and to find out who she was—I wanted to learn what role, if any, China’s bat woman had in the origins of covid-19.\n\nScientists like David Relman, an expert on microbiology and biosecurity at Stanford University, are dismayed at the way the lab leak theory has been dismissed. He helped organize a group of 18 scientists to sign a letter published in Science last May calling for further investigation of a possible accident. (At least two of those involved later sought to distance themselves from the letter after seeing how it had been used to promote the lab leak theory.) Soon afterwards, President Joe Biden directed the US intelligence community to intensify its probe into the pandemic’s origins. The declassified report released in October shows that it reached no firm conclusion.\n\nIn December 2020, a month before the WHO visit, I too embarked on a search for answers. I talked to dozens of top scientists and biosafety experts worldwide. I spent six weeks in Wuhan, where I interviewed Shi and her team for a total of more than 40 hours. I had a private meeting with three members of the WHO mission. I visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology half a dozen times, often on the spur of the moment, and went with the scientists on a virus-sampling trip to a bat cave. By trying to understand the process and context of Shi’s work—and to find out who she was—I wanted to learn what role, if any, China’s bat woman had in the origins of covid-19.\n\nProbing covid-19’s origins will not only help us understand how coronaviruses work but shine a bright light on the human behaviors—including the types of scientific research—that risk causing a pandemic in the future.\n\nLike the WHO team, I have not gone through Shi’s freezers or lab books, and therefore I cannot prove or disprove whether activities associated with her research caused the pandemic. It’s more about providing additional perspectives—having Shi and her team tell their side of the story on the record, and in the most detail to date, so that the world can better understand how this deeply entrenched controversy has come about and how we can move forward.\n\nMeeting China’s bat woman\n\nI met Shi Zhengli in person for the first time on a cold afternoon in December 2020. We had spoken earlier that year for an article published in Scientific American. The level of access she has given me is unparalleled. She rarely speaks with the press, and her interaction with journalists writing for the Western media has been largely confined to emails and texts. She told me she spoke to me because my strong science background allows me to grasp the nuances and complexity of her work, because I understand China, and because we can communicate in Chinese, our native tongue, in which I conducted the interviews.\n\nWe met for lunch and then went for a walk in a nearby park. A few days later, I visited the institute’s city campus in central Wuhan—approximately 12 miles from the suburban site that the WHO team later toured. Her lab was on the second floor of a solemn-looking cream-colored building. The main room had rows of benches with weighing machines, polystyrene ice boxes, and desktop centrifuges. Bottles of chemicals and solutions were tightly packed on the shelves. One student was typing away on a computer, while another was pipetting a tiny amount of colorless liquid from one test tube to another. The scene gave me a sense of déjà vu—I’d spent a decade working as a molecular biologist, including six years as a postdoc. It reminded me of my days in the lab.\n\n“It’s probably not that different from where you worked,” said Shi, as if she could read my mind.\n\nShi is petite, with short wavy hair that is neatly combed. Her voice is high and light, with the sparkle of a soprano (she is an amateur folksinger). That day she wore a beige sweater and blue jeans. As we went on to other parts of her lab—the deep freezers that held bat samples, and the rooms for culturing cells in petri dishes—she explained that her team had about three dozen researchers. That’s a lot for a Chinese lab, but it’s not the gigantic operation that many outsiders imagine. “I do not have an army of researchers and unlimited resources,” she said. Until the pandemic hit, coronavirus research was not a trendy subject and could not easily attract funding.\n\nShi is one of the rare breed of virologists who are just as comfortable in the field as in the lab. She grew up in a small village in central China’s Henan province and spent most of her childhood roaming the hills. She doesn’t regard herself as ambitious. When she graduated from the prestigious Wuhan University in late 1987, she told me, “I thought I had achieved my career goal and the next stage was to get married and have kids.” The main reason she went on to study at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was to stay in the same city as her then boyfriend. But as China invested in sending promising young scientists abroad to pursue doctoral degrees, Shi grabbed the opportunity.\n\nIn 2000, she got her PhD at Université Montpellier 2 in France. Studying there was an unusual decision since she didn’t speak French, and a difficult one because it meant leaving her young son behind in China; the stipend was not enough to support a young family. But the experience left a positive imprint; she particularly appreciated the Western culture that prized “critical thinking, independent-mindedness, and not following the crowd,” she told me. “You can’t do great science without any of these. This is what China really needs to get better at.”\n\nAfterwards, she returned to the Wuhan institute, where she focused mainly on aquaculture pests until 2004. At that time, the world was still reeling from SARS, and Wang, the Duke-NUS infectious-disease specialist, was working in Australia and looking for a virologist in China to help hunt for the origins of the new disease. Shi jumped at the opportunity, joining an international team to collect blood, urine, saliva, and feces from bat colonies in mountainous areas across China. They found SARS-like coronaviruses in bats within a year, but it took nearly a decade to prove that bats were the source of the contagion. Through their collaboration, Shi and Wang became friends; colleagues knew them for their karaoke duets, and they earned the nicknames “bat woman” and “bat man,” respectively.\n\nAs Shi showed me around her lab, she pointed to the deep freezers where the team kept tens of thousands of bat samples in chemical soups. She told me how virus-containing samples are kept frozen in the field, either on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen, before being transferred to dedicated, double-locked deep freezers in the Wuhan lab. Only designated personnel can access those samples; they need approval from two senior staff members, each of whom is in charge of a separate key to the two locks. All access to the samples is logged.\n\nThe core of her research over the past 18 years, she explained, has been to look for bat viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-1, and to understand how they could evolve new features that allow them to infect humans. She talked me through that process, which begins with testing each bat sample to see if it contains a coronavirus—using the same PCR-based technique as many covid-19 tests. All coronaviruses contain a gene that encodes an enzyme called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RdRp, which helps viruses replicate by making more copies of their genomes. If the characteristic RdRp shows up in a bat sample, it’s a telltale sign that a coronavirus is present.\n\nAt first glance I was concerned by the sheer size of Shi’s collection of more than 20,000 bat samples. But she explained that on average only 10% contain coronaviruses, and only 10% of those are closely related to SARS-CoV-1: in all its years, the team has identified approximately 220 such viruses. The findings, say virologists such as Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney, have provided valuable insight into the evolutionary history of coronaviruses and the way they generate genetic variants.\n\nWhenever the team found a bat relative of SARS-CoV-1, Shi says, she asked the same questions: How threatening is it to other animal species, including humans? What would it take for the virus to become one that, like SARS-CoV-1, can cause major epidemics?\n\nThe real thing\n\nAn important way to test if a coronavirus can evolve into something more threatening is to see whether its spike proteins—the weapons of invasion that give the virus a crown-like appearance—can latch onto a molecule called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, which is present on the surface of cells in most vertebrates. To find out about a virus’s potential to infect people, Shi’s team would sequence its spike gene, compare it with that of SARS-CoV-1, and study on a computer its structure and ability to bind to ACE2.\n\nThe researchers also used pseudoviruses—viruses whose ability to copy their genomes is disabled—to test whether the spikes could help them enter cells from various animals. Scientists all over the world use this approach to study new pathogens without resorting to live viruses. It can be conducted with relatively inexpensive biocontainment precautions at what’s known as biosafety level 2, or BSL-2: researchers wear gloves and lab coats, and they work in cabinets that have air filtration and are under negative pressure to keep pathogens inside.\n\nThe first step for this type of work is to extract genetic material for genomic sequencing, which would inactivate all the microbes in the sample. This and subsequent cell-entry studies using pseudoviruses are well-established, safe methods.\n\nBut while pseudoviruses are a great tool, spikes—it’s become increasingly clear—are not the only factor that determines a virus’s ability to infect cells. The approach also can’t show, for instance, how exactly a virus makes cells sick, how it spreads from one cell to another, or how a pathogen might evade the body’s immune response. Those questions, which are critical for the development of drugs and vaccines, can be addressed only by using the real thing—a fully functional virus. And it’s this more dangerous work that has become the center of the controversy around Shi.\n\nIsolating live coronaviruses from bat samples is notoriously tricky—mostly because only a small fraction of samples contain even a whiff of the viruses (whereas specimens from people with SARS or covid-19 are often teeming with coronaviruses). The process of culturing viruses involves providing them with cells they can infect. Several labs around the world have tried to get live bat coronaviruses and failed. Until January 2021, the Wuhan lab was the only one that had managed the feat, according to Stephen Goldstein, a coronavirus expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. And the person with the green thumb was Yang Xinglou, a senior research scientist on Shi’s team.\n\nI met Yang at the institute’s maximum-biocontainment campus on the outskirts of Wuhan on a muggy afternoon last May. He came to pick me up at the main gate wearing a turquoise-colored T-shirt and jeans. In his mid-30s, Yang was slim and of medium height. His hair was neatly trimmed, but in a sudden breeze, his bangs danced over a forehead dominated by thick brows. I filled out a registration form and showed the security guards my national identity card, and we walked to his office across the neatly manicured campus.\n\nInstead of walking along the winding, camera-lined driveway meant for cars, we stepped onto a narrow path that ran by a small lake. On the far side I could see an austere-looking square building, about four floors high, sturdy, with silver siding and few windows. Inside it was China’s flagship BSL-4 lab—the crown jewel of the country’s microbiology work.\n\nI did not go inside the BSL-4 facility: there are strict protocols that make it difficult for any visitors to get in, let alone the press. I did, however, visit the nearby BSL-3 lab, which handles less deadly pathogens. After undergoing further security checks, we entered its control room, where large screens revealed what was inside: a preparatory room, three rooms for culturing cells, a room for working with small animals such as mice and rats, a dedicated space for disinfection, and the entrances to both the lab and the control room itself. While I watched, one researcher put materials into a decontamination chamber, and two scientists in white full-body protective suits sat in front of a biosafety cabinet, working with rows of small vials behind a glass screen. A black tube on the back of their suits delivered filtered air to their face masks.\n\nIt was here, on January 5, 2020, that Yang first successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient sample—the first isolate of the new coronavirus. “Which room did you use?” I asked. “Cell culture room 3,” he told me, pointing at one of the screens. “It was in that cabinet.”\n\nIt was just an ordinary cabinet in an ordinary room, with two bottles of disinfectant and two biohazard garbage bins behind the glass screen—but it’s now a landmark in the battle against the biggest pandemic in a century.\n\nIt was here, on January 5, 2020, that Yang first successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient sample—the first isolate of the new coronavirus.\n\nYang has worked at the institute with pathogens in bats and rodents since 2008, developing and refining virus-catching techniques. There were lots of failures along the way, but in 2012, he hit the jackpot: a sample his team retrieved from a bat cave near Kunming successfully infected a type of monkey kidney cells called Vero E6, which has high levels of ACE2 on its surface. Once a live virus was at their disposal, the scientists could test directly whether it posed a potential threat.\n\nIt was a major breakthrough: for the first time researchers were able to demonstrate that bat coronaviruses in a petri dish could also infect cells from other species, including pigs and humans, by binding to their ACE2 receptors. The virus was 95% identical to SARS-CoV-1. The team named it WIV1 to indicate that it was isolated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Their study, published in Nature in 2013, provided strong evidence that SARS-CoV-1 originated in bats.\n\nIn all his years of work, Yang has managed to isolate only three bat coronaviruses—all of them close relatives of SARS-CoV-1. More recently, the team managed to synthesize three bat coronaviruses from their genomic sequences. All six are close relatives of SARS-CoV-1. None of them, said virologists MIT Technology Review spoke to, could have been the source of SARS-CoV-2: they’re just too different.\n\nThere was, however, one other virus in a bat sample that is a lot closer to SARS-CoV-2—96% identical. It has its own curious origin story, and in some parts of the scientific community and beyond, it’s become a prime suspect in the hunt for the pandemic’s origins. It’s called RaTG13.\n\nIn 2020, with the pandemic raging, some scientists—including Stanford’s Relman—wondered if Shi had been wrong. Perhaps, they say, a SARS-like coronavirus was to blame. Perhaps there was even a link between the disease that affected the Mojiang miners and covid-19.\n\nThat suspicion was bolstered in May 2020, when the anonymous owner of the Twitter handle @TheSeeker268—who claimed to me in Twitter texts that he is a 30-year-old man trained in architecture and filmmaking and lives in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar—dug up a 2016 PhD thesis by Huang Canping from the Chinese internet. Huang was a student of George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, and his thesis cited the Wuhan Institute of Virology as claiming that four of the Mojiang miners had antibodies against SARS-CoV-1. Scientists like Monali Rahalkar, a microbial ecologist at the MACS Agharkar Research Institute in Pune, India, and a strong proponent of the lab leak theory, said that this suggests the miners were infected by a SARS-like coronavirus. Social media and the press teemed with suspicion that Shi tried to hide the fact.\n\nThe scientists directly involved in the work deny that speculation. Shi said her team did not find such antibodies, although she said some early tests did produce false positives that were corrected when the assays were fully validated. MIT Technology Review has been unable to locate Huang, but Gao said his lab never analyzed the miners’ antibody status, and that Huang’s statement—possibly based on the false-positive results, which Shi discussed at an internal meeting in 2012—was erroneous. After covid-19 struck, Shi’s team went back to the Mojiang samples to look for traces of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found none.\n\n“Many pathogens can cause pneumonia-like symptoms similar to SARS and covid-19,"" Zhong told me. Some local clinicians, he adds, still suspect it was a fungus that had sickened the miners. “It remains a mystery to this day.”\n\nIt’s not unusual for respiratory illnesses to have an unknown cause, but even though Shi couldn’t figure out what had sickened the Mojiang miners, her instinct told her that something interesting might be going on. “What viruses were lurking in the cave?” she remembers wondering. Between 2012 and 2015, her team undertook more than half a dozen trips to the mine shaft, about 1,100 miles from Wuhan, and collected 1,322 bat samples.\n\nThey looked for the coronavirus-specific RdRp gene, and when they found it, they investigated further. In the end, the bat samples turned out to contain nearly 300 coronaviruses. Nine belonged to the same group of viruses as SARS-CoV-1—known as beta-coronaviruses—even though their RdRp genes were quite different: they were “distant cousins,” Shi told me.\n\n“Why are you so different?” Shi wondered, but eventually she put the sample back in the freezer.\n\nEight of the nine were closely related to each other, but one—from a single fecal sample labeled “4991”—had a very distinct genomic signature. “Why are you so different?” Shi wondered, but eventually she put the sample back in the freezer. Her work was to look for bat viruses that could potentially cause SARS-like epidemics, and none of the Mojiang sequences appeared to be “directly relevant to our inquiry,” she told me. “So they were not the focus of our research.”\n\nIn 2018, though, 4991 was brought back out again. The Wuhan Institute of Virology had bought a new desktop sequencing machine, which made it much faster and cheaper to get a complete view of a virus’s genomic secrets, and 4991 was among the first batch of samples to be sequenced with the new device. The analysis confirmed that the virus residing in the sample was very different from SARS-CoV-1; they are 80% identical to each other across the genome. (The genomes of the other eight Mojiang viruses, which were sequenced after the pandemic, show they are only about three quarters identical to both SARS and covid-19 viruses across the genome.) It was always interesting to find new viruses, but there didn’t seem to be anything special for the researchers to write up, Shi said: “It didn’t seem to be a remarkable virus.”\n\nIt was so unremarkable, in fact, that it was expendable: In their attempts to piece together its genomic makeup, the scientists used up all the sample. By 2018 the virus existed only as a sequence in the Wuhan institute’s database.\n\nIn most cases, that would be the end of the story: the obscure, irrelevant virus would fade into oblivion. Except that it didn’t.\n\n“I didn’t want to screw up”\n\nAt 5:30 in the morning on January 2, 2020, Si Haorui, a student on Shi’s team, headed toward the institute to start his day’s work. It was cold, and the white cloud of his breath danced around as he walked on the dark, empty street.\n\nSi is not a morning person. He rarely emerges before 10:30. But on that frigid January morning, he had a battle to fight. Two and half days earlier, clinicians at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, the city’s infectious-disease center, had sent samples to the virology institute for urgent analysis.\n\nThey were from seven patients in serious condition who had been recently hospitalized for a mysterious pneumonia.\n\nThe following day, December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued its first public statement about the outbreak, saying it was probing the cause of 27 pneumonia cases. Shi’s lab was among the first to officially investigate the illness, and Si was part of the team racing to pinpoint the cause. Working around the clock, team members had found coronavirus RdRp genes in five out of the seven patients’ samples; their next step was to sequence the viral genome. “That’s my specialty,” said Si, a slim man in his mid-20s whose eyes curve into two arcs when he smiles, the day we met at the institute’s sequencing facility. “I knew the stakes were high. I didn’t want to screw up.”\n\n(Shi’s lab was one of the four teams designated by China’s National Health Commission to work in parallel to pin down the cause of the new disease. This was a high-profile assignment, and only the commission had the authority to declare outbreaks of an emerging infectious disease and to release the relevant information.)\n\nStepping into the sequencing room felt like being a soldier stepping onto the battlefield, Si recalled. He had laid out his weapons the night before—the software he had tweaked for piecing together the genomic sequence of unknown pathogens. The machine was still running, busy reading short fragments of the genetic material from the bugs in those patients’ samples. The low humming sound of the machine filled the room. Si’s eyes were fixated on the sequencer. It reached the final stage of sequencing. It began processing the files. It took forever. Time seemed to stand still. Eventually it was done, and with a slightly shaky hand, he inserted a flash disk and copied the files over. He bolted upstairs to his office, where he could link to the institute’s supercomputer for the analysis.\n\nBy 8:30 a.m., the genomic makeup had emerged. One sequence, now known as WIV04, was almost complete and of high quality: it was a coronavirus.\n\nShi entered the sequence into the institutional and international databases to see if it was new. The closest match was the sequence from sample 4991, which the team had taken from Mojiang in 2013. The virus, no longer obscure or irrelevant, now deserved an official name. The team called it RaTG13—Ra for the bat species it was found in, Rhinolophus affinis; TG for Tongguan, the town where it was found; and 13 for the year of its discovery. It was, as they reported in Nature a month later, 96% identical to the coronavirus found in the new patients.\n\nThe fact that RaTG13 is so similar to SARS-CoV-2 has aroused suspicion. Critics like Alina Chan—a molecular biologist specializing in gene therapy at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts—wonder why Shi’s Nature paper published in February 2020 didn’t mention that RaTG13 came from the Mojiang mine where people had come down with the mysterious pneumonia. Chan, who leans strongly towards the lab leak theory, has helped it spread far and wide, and signed the Science letter calling for further investigation of the possibility. She said in Viral, a book she co-authored with the British science writer Matt Ridley, that the Wuhan institute had been “economical with the truth” about this.\n\nThe overall similarity between the two viruses, however, is not evidence that RaTG13 is the source of covid-19, according to an article published in Cell last September, authored by two dozen or so leading virologists and infectious-disease experts. The two viruses may be related, but they sit on different evolutionary branches that diverged half a century ago, says David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow in the UK. “RaTG13 couldn’t have naturally morphed into SARS-CoV-2,” he says. Neither could anybody have used RaTG13 as the backbone to engineer SARS-CoV-2, as some proponents of the lab leak theory have argued: the two viruses are different in 1,100 or so nucleotides spread across their whole genomes—a gap too large for any realistic effort. Making SARS-CoV-2 from RaTG13, says virologist Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, “would have required a feat of unprecedented genetic engineering.”\n\nMeanwhile, evidence for the natural origins theory continues to mount. In the past year, several teams independent of the Wuhan institute have uncovered more than a dozen close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 in China, Japan, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia. In a preprint paper posted in September 2021, a team of Laotian and French scientists reported the discovery of viruses in Laos that, according to Robertson, shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 as recently as a decade ago. These new discoveries are evidence that SARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved in the wild, says Robertson, who was not involved in the study. “We are closing in on the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor,” he says.\n\nBut even if none of the bat coronavirus samples from Shi’s team are to blame for the pandemic, they aren’t the only viruses the scientists work with. Part of their research involves studying how the machinery of viruses works; and that has involved genetic mixing and matching of different pathogens to probe the function of viral genes. Could one of those chimeric viruses have been the source of the pandemic? To find out, I needed to talk to Shi.\n\nGenetic tinkering\n\nBat woman takes her nickname seriously. A bat key ring lay on the desk in her office when I visited. A picture of her releasing a bat during a virus-hunting expedition hung near the window. Above the door was a green and yellow ceramic plate depicting a flying bat, which Shi bought on a field trip in Sichuan province.\n\n“Bats are a symbol of blessing in traditional Chinese culture,” she told me. They are called bian fu, meaning “flat” and “blessing,” respectively. “We often see bat motifs in jewelry, ceramics, and buildings in remote villages,” she said.\n\nAs the researchers’ collection of bat coronavirus sequences grew—especially after 2012, when they first managed to culture live viruses—they wanted to pinpoint the genetic ingredients that allow those viruses to infect humans, so scientists could develop drugs and vaccines to counter them.\n\nShi was particularly interested in whether the spike protein was the sole factor that affected a coronavirus’s ability to infect cells, or whether other parts of the pathogen’s genome also had a role. One of her bat coronavirus sequences, SHC014, seemed ideal for such an inquiry. It was 95% identical to SARS-CoV-1 across the genome, but its spike was very different, and pseudovirus studies showed it was unable to facilitate entry into cells from several species, including humans. Did this mean that it was unable to infect humans?\n\nScientists could not test this question directly because they hadn’t managed to isolate a live virus from the bat sample. But two genetic approaches could help shed light. One was to synthesize the virus from its genomic sequence; the other was to see whether SARS-CoV-1 could still cause disease if its spike was replaced with that of SHC014.\n\nShi didn’t have the necessary tools to do this type of genetic work, so in July 2013 she emailed Ralph Baric—a towering figure in viral genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill—about joining forces along those lines of inquiry.\n\nThe collaboration with Baric was not a close one, Shi told me: there was no exchange of laboratory staff, and Shi’s main contribution was to provide SHC014’s genomic sequence, which was yet to be published at the time. The findings, published in Nature Medicine in 2015, were surprising. It turned out that both the synthesized SHC014 and the SARS-CoV-1-SHC014 chimera were able to infect human cells and make mice sick. Both were less lethal than SARS-CoV-1, but—worryingly—existing drugs and vaccines that worked against SARS were unable to counter their effects.\n\nMeanwhile, Shi’s team was attempting similar tinkering in her own lab in a project funded by the US National Institutes of Health, which aimed to probe the genetic ingredients that could allow bat viruses to cause SARS-like diseases in humans. But while Baric focused on the human pathogen SARS-CoV-1 in the Nature Medicine paper, Shi used only its bat relatives—mostly WIV1, the first bat coronavirus the team had isolated. Their real-world risk to humans was unknown. By the time the pandemic broke out, her team had created a total of a dozen or so chimeric viruses by swapping WIV1’s spike with its counterpart from newly identified sequences of bat coronaviruses, only a handful of which could infect human cells in a petri dish.\n\nThere were more surprises in store. In an unpublished experiment, released by the NIH in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by The Intercept, the researchers tested the ability of three such chimeras to infect mice expressing human ACE2. Compared with their parental strain, WIV1, the three chimeric viruses grew a lot more quickly in the mouse lungs in the early stage of the infection, but WIV1 caught up by the end of the experiment.\n\nThe differences surprised Shi, but what puzzled her the most was that the chimera causing the most weight loss in infected mice—an indicator of its pathogenicity—was WIV1-SHC014, whose spike was most dissimilar to that of SARS-CoV-1. The one whose spike was most similar had no effect on the animals’ weight.\n\nThe results from genetic studies in both Baric’s and Shi’s labs—both collaborating with the New York–based EcoHealth Alliance—have provided compelling evidence that the spike protein is not the only factor in whether a virus can make an animal sick, researchers say. “We can’t assess the emergence potential of viruses using only pseudovirus assays or predictions based on genomic sequences and molecular modeling,” Shi told me.\n\nNone of the chimeras created in Shi’s labs was closely related to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, none could have been the cause of the pandemic. But it does seem that the team created at least one chimeric virus, WIV1-SHC014, with a functional gain—that is, increased pathogenicity—relative to the parental strain, WIV. Critics like Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, regard this as the type of gain-of-function research that ought to be subject to strict regulatory oversight. But Shi says that in none of those studies—including her collaborations with Baric and with EcoHealth—did the teams intend to create more dangerous viruses. None of the chimeras had been reasonably anticipated at the time of proposal to have increased transmissibility or pathogenicity in mammals.\n\nAccording to an NIH spokesperson, the grant Shi jointly applied for with the EcoHealth Alliance—the only one with a sub-award to the Wuhan institute—“was reviewed and determined by experts to fall outside the scope” of its regulatory framework for gain-of-function research.\n\nVirologists such as the University of Utah’s Goldstein argue that such genetic studies could help protect us from future pandemics. In the past year, research teams including Baric’s have demonstrated the possibility of developing so-called pan-coronavirus vaccines that could simultaneously block a group of coronaviruses—including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, their bat relatives that Shi has discovered, and potentially other relatives that are yet to be identified. Last September, NIH announced an award of $36.3 million to further such work. Discovering novel viruses in the wild and using genetic techniques to probe their function in the lab, researchers say, could point toward ways of mitigating and treating future disease outbreaks similar to SARS and covid-19.\n\nBiosafety challenges\n\nEven though none of those chimeric viruses was the source of covid-19, there are still concerns that the biosafety standards in the Wuhan lab might not have been rigorous enough to prevent research activities from causing the pandemic.\n\n“China doesn’t have a blanket biosafety regulation on all coronavirus research,” she said. “Everything is assessed on a case-by-case basis.” Studies of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, for instance, have to be done in BSL-3 labs, whereas the human coronaviruses that cause the common cold are handled under BSL-2 conditions. What about bat viruses?\n\nThe Wuhan institute’s biosafety committees ruled a decade ago that while work with animals must be carried out in BSL-3, molecular and cell-culture work involving bat coronaviruses can be done in BSL-2, albeit in biosafety cabinets with air filtration and under negative pressure to keep viruses inside.\n\nSome scientists, like Ebright, regard this as unsafe. Bat coronaviruses are, as he puts it, “uncharacterized agents” with unknown virulence and transmissibility. “The only acceptable approach is to start with a high biosafety-level assignment … and to lower the biosafety-level assignment only if and when it is determined it is prudent to do so,” he told me in an email.\n\nOthers, however, don’t think Shi’s work indicates lax biosafety standards in China. The dominant view among scientists worldwide was—and to some extent still is—that bat coronaviruses would most likely have to evolve in an intermediate animal first before they could infect humans. “Every institute’s biosafety committee has to balance the real risks with the potential risks,” says the University of Saskatchewan’s Rasmussen, adding that the Wuhan institute’s biosafety designation was reasonable at the time.\n\nChina’s high-level laboratories face other challenges besides the difficulty of making biosafety judgment calls. Money is one major issue. While there’s often ample funding to purchase cutting-edge equipment and build state-of-the-art laboratories such as the Wuhan institute’s BSL-4 facility, scientists often struggle for funding to train workers or to cover the cost of running those labs.\n\nSuch obstacles are hardly a secret. When the US embassy in Beijing sent a delegation to visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology in early 2018, managers of the institute lamented about them to embassy staff. And Yuan Zhiming, director of the BSL-4 facility, detailed the challenges of high-level biosafety laboratories in China in a paper in September 2019.\n\nSome have painted such challenges as a clear sign of lax standards. In an article published in April 2020, Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin wrote that after the US officials’ visit of the Wuhan institute in 2018 they “sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab.” According to Rogin, unnamed sources familiar with the unclassified cables “said that they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns,” and one anonymous Trump administration official told him the cables “provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.”\n\nThe newspaper column marked a turning point in the debate over covid-19’s origins, catapulting the lab leak theory into the mainstream. Several mainstream media outlets have used its assertions as evidence that the Wuhan institute has a record of “spotty” or “shoddy” biosafety practice.\n\nThe cables themselves, which were publicly released several months later (with some parts redacted), cautioned about inadequate staffing but didn’t identify any specific dangerous biosafety practices. One cable, sent on January 19, 2018, mentioned the shortage of trained staff “needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory” in a section that discussed how a lack of trained workers could “impede research.” According to the second cable sent three months later, this “opens up even more opportunities for expert exchange.” The January cable also noted the Wuhan institute’s ability “to undertake productive research despite limitations” and said that the work “makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.”\n\nSome scientists are appalled by what they perceive as misrepresentation of the embassy cables. “The concerns raised in the cable did not appear to focus on any specific safety concerns or egregious activities within the laboratory by current staff,” Jason Kindrachuk, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, told me in an email. It highlighted, he adds, how “these current limitations may be remedied through” additional help from the international community, including the US. In any case, Bill Hanage, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard, told me in an email that he doesn’t think the existence of the cables shed any light on the covid-19 origins debate.\n\nRogin told MIT Technology Review in an email that he stands by his reporting in his 2020 article.\n\nShi says that the lack of trained staff means that China cannot make the most out of the facility, but it doesn’t mean that it was using untrained personnel to work in BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs. The Wuhan institute, she adds, abides by the international norms of biosafety governance and that her research before the pandemic was geared toward bat viruses closely related to the original SARS virus. “RaTG13 was the closest SARS-CoV-2 relative we had ever had,” she said. “We could not have leaked what we did not have.”\n\nShi also denied suggestions that the first human infection could have involved someone from her team—who caught the virus either in the lab or in the field. Between the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan and the first vaccine shots, she told me, every member of her team was tested multiple times for viral nucleic acids to detect ongoing infections and for antibodies that would indicate past exposure. “Nobody was tested positive,” she said. “None of us has been infected by coronaviruses under any circumstances, including while sampling bats in the field.”\n\nPolitics of mistrust\n\nMany scientists are dismayed by the way Shi and the Wuhan Institute of Virology are often portrayed in Western media. Even those with no connection to Shi or the Wuhan institute—such as the University of Glasgow’s Robertson and the University of Saskatchewan’s Rasmussen—call it shockingly biased and say it is driven partly by geopolitical motives and deep-rooted prejudice.\n\nTo China experts like Joy Zhang, a sociologist at the University of Kent in Canterbury, UK, who specializes in science governance in China, it’s hard to separate the specific allegations against Shi from the general suspicions of China. “Shi is a victim of the Western mistrust of China and Chinese science,” she says.\n\nSuch mistrust of Chinese scientific practices is obvious among some. Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King’s College London, told me in February last year that “it’s simply too late” to find out what happened because “everything, for instance, in the Wuhan Institute of Virology freezers would have been cleared out. The data records would have been scrubbed or cleaned up.” She says it’s still her view now.\n\nShi finds Lentzos’s allegations that her lab would destroy critical records “baseless and appalling.”\n\n“If that’s what they think, then there is nothing we can do to convince them otherwise,” she told me. “Even if we gave them all the records, they would still say we have hidden something or we have destroyed the evidence.”\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak in 2002-’03, Chinese officials downplayed its extent for months until a prominent military surgeon blew the whistle. At the onset of covid-19, China also obscured information about the early cases and clamped down on domestic debate. This was exacerbated when, in March 2020, a number of Chinese ministries ruled that scientists had to seek approval to publish any work related to covid-19 research.\n\nMeanwhile, several Chinese institutions, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology, instructed their scientists—with rare exceptions—not to speak to the press. For some, this was something of a relief. Conducting interviews on politically sensitive subjects in English is prohibitively daunting to many Chinese speakers, as any language errors, especially regarding tenses and auxiliary verbs, can easily be misconstrued—with grave consequences. At the same time, many Chinese scientists had become reluctant to talk to Western journalists for more straightforward reasons: the majority of reporters who had contacted them, they said, didn’t seem to understand the intricacies of the science and showed strong preconceived ideas.\n\n“I just wanted to put my head down and concentrate on my work,” Shi told me. “I thought the storm would just blow over after some time.”\n\nSome of the Wuhan institute’s behavior has certainly raised red flags. In February 2020, for example, it took its virus databases offline, and they remain unavailable to outsiders—prompting some to suggest that they might contain information critical to covid-19’s origins. Shi told me that the part of the databases that had been publicly available before the pandemic contained only published information; the Wuhan institute, like research organizations in other parts of the world, had unpublished data that could be shared upon request via portals for academic collaborations. The institute, she says, took the databases offline because of security concerns; there had been thousands of hacking attempts since the beginning of the pandemic. “The IT managers were really worried somebody might sabotage the databases or, worse, implant virus sequences for malicious intent,” she said.\n\nInstead of tackling the publicity crisis directly, China has exacerbated mistrust by running obfuscation and disinformation campaigns of its own.\n\nStill, the University of Kent’s Zhang says, China’s behavior has to be understood in the country’s larger political, media, and cultural context. China, with its totally different media tradition, “has neither the vocabulary nor the grammar of the Western press to deal with a publicity crisis,” she told me. “The first instinct of Chinese officials is always to shut down communication channels.” To them, she said, this often seems safer than dealing with the situation proactively. Several top Chinese scientists, who asked not to be named for fear of political repercussions, told me that this also reflects a lack of confidence among China’s top leaders. “While eager to assert itself as a global power, China is still terribly insecure,” one of them said.\n\nInstead of tackling the publicity crisis directly, China has exacerbated mistrust by running obfuscation and disinformation campaigns of its own. Its foreign ministry, for instance, has insinuated that biomedical labs at a military base in Maryland may have created SARS-CoV-2 and leaked it to the public. Then there are the apparent falsehoods. The Chinese members of the WHO mission insisted in their report that “no verified reports of live mammals being sold [at the Huanan market] around 2019 were found.” In June, however, a paper published in Scientific Reports showed that many vendors sold live mammals illegally at several markets in Wuhan, including the Huanan market, just before the pandemic.\n\nMany scientists in the West are dismayed by such obfuscation. Even those who consider the lab leak theory highly unlikely are adamant that this behavior is unacceptable. “If China is lying about this, what else is it lying about?” says one virologist who strongly supports the natural origins theory.\n\nWu Zhiqiang—a virologist with the Beijing-based Institute of Pathogen Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and a member of the WHO mission—denies that his team lied. He told me that tracking down illegal wildlife trade was beyond the scope of the scientific mission. “We had to work with the information provided by the various ministries and were unable to verify the sale of live mammals at the Huanan market,” he says. Studies of disease origins, he adds, are always based on incomplete data, but Chinese scientists are following up clues to probe the market link: “It takes time and patience to learn the scientific truth.”\n\nAdding fuel to the mistrust, though, is the role of the EcoHealth Alliance’s Daszak. His close ties with Shi’s lab and his role as a member of the WHO mission’s international team are potentially in conflict. Critics say he can also be less than forthcoming. In February, for instance, he told several media outlets that he was impressed with China’s openness—at a time when the team was under tremendous pressure to conform to the Chinese narrative. While giving the impression that he knows very well what’s going on at the Wuhan institute, Daszak and his organization have also provided incorrect statements about its research activities.\n\nSuch incidents, critics say, have raised questions about whether Daszak had a disproportionate—or even misleading—role in the WHO mission. But scientists like the University of Utah’s Goldstein, who do not collaborate with Daszak, told me that there is no evidence that Daszak “wielded disproportionate influence” in the 11-member team.\n\nDaszak told me in an email that his potential conflicts of interest had been declared to the WHO before he joined the mission team. He says that there is lots of misreporting about him and his work in the media and that he is often not given the chance to respond to accusations. EcoHealth Alliance, he adds, has acted “with scientific integrity and honesty.”\n\n“It’s now over two years since the first efforts to willfully politicize the pandemic origins, and to undermine science and the work that scientists do in often difficult circumstances,” says Daszak. “All of us have lost due to this politicization. When you mix politics with science, you get politics.”\n\n“Clear and immediate threat”\n\nOn a hot July afternoon last year, I joined Shi and her team on a virus-hunting trip to a bat cave in Hubei province. (The team does not want the exact location of the cave disclosed, to avoid unwelcome media attention.) Dusk was falling fast, and the air smelled acrid and musty. Thousands of horseshoe bats clung to the cave ceiling—quiet, motionless, and evenly spaced out, like fighter jets on an airfield waiting for orders to take off.\n\nTo capture bats, researchers used a gigantic net made of fine nylon mesh suspended between two poles. Shi and Yang pushed the poles against the entrance of the cave, adjusting their position to cover the gaps between the net and the rocks. We switched off our headlamps and waited in the dark. Moments later, a fluttering sound ricocheted above us. A shadow swirled around and shot into the net, like insects flying into a spider web. The bat immediately got tangled. “Here we go,” shouted Shi. “Our first catch!”\n\nThe cave, at the bottom of a lush hill in a small village, is Shi’s home base. She uses it for sampling viruses, training students, and developing technologies that trace the movements of bats and the pathogens they carry. So far, it has yielded only distant relatives of known coronaviruses; their significance is unclear. (Bats in another cave in Hubei, however, have yielded SARS-like viruses.) “We are just collecting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle,” Shi told me. “We never know what will cause the next pandemic.”\n\nAnd the team keeps doing that work. The pandemic has lent extra urgency to one aspect of its research: determining the exposure risks that rural people face. In previous studies, Shi and her colleagues found that up to 4% of people living close to bats and working closely with wildlife in southern China were infected with dangerous animal-borne viruses, including coronaviruses; the infection rate was 9% among butchers. The Laotian and French team that discovered close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 found that one in five people who’d had direct contact with bats and other wildlife had coronavirus antibodies.\n\nTo watch out for viruses jumping between species, many scientists say, China should build on the WHO mission findings and set up long-term surveillance. Perhaps farms in southern China that supplied animals to the Huanan market should be a focus, or species known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, such as civets, minks, badgers, raccoon dogs, and people who live close to wildlife or work in the animal trade. This wouldn’t just help pin down the origins of covid-19, says Fabian Leendertz, an expert on zoonotic diseases and the founding director of the Helmholtz Institute for One Health in Greifswald, Germany, who was a member of the WHO mission. “It’s also about reducing the risk of the next pandemic,” he says . “It can help strengthen capacity building in neglected rural areas. It should be a concerted global effort.”\n\nBut such international collaborations with China are getting increasingly unlikely because of the allegations leveled at the Wuhan institute.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a WHO spokesperson, all hypotheses are still on the table and the lab leak theory would require further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving biosafety and biosecurity experts. Last November, the WHO put together an advisory group to probe the origins of covid-19 and future epidemics and to guide studies of emerging pathogens. The group, says the spokesperson, will release its first set of recommendations in the coming weeks.\n\nShi now realizes the controversial nature of her work and agrees that there’s an urgent need to step up regulation and oversight of risky research. She welcomes a broader societal debate about searching for new viruses in the wild and tampering with their genomes in the lab—which some biosafety experts ardently oppose. But “they don’t have to crucify me for that end,” she told me.\n\nAfter talking to dozens of scientists involved over the past year, it has become clear to me that people’s opinions about the lab leak theory, to a large extent, depend on whether or not they believe Shi. Some support her, partly because they know her as a person or understand her work, or because they are willing to put up with the messy reality of science and China’s lack of transparency. Others, possibly driven by a deep mistrust of China, grave biosafety concerns, or an intense desire for greater transparency, simply reject every piece of evidence that she offers to define her work, and regard any inconsistencies as deliberate attempts to cover up a crime.\n\nNot surprisingly, the allegations have taken a personal toll. “I’m a human being as well, you know,” Shi told me. “Have they considered what it feels like to be wrongly accused of unleashing a pandemic that has killed millions?”'}}",95.0,1

The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

The laureates are Dr. Katalin Karikó (68), an advisor to the German biotech company BioNTech and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA, and Dr. Drew Weissman (64), a professor at the same university. In a press conference on October 2, the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden highly praised the research achievements of the two scientists, stating, ""13 billion doses of the vaccine were administered worldwide, and this saved the lives of millions of people, allowing for society to return to normal.""\n\nDr. Karikó and her colleagues developed a technology that allows mRNA to enter the body without triggering an inflammatory response. They achieved this by replacing certain substances that make up mRNA. Based on this technology, BioNTech collaborated with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and US-based Moderna also developed a vaccine with a similar mechanism. At the end of 2020, less than a year from the start of development, the vaccine was put into practical use and has been widely used in various countries worldwide.\n\nDr. Karikó was born in Hungary during the Cold War and learned molecular biology while living a modest life. After struggling to immigrate to the USA, she met Dr. Weissman, and they continued their research together. Karikó was asleep early in the morning when she received the call from the Nobel Foundation. She later attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania and encouraged female students to follow in her footsteps.\n\nThe two researcher\'s technology allows for practical use of the vaccine in less than a year\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In Japan, the first infected person was confirmed in mid-January 2020, after the new year. The disease quickly spread to various European countries, the USA, and Asia. Meanwhile, the viral genome sequence was disclosed to the public shortly after the first confirmation of infection. Less than a year afterward, BioNTech and Pfizer developed mRNA vaccines. In December of the same year, vaccination with the Pfizer−BioNTech vaccine started in the UK, and the vaccine was quickly disseminated worldwide. Vaccination with the Moderna vaccine followed.\n\nVaccines that protect against viral infections have used viral proteins and other substances that are harmless to the human body to date. However, the drawback is that it takes time for such vaccine development and production (i.e., before practical application). The process typically requires 10 years. The accumulation of basic research on mRNA technology by Karikó and her team is behind the rapid practical application of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nmRNA serves as an \'intermediate\' in the synthesis of proteins based on genetic information encoded in DNA. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this property. Instead of injecting the viral protein itself, its \'blueprint\' is injected, allowing spike proteins to be produced in human cells. The host immune system recognizes this protein and produces antibodies to fight the real virus when it enters the body.\n\nEntering the human body through a \'replacement method\' without being recognized as a foreign substance\n\nUsing mRNA to create vaccines has been around since 1990. However, mRNA is easily degraded and is often considered a foreign substance by the body, leading to strong reactions like inflammation. This made its practical application difficult.\n\nAccording to organizations such as the Nobel Foundation, Karikó and Weissman, who were researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, began their comprehensive research in 1997 to solve the problems associated with the development of mRNA vaccines. They discovered that replacing uridine (a common mRNA component) with pseudouridine (a molecule commonly present in transfer RNA [tRNA]) prevents the mRNA from being recognized as a foreign substance in the human body. The paper on this \'replacement method\' was published in 2005. The two researchers repeated countless experiments before making this discovery.\n\nAs explained by a representative from the Karolinska Institutet at the press conference, ""Dr. Karikó, who is knowledgeable on mRNA, and Dr. Weissman, who has a deep knowledge of immunology, advanced their research by complementing each other\'s expertise.""\n\nWhat background did Dr. Karikó and Dr. Weissman each have, and how did they eventually meet and come to share the same fate of achieving research results that would save many people worldwide&quest; Looking at their backgrounds again, Karikó was born in Hungary on January 17, 1955, received her PhD from the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1982, and moved to the USA in 1985 after working at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. She served as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in the USA and as a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before joining BioNTech in 2013. She has concurrently served as a professor at the University of Szeged and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania since 2021.\n\nWeissman was born in the USA on September 7, 1959, graduated from Brandeis University in 1981, received his PhD in Immunology and Microbiology from Boston University in 1987, and served as an associate professor at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a professor in 2013.\n\nKarikó, whose research was terminated in her home country, also faced hardship in the USA\n\nKarikó was awarded the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2021 and the Japan Prize in 2022. She held an online lecture at the \'Science Agora 2021\' conference organized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in November 2021. She visited Japan many times for award ceremonies and lectures. In her lectures and media interviews, she looked back on her research career and shared stories regarding the difficulties and hardships she experienced before achieving success in mRNA vaccine research.\n\nAccording to Karikó and documents published about her, she was born in Szolnok, a rural city in Eastern Hungary. The city was devastated by air raids during World War II. However, the city was being rebuilt by the time she was born and growing up. Nonetheless, life was not easy, as supplies were scarce during the Cold War, and there was no running water or television. However, she described her days with her parents (who ran a butcher shop) and her younger sister as ""happy."" As a teenager, she enthusiastically studied biology with her parents\' encouragement. ""I was a curious child. At the age of 16, I decided to become a scientist,"" she mentioned in her acceptance speech for the Keio Medical Science Prize. She then enrolled at the University of Szeged, a university with a long tradition and outstanding achievements, to study molecular biology in depth.\n\nShe received her PhD from the same university and continued her research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. However, in 1985, when she was 30 years old, her research funding was terminated. She searched for research opportunities in European countries and found no institutions willing to accept her. When she found that only Temple University would accept her, she decided to move to the USA with her husband, who was an engineer, and their eldest daughter, who was 2 years old at the time. With only an estimated 200,000-yen equivalent in cash, she made a ""determined journey to the USA"" without considering returning to her homeland.\n\nTaking foreign currency out of Hungary was prohibited at the time. As the story goes, she concealed the cash in her daughter\'s stuffed teddy bear to bring to her new home. Her eldest daughter became a rower in the USA. She won two consecutive gold medals as a US national rowing team member at the Olympic Games in London in 2008 and in Beijing in 2012.\n\nKarikó then moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1989, where she met Weissman, who was working on an AIDS vaccine. Although she began in-depth research on the medical applications of mRNA, research on fragile mRNA did not gain widespread understanding. She experienced a difficult time when her grant funding was terminated. Nevertheless, she continued her research. However, even after she published a paper on mRNA vaccines in 2005, it initially did not garner much attention. Her research career was never smooth sailing.\n\nInteracting with Japanese researchers, and discoveries made by the late Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi contribute to Karikó\'s research.\n\nDr. Karikó repeatedly mentioned Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi in her lectures. Furuichi was a Japanese molecular biologist who passed away in October 2022 at the age of 81. Furuichi graduated from the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Toyama and received his PhD from the Graduate School of the University of Tokyo. He continued his research on mRNA at the National Institute of Genetics, where he discovered the \'cap\' structure at the tip of RNA in the mid-1970s. The structure was named after its cap-resembling shape.\n\nRNA will not function correctly without this structure. Compared with DNA studies, RNA research, especially mRNA research, has been less spectacular. However, mRNA cannot function without the cap structure, and proteins cannot be produced. For this reason, Furuichi\'s work is considered crucial and is said to have led to the practical application of mRNA vaccines. Unfortunately, Furuichi passed away last year without hearing the news of the Nobel Prize awarded to Karikó. However, he must have been pleased to see the worldwide dissemination of antiviral mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause of their similar research fields, Karikó had interactions with Professor Keiji Itaka, who conducts research on biofunctional restoration at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and Professor Ken J Ishii, who specializes in immunology at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo and is responsible for reviewing Karikó\'s papers. Osaka University posted a message on its website, stating, ""Dr. Karikó has deep connections with researchers at our university, and we at Osaka University, which has strongly promoted this research field for many years, sincerely congratulate both of the two scientists on this honor.""\n\nFurthermore, Director Emeritus/Professor Shinya Yamanaka of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University posted the following message on the Center\'s X (formerly Twitter) account: ""Congratulations on your award. I was deeply impressed after hearing that you have been persistent in your research when I had the opportunity to have a conversation with you. Your groundbreaking invention of the mRNA vaccine technology has saved many people.""\n\nMany of her close Japanese acquaintances have expressed their congratulations, and the common impressions they share are her ""friendly personality"" and ""persistence in diligently pursuing comprehensive research.""\n\nA meeting in line for the photocopier leads to discussion on \'research barriers\'\n\nAfter being selected for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023, Karikó told the Nobel Foundation in a telephone interview, ""At first, I thought someone was making a joke."" When it became clear that it was not a mistake, she and Weissman attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAt a press conference, Karikó happily recounted how she met Weissman while waiting in line for a photocopier in 1997. At that time, there were few photocopiers, and the waiting time became a great opportunity to exchange information. In their research, both researchers faced a wall. ""It was nice to talk about various ideas,"" she said. ""Although our laboratories were in different buildings, it was fun to start working together.""\n\nWeissman stated, ""(When I met Dr. Karikó,) I could not get research funding, and nobody was interested in my research. Clinical trials continued to fail. However, I met her, and we worked together for the next 20 years. We never gave up and persevered in our research patiently.""\n\nWhen asked by the moderator for her advice to female students, researchers, and others following in her footsteps, Karikó replied, ""If you want to be in the spotlight, become an actress. If you want to follow orders, the military would be a good choice. However, if you enjoy solving problems, science is for you.""\n\nHigh expectations for application of vaccines to various infectious diseases and cancer treatments\n\nAt a press conference for the Japan Prize laureates, Karikó mentioned their mRNA research, stating, ""We did not originally intend to create a vaccine. Instead, we continued our research, intending to use it for pharmaceuticals. The research to develop a COVID-19 vaccine stemmed from an ethical obligation (to save those infected).""\n\nAs a result, it protected many people worldwide from COVID-19 infection or from the disease becoming more severe. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the technology developed by Karikó and her colleagues ""played a crucial role in controlling the pandemic."" There is a high expectation that the technology they develop will have broad applications.\n\nThe Karolinska Institutet expects the technology to be applied to vaccines for malaria, influenza, and other infectious diseases, and cancer treatment. In her lecture explaining the research findings, Karikó presented research on vaccines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.\n\nThe institute also highly praised the achievements of the two scientists. However, at the press conference, questions were raised on the safety of mRNA vaccines. In response, a representative of the institute expressed an opinion, stating, ""13 billion people have already been vaccinated, and adverse reactions have been limited, and we do not consider them a significant concern. Actual infection with the novel coronavirus may have a higher risk of long-term health effects."" The representative further noted, ""We need to continue to explain how the mRNA vaccine works (in the body).""\n\nThe Nobel Foundation is known for not awarding any prize in the field of science to research findings that still have safety or ethical concerns. The decision to award a Nobel Prize at this time to the researchers behind the technology of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is a recognition of their safety. However, it means taking on the responsibility of awarding the Prize.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6319654/nobel-prize-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers/', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize Awarded to Work Behind COVID-19 Vaccine | TIME', 'Snippet': 'Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03046-x', 'Headline': 'Pioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Although COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.” Nature 622 , 228-229 (2023)', 'Full_text': 'This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to biochemist Katalin Karikó and immunologist Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccines have been administered billions of times, saved millions of lives and prevented millions of cases of severe COVID-19, said the Nobel committee.\n\nKarikó, who is at Szeged University in Hungary, and Weissman, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia (UPenn), paved the way for the vaccines’ development by finding a way to deliver genetic material called messenger RNA into cells without triggering an unwanted immune response.\n\nThey will each receive an equal share of the prize, which totals 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million).\n\nKarikó is the 13th female scientist to win a Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology (see ‘Nobel imbalance’). She was born in Hungary, and moved to the United States in the 1980s. “Hopefully, this prize will inspire women and immigrants and all of the young ones to persevere and be resilient. That’s what I hope,” she tells Nature.\n\nA new chapter\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and the Pfizer–BioNTech collaboration deliver mRNA that instructs cells to create copies of a protein that is found on SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, called the spike protein. This stimulates the body to make antibodies that target the protein, as well as triggering other immune responses.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nFor decades, mRNA vaccines were considered unfeasible because the injection of mRNA into the body triggered an immune reaction that immediately broke down the mRNA. In the mid-2000s, working at UPenn, Karikó and Weissman demonstrated that swapping one type of molecule in mRNA, called uridine, with a similar one called pseudouridine bypasses the cells’ innate immune defences1.\n\n“I’m delighted to see them recognized,” says Robin Shattock, a vaccine scientist at Imperial College London who has worked on mRNA vaccines. “Their contribution was really fundamental in the success of the COVID-19 vaccines, and I think will underlie RNA technology for some time to come.”\n\n“They demonstrated that changing the type of the RNA nucleotides within the vaccine altered the way in which cells see it,” said John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist at Imperial College London, in a press statement for the UK Science Media Centre. “This increased the amount of vaccine protein made following the injection of the RNA, effectively increasing the efficiency of the vaccination: more response for less RNA.”\n\n“This discovery has opened a new chapter for medicine,” said Nobel committee member Qiang Pan Hammarström, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference after the prize announcement. “Investment in long-term basic research is very important.”\n\nVaccine revolution\n\nThere are now mRNA vaccines in development for a number of other diseases, including influenza, HIV, malaria and Zika.\n\n“It’s really like a revolution starting since the COVID pandemic,” says Rein Verbeke, an mRNA vaccine researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. He adds that Karikó and Weissman’s contributions were essential to the vaccines’ success during the pandemic, and beyond. “Their part was really crucial to the development of this platform.”\n\nA COVID-19 mRNA vaccine containing unmodified RNA, developed by CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, was widely seen as a flop after its mediocre performance in clinical trials.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\nAnother key component of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that surround the modified RNA and ease its entry into cells. Numerous scientists contributed to the development of LNPs, says Verbeke, and it would have been nice if the Nobel committee had also recognized their contributions to mRNA vaccines. The modification of mRNA and the development of LNPs “were the two major steps that were necessary to have mRNA vaccines working”, he says.\n\nMany people were involved in developing LNPs, however, and it would be difficult to single out any one contribution, says Pierre Meulien, who worked on using mRNA to trigger immune responses in the 1990s at Transgène, a small biotech firm near Strasbourg in France. Karikó and Weissman “really created the key to success of the whole enterprise around mRNA vaccines”, he adds.\n\nThe development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics is still in its infancy, says Shattock. Scientists and biotechnology companies are busy coming up with new applications for mRNA technology, from cancer treatments to next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Many teams are also working on improved ways of delivering mRNA. “What we see used today is not what’s going to be used in the future,” he says. “We’re at the beginning of an RNA revolution.”\n\nAlthough COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/mrna-discovery-paved-way-covid-19-vaccines-wins-nobel-prize-physiology-medicine', 'Headline': 'mRNA discovery that paved way for COVID-19 vaccines wins ... - Science', 'Snippet': 'The seed for the mRNA vaccine idea was planted in the 1980s, following the development of techniques to generate the genetic strands in the lab. ...

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday. The economics prize is announced on Oct. 9.\n\nWinners of this year\'s Nobel Prizes will get an extra 1 million crowns compared to last year, partly because the Swedish crown has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the euro the past decade. The prize money of 11 million Swedish crowns is the equivalent of $1.36 million Cdn.\n\nThe Nobel prizes are presented to the laureates on Dec. 10.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03119-x', 'Headline': 'mRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Pioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel.

Yet the field shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nPioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel\n\nIn the wake of the technology’s dramatic success in generating quick-turnaround COVID-19 vaccines, investors have poured billions of dollars into expanding mRNA’s therapeutic reach.\n\nThis influx of cash promises to fuel the research and infrastructure needed to deploy mRNA medicines in ways that could transform public health by tackling hard-to-treat infectious diseases, cancers and rare genetic disorders.\n\n“The sky’s the limit,” says Matthias Stephan, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. “For whatever you want to correct, or whatever you want to treat, there could be an mRNA medicine — that’s the excitement.”\n\nNature spoke to researchers about mRNA medicines that are on the horizon.\n\nCurbing outbreaks: when speed is of the essence\n\nVaccines based on mRNA rose to fame not only for their safety and efficacy, but also for the speed with which they were developed and rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe approach allows researchers to have “a very potently effective vaccine in arms within weeks”, says Barney Graham, who helped to develop one of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines while at the US National Institutes of Health. (Graham now serves as senior adviser for global health equity at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.)\n\nHow COVID unlocked the power of RNA vaccines\n\nThe vaccines deliver mRNA that instructs a person’s cells to create copies of viral proteins, also known as antigens. This process stimulates the body to generate protective antibodies and virus-fighting immune cells.\n\nBecause synthetic mRNA can be designed and manufactured in days, the technology allows vaccines to be reformulated quickly each year to address the ever-evolving nature of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Or it can be deployed as a rapid-response tool in the face of new infectious threats. For example, Moderna, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has trialled mRNA vaccines against the monkeypox, Zika and Nipah viruses.\n\n“We can definitely take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of mRNA vaccine production,” says Norbert Pardi, a vaccine scientist at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia who has worked closely with the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — immunologist Drew Weissman, also at UPenn, and biochemist Katalin Karikó at the University of Szeged in Hungary. In the mid-2000s, the two laureates developed some of the foundational technology used to create mRNA vaccines.\n\nWily foes: tackling tough pathogens\n\nCompanies already have mRNA vaccines moving through the pipeline that target familiar pathogens. For instance, Moderna has a jab to protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which causes cold-like symptoms in most people but can be life-threatening to babies and older people — under review at the US Food and Drug Administration. Its public-health impact might be limited, however, because two protein-based vaccines beat it to approval.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nWhere the technology could really make a difference is with pathogens that drug firms haven’t been able to crack. One is cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that has eluded vaccine developers for more than 50 years and that causes birth defects in infants, as well as potentially deadly infections in people with compromised immune systems. “This is where mRNA has been quite a game-changer,” says Sallie Permar, a paediatric infectious-disease researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\n\nCMV uses a bundle of five proteins to enter and exit human cells, an antigen configuration that is difficult for protein-based vaccines to emulate. But with mRNA, researchers can simply provide the genetic instructions that a cell needs to produce the five proteins. The cell itself then does the heavy lifting of properly assembling the subunits into one antigen complex, just as happens during a natural infection.\n\nEarly results1 suggest that Moderna’s CMV vaccine, now in phase III trials, stimulates a stronger immune response in some tissues than do natural infections. “It’s an exciting time to end the most common cause of infectious disability,” says Permar, who has collaborated with Moderna to study the vaccine’s immune potential.\n\nCancer vaccines: the next frontier\n\nThe future of mRNA vaccines is not limited to infectious disease. “The next big thing is cancer, for sure,” says Derrick Rossi, interim chief executive at the New York Stem Cell Foundation in New York City and a co-founder of Moderna.\n\nThe lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines — and what it means for other diseases\n\nCancer researchers have long sought a vaccine that could be used to train the immune system to fight tumours — only to see promising candidates fail in clinical trials. Cancers have been a tough nut to crack because malignant cells mutate rapidly, weakening therapeutics’ power.\n\nWith mRNA, researchers can develop cancer vaccines that target dozens of antigens on tumour cells simultaneously. Hitting several targets at once could make it harder for cancer cells to evolve ways to evade immune responses elicited by a vaccine. Clinical trials of a new class of personalized cancer vaccine are under way: these vaccines use mRNA aimed at a collection of mutated proteins that are found in an individual’s own tumour.\n\nBut mRNA’s applications in cancer could have a wider reach, says Elad Sharon, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. “This is broader than just vaccines.”\n\nModerna is testing therapies that deliver mRNA instructions for making immune-stimulating molecules, such as cytokines, in cells to see whether they can amplify the effects of existing cancer immunotherapies2. And BioNTech, a biotechnology company in Mainz, Germany, is developing similar mRNA therapies that coax cells to generate antibodies that can help to rouse an immune response.\n\nGenome editing: improved delivery\n\nWhen researchers began working with mRNA as a therapeutic, the fact that the molecule could degrade quickly made it difficult to work with.\n\nWays of generating longer-lasting mRNA molecules could help. Yet, in some cases, mRNA’s fleeting nature is an advantage. When it comes to genome-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, researchers don’t want DNA-cutting enzymes to linger in the cell, because of the potential for unintended edits. mRNA represents a way to shuttle instructions for making the enzymes into cells and have them disappear after they’ve done their job.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\n“This is a perfect use of mRNA,” says Rossi, who co-founded a company called Intellia Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is using mRNA to deliver the gene-editing machinery needed to correct two rare diseases. “You want it around for a short while, you want it to do its job, and then you want it to go away.”\n\nOther companies, including one that Weissman co-founded called Capstan Therapeutics, are deploying mRNA to equip immune cells with enhanced disease-fighting functions. In these applications, the amount of protein elicited from mRNA is just enough to allow efficient editing or reprogramming, but not enough to introduce unwanted effects.\n\nAs researchers develop improved ways of targeting mRNA to desired locations in the body, its potential genome-editing applications will expand, says Lior Zangi, who studies mRNA therapeutics for heart regeneration at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “There’s a real possibility that this will lead to many new drugs for many different diseases,” he says. “That will be the real future.”'}}",99.16666666666667,1
