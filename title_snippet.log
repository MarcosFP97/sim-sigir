         User Queries: "['COVID surge most-vaxxed countries', 'COVID vaccination rates vs population density', 'Vaccination rates by urban-rural divide and COVID-19 cases', 'Vaccination rates versus hospitalization rates']"
         Search results: Title: "COVID-19 Data Comparing Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated Continue to Be ..." Snippet: "Hospitalization rates by vaccination status will be updated end of April and will include data through the end of March. These time frames allow the subject matter experts to process and complete ..."
Title: "How likely is COVID-19 hospitalization for vaccinated Americans? - USAFacts" Snippet: "Georgia counts anyone in a hospital who tests positive for COVID-19 as a COVID-19 hospitalization. Hospitalization rates in the state increased for everyone regardless of vaccination status during the Omicron wave. But the gap between the boosted population and the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated remained."
Title: "COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations by COVID-19 Vaccination Status and ..." Snippet: "During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for >50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July."
Title: "Notes from the Field: Comparison of COVID-19 Mortality Rates Among ..." Snippet: "Updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccines were first recommended by CDC on September 1, 2022.* An analysis of case and death rates by vaccination status shortly after authorization of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines showed that receipt of a bivalent booster dose provided additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated death (1).In this follow-up report on the durability of bivalent ..."
Title: "Impact of Vaccination on Cost and Course of Hospitalization Associated ..." Snippet: "To our knowledge, this is the first study in the United States to report the impact of vaccination on LOS and actual cost of COVID-19 hospitalization to the healthcare system. Patients who were fully vaccinated for COVID-19 experienced a shorter hospital LOS, lower rate of ICU admission, and less severe respiratory failure."
Title: "COVID-19–Associated Hospitalizations Among Adults During SARS-CoV-2" Snippet: "This analysis describes weekly hospitalization rates during Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods. Among nonpregnant and pregnant adults aged ≥18 years, ¶ hospitalization rates were calculated overall, and by race/ethnicity and COVID-19 vaccination status. Age-adjusted rates were calculated by dividing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 ..."
Title: "Comparing COVID-19-related hospitalization rates among ... - Nature" Snippet: "Compared with non-recent vaccine immunity, COVID-19-related hospitalization incidence rates were reduced by 89% (87–91%) for boosted vaccine immunity, 66% (50–77%) for infection-induced ..."
Title: "Analysis of Vaccination Rates and New COVID-19 ... - JAMA Network" Snippet: "In areas with vaccination rates lower than 30%, COVID-19 infections per 100 000 people increased from 190 infections (95% CI, 188-193 infections) ... and hospital staff shortages that can be associated with the successful distribution of vaccines and hence the vaccination campaign’s overall outcome. 5."
Title: "Public health impact of covid-19 vaccines in the US: observational ..." Snippet: "Incidence rate ratios were used to compare rates across vaccination coverage levels. The impact of a 10% improvement in county vaccination coverage (defined as at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine among adults ≥18 years of age) was estimated During the eras of alpha and delta variant predominance, the impact of very low (0-9%), low (10-39% ..."
Title: "Vaccination Status and Trends in Adult COVID-19-Associated ..." Snippet: "All other race and ethnicity groups had higher in-hospital mortality rates versus White persons (RR range: 1.4-2.9). Conclusions: Race/ethnicity disparities in COVID-19-associated hospitalizations declined but persist in the era of vaccination. Developing strategies to ensure equitable access to vaccination and treatment remains important."

         Search results: Title: ""Nuclear winter" would starve billions, but some countries may be spared" Snippet: "Ultimately, the study translated those crop reductions into total losses of calories produced, meaning the researchers could then estimate how many people would hypothetically succumb to famine in ..."
Title: "Global food insecurity and famine from reduced crop, marine fishery and ..." Snippet: "A war between the United States, its allies and Russia—who possess more than 90% of the global nuclear arsenal—could produce more than 150 Tg of soot and a nuclear winter 4,5,6,7,8,9."
Title: "Nuclear war would cause yearslong global famine - Science | AAAS" Snippet: "A few years after a nuclear war between the United States, its allies, and Russia, the global average calories produced would drop by about 90%—leaving an estimated 5 billion dead from the famine, the researchers report. A worst-case war between India and Pakistan could drop calorie production to 50% and cause 2 billion deaths."
Title: "How Search Engines Boost Misinformation | Scientific American" Snippet: "For example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.”"
Title: "Could Humans Grow Food During a Nuclear Winter?" Snippet: "A large-scale nuclear exchange of about 4,400 weapons between Russia and the United States (who possess more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear inventory) would send upwards of 165 million U.S. tons of soot into the upper atmosphere. That amount of soot is about 11 times the weight of the three Pyramids of Giza, the study notes for reference."
Title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Projected ..." Snippet: "The United States is gravely concerned by this dire projection and the significant scale of need throughout the country and region. This likely famine is the result of a combination of factors."
Title: "Secretary Blinken Intervention at a United Nations Security Council ..." Snippet: "Since January 2021, the United States has provided more than $17.5 billion to address famine and food insecurity. In 2021, in 2022, we convened this council to focus on the intersection between hunger and conflict."
Title: "A new study estimates as many as 5 billion could die in a nuclear ... - Vox" Snippet: "As a result, the researchers project that global calorie production could drop by as much as 90 percent, leaving an estimated 5 billion people dead from famine in what is now known as nuclear ..."
Title: "How would a nuclear winter impact food production?" Snippet: "Effects of a nuclear winter or other sky-darkening global catastrophes on farming and agriculture make it "imperative that we better understand our food production, supply and value chains to make them less vulnerable and more adaptable in times of crises," according to Penn State researchers who recently published a timely study on "Food Resilience in a Dark Catastrophe.""
