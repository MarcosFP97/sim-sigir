It had lasted 76 days — two and a half months during which no one was allowed to leave this industrial city of 11 million people, or even leave their homes. Until the Chinese government deployed this tactic, a strict batten-down-the-hatches approach had never been used before to combat a pandemic. Yes, for centuries infected people had been quarantined in their homes, where they would either recover or die. But that was very different from locking down an entire city; the World Health Organization called it “unprecedented in public health history.”\n\nThe word the citizens of Wuhan used to describe their situation was fengcheng — “sealed city.” But the English-language media was soon using the word lockdown instead — and reacting with horror. “That the Chinese government can lock millions of people into cities with almost no advance notice should not be considered anything other than terrifying,” a China human rights expert told The Guardian. Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told the Washington Post that “these kinds of lockdowns are very rare and never effective.”\n\nThe Chinese government, however, was committed to this “zero-COVID” strategy, as it was called. In mid-March 2020, by which time some 50 million people had been forced into lockdowns, China recorded its first day since January with no domestic transmissions — which it offered as proof that its approach was working. For their part, Chinese citizens viewed being confined to their homes as their patriotic duty.\n\nFor the next two years, harsh lockdowns remained China’s default response whenever there was an outbreak anywhere in the country. But by March 2022, when the government decided to lock down much of Shanghai after a rise in cases in that city, there was no more talk of patriotism. People reacted with fury, screaming from their balconies, writing bitter denunciations on social media, and, in some cases, committing suicide. When a fire broke out in an apartment building, residents died because the police had locked their doors from the outside. And when the Chinese government finally abandoned lockdowns — an implicit admission that they had not been successful in eliminating the pandemic — there was a wave of COVID-19 cases as bad as anywhere in the world. (To be fair, this was partly because China did such a poor job of vaccinating its citizens.)\n\nOne of the great mysteries of the pandemic is why so many countries followed China’s example. In the U.S. and the U.K. especially, lockdowns went from being regarded as something that only an authoritarian government would attempt to an example of “following the science.” But there was never any science behind lockdowns — not a single study had ever been undertaken to measure their efficacy in stopping a pandemic. When you got right down to it, lockdowns were little more than a giant experiment.\n\nDespite the lack of scientific evidence, lockdowns didn’t come out of nowhere, at least not in the U.S. They had been discussed — and argued over — by scientists since 2005, when (as the story goes) President George W. Bush read John M. Barry’s book The Great Influenza, about the 1918 pandemic. “This happens every hundred years,” Bush is supposed to have said after finishing the book. “We need a national strategy.”\n\nIn fact, there were people thinking about pandemic mitigation long before Bush read Barry’s book. The leader of this ad hoc group was D.A. Henderson, perhaps the most renowned epidemiologist of the 20th century — the man who, decades earlier, had led the team that eradicated smallpox. Richard Preston, the author of The Hot Zone, would later describe this feat as “arguably the greatest life-saving achievement in the history of medicine.”\n\nBy the time Bush began pushing his administration to come up with a pandemic plan, Henderson was 78 years old. Ten years earlier, he had sat in on a series of top-secret briefings where he listened to a Russian defector describe how he had led a team that was trying to adapt the smallpox virus for bioweapons. Henderson became so concerned that he started a small center focused on biodefense — which meant, in effect, defending against a pandemic. He and his colleagues at the center had spent years trying to persuade government officials to take pandemics seriously — without much success. When the Bush administration began debating what its pandemic strategy should include, it was only natural that Henderson be involved.\n\nThe men Bush chose to lead the effort believed that lockdowns could be an important component of a mitigation plan. They were heavily influenced by a model developed by Laura Glass, a 14-year-old high-school student from Albuquerque (aided by her scientist father), that purported to show that keeping people away from one another was as effective as a vaccine. (This story is told, overexcitedly, in Michael Lewis’s book The Premonition.)\n\nHenderson vehemently disagreed. For one thing, he didn’t trust computer models, which churned out estimates based on hypotheticals. Just as important, they couldn’t possibly anticipate the complexity of human behavior. “There is simply too little experience to predict how a 21st-century population would respond, for example, to the closure of all schools for periods of many weeks to months, or the cancellation of all gatherings of more than 1,000 people,” he said.\n\nIn addition, he felt that the worst thing officials could do was overreact, which could create a panic. In 2006, as the debate inside the Bush administration was nearing its conclusion, he co-authored a paper in a final effort to change the minds of those devising the strategy. The paper concluded: “Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted. Strong political and public health leadership to provide reassurance and to ensure that needed medical care services are provided are critical elements. If either is seen as less than optimal, a manageable epidemic could move towards catastrophe.”\n\nThe Bush team’s final document, published by the CDC in February 2007, stopped short of mandating lockdowns but came as close as its authors dared, calling for the use of “social distancing measures to reduce contact between adults in the community and workplace.” One of the leaders of the effort, a government scientist named Richard Hatchett, would later tell Lewis what he really believed: “One thing that’s inarguably true is that if you got everyone and locked each of them in their own room and didn’t let them talk to anyone, you would not have any disease.”\n\nWhich is true as far as it goes. There were other questions, though, that were at least as relevant. Could the kinds of lockdowns that are achievable in the real world, where hundreds of millions of people can’t live in isolation chambers, be an effective tool against a pandemic? Did the virus truly go away during a lockdown or simply hide, waiting to reemerge when it ended? And finally, did the many social, economic, and medical downsides make them, in the aggregate, not worth whatever short-term benefits they might yield?\n\nHenderson, who died in 2016, never stopped making the latter case. “D.A. kept saying, ‘Look, you have to be practical about this,’” says his former deputy, Tara O’Toole. “‘And you have to be humble about what public health can actually do, especially over sustained periods. Society is complicated, and you don’t get to control it.’”\n\nAs the United States gains more and more distance from the COVID pandemic, the perspective on what worked, and what did not, becomes not only more clear, but more stark. Operation Warp Speed stands out as a remarkable policy success. And once the vaccines became available, most states did a good job of quickly getting them to the most vulnerable, especially elderly nursing-home residents.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no shortage of policy failures of which to take stock. We do an accounting of many of them in our new book, The Big Fail. But one that looms as large as any, and remains in need of a full reckoning in the public conversation, is the decision to embrace lockdowns. While it is reasonable to think of that policy (in all its many forms, across different sectors of society and the 50 states) as an on-the-fly experiment, doing so demands that we come to a conclusion about the results. For all kinds of reasons, including the country’s deep political divisions, the complexity of the problem, and COVID’s dire human toll, that has been slow to happen. But it’s time to be clear about the fact that lockdowns for any purpose other than keeping hospitals from being overrun in the short-term were a mistake that should not be repeated. While this is not a definitive accounting of how the damage from lockdowns outweighed the benefits, it is at least an attempt to nudge that conversation forward as the U.S. hopefully begins to recenter public-health best practices on something closer to the vision put forward by Henderson.\n\nAfter China came Italy, the second country to be hit hard by the coronavirus. The Italian government responded with a lockdown almost as tough as China’s. By the time it was lifted, in early June, 34,000 Italians had died of COVID-19, up from 630 when the lockdown was first imposed.\n\nThose were frightening numbers. But when Neil Ferguson saw what had transpired in Italy, he saw an opportunity. For Ferguson, the head of the infectious disease department at Imperial College London, the Italian government’s decision to follow China’s example meant that lockdowns were suddenly a real-world policy option in Western democratic societies, not just in an authoritarian country like China. As a disease modeler, he believed the same thing Richard Hatchett believed: that if he could lock everyone in a room, the virus would go away. But he had long assumed attempting to do so was politically impossible.\n\nFerguson is an important epidemiologist, renowned for his estimates, derived from computer models, of possible deaths from a newly emerged virus. As soon as he learned of the outbreak in Wuhan, he and several colleagues began modeling the coronavirus. On March 17, Ferguson laid out the team’s findings at a press conference. Their model predicted that, without serious countermeasures, a staggering 81 percent of the population in the U.S. and Britain would become infected, and that 510,000 people in Britain and 2.2 million Americans would die of COVID by late 2020. In addition, the authors wrote, “We predict critical care bed capacity would be exceeded as early as the second week in April, with an eventual peak in ICU or critical bed care demand that is over 30 times greater than the maximum supply in both countries.”\n\nFor Ferguson, the purpose of the report wasn’t just to release their shocking estimates; it was also to push the American and British governments to commit to lockdowns for the long haul. “[T]his type of intensive intervention package,” the authors wrote, “will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) — given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.”\n\nIt worked. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson had initially planned to keep the country open. Instead, he ordered a lockdown within a week of Ferguson’s press conference. (Shortly after Johnson imposed the lockdown, Ferguson was visited twice by his mistress. For obvious reasons, this caused a furor when it was discovered. Ferguson was the first, though hardly the last, Establishment bigwig to ignore the COVID-19 rules they demanded of everyone else.)\n\nAs for President Donald Trump, he never used the word lockdown, but he was worried enough to call for the country to adopt social distancing as a mitigation strategy. Schools, restaurants, businesses — they all closed. White-collar employees who were able to work from home did so. More than once, Trump mentioned that 2.2 million lives were at stake, referring to Ferguson’s estimate. Trump’s order wound up lasting six weeks.\n\nMost governors issued their own “stay-at-home” orders, usually stricter than Trump’s. Even Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida — who would soon become an outspoken opponent of mainstream mitigation measures — reluctantly went along for a brief period. But there were important questions that no one advocating for lockdowns addressed, maybe because in the urgency of the moment the questions didn’t occur to them. How long would they last? And even if lockdowns did slow the virus’s progression, what would happen when they were lifted?\n\nRegardless, in the space of two months, lockdowns had gone from being unthinkable to being an unquestioned tool in the pandemic toolkit.\n\nWhen state public health officials explained to the country’s governors why lockdowns were necessary, they talked primarily about “bending” or “flattening the curve.” And when governors then explained the strategy to their constituents, they used the same rationale. “If we change our behaviors,” said California governor Gavin Newsom in announcing his state’s lockdown on March 19, “we can truly bend the curve to reduce the need to surge.” The day after Newsom, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a lockdown plan for New York. He called it his PAUSE program — Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone — but really, it was the same thing.\n\nWhat did flattening the curve mean? Here’s what it didn’t mean: It did not mean that if people stayed in their homes, COVID-19 would fade away (even if that idea was often suggested in non-expert contexts). Rather, flattening the curve meant delaying the virus spread to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID patients. During their early press conferences, many governors would display a chart showing a sharp increase in the estimated rate of COVID-19 infections. That’s what would happen without lockdowns, they explained. Then they would display a second chart showing a more gradual upturn once lockdowns and other mitigation measures took effect. Simply put, flattening the curve was about helping hospitals manage the crisis rather than ending the crisis. Even those who later criticized lockdowns largely agreed on this point. As David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 envoy (and an eventual lockdown critic), put it, “The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large we’d rather not do it.”\n\nIn many blue states, however, that rationale was forgotten over time, and many people remained confined to their homes or apartments not just for a few weeks but for a year or more — even after the vaccine became available. And many of the country’s biggest cities continually reimposed lockdowns whenever there was an uptick in COVID cases — not just telling people to shelter in place, but also closing small businesses and restaurants, outlawing sports events and social gatherings, and shutting down in-school learning.\n\nWhich naturally leads to the obvious question: Did lockdowns help keep Americans alive? Studies were mixed — in their findings, their methodology, even their definition of lockdown. For instance, in August 2020, eClinicalMedicine, an offshoot of the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet, printed a study that concluded that “full lockdowns and wide-spread COVID-19 testing were not associated with reductions in the number of critical cases or overall mortality.” In March 2021, Christian Bjørnskov, an economist at Aarhus University in Denmark, compared weekly mortality rates in 24 European countries that used mitigation measures with varying degrees of severity. “[T]he findings in this paper suggest that more severe lockdown policies have not been associated with lower mortality,” the economist wrote. “In other words,” he added, “the lockdowns have not worked as intended.”\n\nMichael Osterholm, the prominent epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, also doesn’t think lockdowns did any good. “There is actually no role for lockdowns,” he says. “Look at what happened in China. They locked down for years, and when they finally relaxed that effort, they had a million deaths in two weeks.” As for flattening the curve, “that’s not a real lockdown,” Osterholm says. “You’re just reducing contact for a few weeks to help the hospitals.”\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci was probably the best-known defender of lockdowns as a life-saving measure. But the policy continues to have many defenders within the public health establishment. Howard Markel, a doctor and medical historian at the University of Michigan, believes they succeeded. “The amount of lives saved was just incredible,” he says. Markel pointed to an August 2023 study by the Royal Society of London that concluded that “stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and restrictions on gathering size were repeatedly found to be associated with significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with more stringent measures having greater effects.”\n\nStill, the weight of the evidence seems to be with those who say that lockdowns did not save many lives. By our count, there are at least 50 studies that come to the same conclusion. After The Big Fail went to press, The Lancet published a study comparing the COVID infection rate and death rate in the 50 states. It concluded that “SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths disproportionately clustered in U.S. states with lower mean years of education, higher poverty rates, limited access to quality health care, and less interpersonal trust — the trust that people report having in one another.” These sociological factors appear to have made a bigger difference than lockdowns (which were “associated with a statistically significant and meaningfully large reduction in the cumulative infection rate, but not the cumulative death rate”).\n\nIn all of this discussion, however, there is a crucial fact that tends to be forgotten: COVID wasn’t the only thing people died from in 2020 and 2021. Cancer victims went undiagnosed because doctors were spending all their time on COVID patients. Critical surgeries were put on hold. There was a dramatic rise in deaths due to alcohol and drug abuse. According to the CDC, one in five high-school students had suicidal thoughts during the pandemic. Domestic violence rose. One New York emergency-room doctor recalls that after the steady stream of COVID patients during March and April of 2020, “our ER was basically empty.” He added, “Nobody was coming in because they were afraid of getting COVID — or they believed we were only handling COVID patients.”\n\nSo in attempting to gauge the value of lockdowns, the most appropriate way is to look not just at COVID deaths but at all deaths during the pandemic years. That’s known as the “excess deaths” — a measure of how many more people died than in a normal year. One authoritative accounting was compiled by The Spectator using data gathered by the OECD. It showed that during the first two years of the pandemic — 2020 and 2021 — the U.S. had 19 percent more deaths than it normally saw in two years’ time. For the U.K., there was a 10 percent rise. And for Sweden — one of the few countries that had refused to lock down its society — it was just 4 percent. An analysis by Bloomberg found broadly similar results. In other words, for all the criticism Sweden shouldered from the world’s public health officials for refusing to institute lockdowns, it wound up seeing a lower overall death rate during the pandemic than most peer nations that shut down schools and public gatherings. It is not unreasonable to conclude from the available data that the lockdowns led to more overall deaths in the U.S. than a policy that resembled Sweden’s would have.\n\nThere were other negative consequences too. In the U.S., lockdowns forced hundreds of thousands of small business closures. They exacerbated inequality, as Amazon warehouse workers and meatpackers showed up to crowded workplaces while the “Zoom class” locked down at home. Worst of all, though, it had a devastating effect on children whose schools were closed as part of a lockdown. During the first weeks of the pandemic it probably made sense to close schools given how little was known about the coronavirus. Better safe than sorry. But by the time school started up again in the fall of 2020, two things were clear. The first was that remote learning was a disaster. The second was that there was surprisingly little transmission among kids in school. Well-to-do parents moved their children to private schools, many of which reopened their classrooms. But most big-city public-school systems continued to rely on remote learning well into the 2020–2021 school year. It was a tragic policy choice.\n\nIn ProPublica and The New Yorker, the journalist Alec MacGillis vividly described the consequences in Baltimore. With no classrooms to go to, thousands of students abandoned school. The school system made free laptops available, but few students took the trouble to get one. Teachers gave up trying to prod those who didn’t log onto their remote classes. Plus, teachers had kids of their own to take care of, which made it difficult to teach.\n\nThe anti-lockdown scientist Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University recalls a photograph in the San Jose Mercury News during the early months of the pandemic. It showed two children, 7 or 8 years old, sitting with Google Chromebooks outside a Taco Bell. “They were on the sidewalk doing schoolwork because that was the only place they could get free Wi-Fi,” Bhattacharya said. “Their parents weren’t there because they had to go to work. I mean, that should have ended the lockdown right then and there. It should have at least ended school closures.”\n\nPublic schools have an importance that goes beyond education. It’s where many of the rituals of childhood and young adulthood take place. For children who live in unstable homes, school offers some stability. Public schools serve free breakfast and lunch to disadvantaged kids. And they’re a place where parents know their children are safe when they’re at work. One consequence of lockdowns was that millions of children had to fend for themselves because their parents couldn’t afford to quit their jobs to take care of them.\n\nOne child psychiatrist, who works with underprivileged autistic kids, began the pandemic believing in the importance of lockdowns and other mitigation measures. But over time, she changed her mind.\n\n“What really drove me was my clinical experience,” she said. “What happens to a child when every single support is removed from them? What’s the impact on the family and the siblings? What I was seeing was complete regression. It was devastating, and the downsides of lockdowns and school closings were not being openly discussed in the mainstream media. I was horrified. Why aren’t we talking about this?” She described the situation she saw as 2022 wore on as a “sickening mental-health crisis.”\n\nThe science also weighed heavily in favor of opening schools. By mid-summer 2020, when cities were trying to decide whether to reopen schools in September, 146,000 Americans had died of COVID-19. Fewer than 20 were children between the ages of 5 and 14. More schoolchildren died from mass shootings in a typical year. Emily Oster, a Brown University economist, conducted a survey of about 200,000 children who were back in classrooms. The infection rate, she discovered, was 0.13 percent among students and 0.24 percent among teachers — an astonishing low number. Oster then set up what she called the National COVID-19 School Response Dashboard, which eventually tracked 12 million kids in both public and private schools and continued to collect infection-rate data over the next nine months. Not once did the student rate hit one percent during any two-week span.\n\n“We do not want to be cavalier or put people at risk,” Oster wrote in The Atlantic. “But by not opening, we are putting people at risk, too.”\n\nOver the entirety of the pandemic, the essential facts about schools never changed. The infection rate for teachers in Sweden, where most schools stayed open, was no higher than the infection rate for teachers in Finland, which had closed its schools. In early 2021, three CDC scientists acknowledged in the Journal of the American Medical Association: “As many schools have reopened for in-person instruction in some parts of the U.S. … there has been little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.”\n\nSo why did so many big-city schools stay closed long after the evidence was clear? There were three reasons. The first, and most understandable, was fear. No matter how small the chance, no parent wanted his or her child to die from COVID-19. And no teacher wanted to become infected while in school and bring COVID-19 home. Because kids often brought colds and flus to school — which then spread to others — both parents and teachers had a hard time accepting that that was not how the virus spread. Here, for instance, was a typical comment from a teacher in Westchester, reacting to a series of New York Times’ articles about reopening schools:\n\nTell me how to get a 6-year-old to not sneeze on his friends let alone play and work from a distance (mucus, saliva, pee, poop, this is all part of our day at the lower levels of education). Tell me how each child is going to have her own supplies for the day as shared supplies are no longer an option. No more Legos, no more books. Tell me how to comfort a hysterical child from a distance of six feet.\n\nThat it was well established that the coronavirus was not spread through saliva or pee or by sharing books didn’t matter. Too many people were simply unable to judge risk rationally — a problem due in part to unwillingness of government officials to talk honestly about COVID-19. In 2020, for instance, COVID-19 ranked below suicide, cancer, accidents, homicide, and even heart disease as a cause of death for children under the age of 15, according to CDC data. Yet public-health experts did not stress any of this — on the contrary, many of them emphasized instead that children could get COVID-19 without explaining how small the risk was. Is it any wonder, then, that COVID-19 seemed to be the only thing parents and teachers focused on?\n\nThe second factor was Trump. On July 6, he tweeted, “SCHOOLS MUST REOPEN IN THE FALL!!” The next day, at a White House event, the president said, “We’re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. It’s very important for our country. It’s very important for the well-being of the student and the parents.”\n\nIn this case, Trump happened to be right; it was important. But by this late stage in his presidency, most Democrats assumed that anything he said was a lie. If Trump said schools should reopen, that was reason enough for them to assume they should stay closed. The sense that opening up was a Trump-endorsed policy seems to have energized opposition to it in blue America — even as data accumulated that the harm being done to the country’s children outweighed any potential benefit.\n\nThe third reason was the teachers’ unions. Public-school teachers were unionized, and their unions — American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA) — were allies of, and contributors to, the Democratic Party, which dominated most major urban areas. They held enormous sway over big-city school systems.\n\nNo one can doubt that teachers were afraid of dying of COVID-19. They truly believed they were putting themselves in harm’s way if they went back into a classroom full of children. But instead of helping their members see how small the risk truly was, the teachers’ unions embraced the fight to keep teachers away from the classroom.\n\nBy the time September 2020 rolled around, at least a dozen of America’s biggest cities started the school year remotely. They included Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Houston — all cities with the kind of large, disadvantaged communities that would suffer the most if schools were closed. In most cases, city officials said they were trying to move from remote learning to at least a hybrid model, in which students would spend several days a week in classrooms and the rest of the week online.\n\nIn school districts that did open their schools that fall, the results were remarkably aligned with Emily Oster’s data. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio was finally able to get the schools open in late September; between Thanksgiving and the end of the year, the city’s positivity rate rose from 3 percent to 6 percent. The positivity rate in the public schools also rose — from 0.28 percent to 0.67 percent. “The safest place in New York City is, of course, our public schools,” said de Blasio. To the holdout unions, those numbers didn’t matter. Ultimately, only 15 percent of school districts offered full-time classroom instruction during the fall 2020 semester.\n\nBy 2022, journalists, academics, and even some public-health officials were finally coming to grips with the enormous damage done to children — especially disadvantaged children — because of remote learning. A lengthy analysis by two professors in The Atlantic toted up some of the issues. First, millions of kids simply gave up on learning. In New York, even after schools had reopened, the chronic absentee rate was 40 percent — up from 26 percent before the pandemic. Studies showed that public-school children got less exercise (no recess) and ate more junk food (no free hot meals) during the pandemic. According to a CDC survey, during the first six months of 2021, nearly half the high-school students surveyed “felt persistently sad or helpless.” Parental emotional abuse was four times higher than in 2013, and parental physical abuse nearly doubled, The Atlantic reported.\n\nA study by three major research institutions, including Harvard’s Center for Education Policy Research, showed that the longer a school relied on remote learning, the further behind their students were. “In high-poverty schools that were remote for more than half of 2021, the loss was about half of a school year’s worth of typical achievement growth,” said Thomas Kane, the director of the Harvard center.\n\nAlthough test scores in 2023 would suggest that students were slowly catching up, those scores didn’t take into account the kids who had dropped out entirely. One analysis found an estimated 230,000 students in 21 states whose absences could not be accounted for. They had simply gone missing.\n\n“The pandemic has amounted to a comprehensive assault on the American public school,” concluded the authors of The Atlantic article. Yet as late as the fall of 2022, there were still those who refused to acknowledge the damage done by lengthy school closings.\n\nOne such person was Anthony Fauci. In August 2022, Fauci announced that he planned to retire at the end of the year. Over the next few months, he made the rounds to discuss how the country had fared during the pandemic. Invariably, he was asked whether he regretted his forceful advocacy of lockdowns, especially given its effect on children. At one forum, he said, “Sometimes when you do draconian things, it has collateral negative consequences … on the economy, on the schoolchildren.” But, he added, “The only way to stop something cold in its tracks is to try and shut things down.”\n\nWhat he could never acknowledge was that “shutting things down” didn’t stop the virus, and that keeping schools closed didn’t save kids’ lives. Then again, to understand that, you had to be willing to follow the science.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-shanghai-government-and-politics-e40fb7fdd74f395571b7604fa6ee5d3e', 'Headline': 'Under COVID lockdown, Xinjiang residents complain of hunger', 'Snippet': 'FILE - Aerial photo shows a community testing site for COVID-19 in Wudang District of Guiyang, southwest China’s Guizhou Province, Sept. 5, 2022.

(Yang Ying/Xinhua via AP ...', 'Full_text': 'BEIJING (AP) — Residents of a city in China’s far western Xinjiang region say they are experiencing hunger, forced quarantines and dwindling supplies of medicine and daily necessities after more than 40 days in a virus lockdown.\n\nHundreds of posts from Ghulja riveted users of Chinese social media last week, with residents sharing videos of empty refrigerators, feverish children and people shouting from their windows.\n\nThe dire conditions and food shortages are reminiscent of a harsh lockdown in Shanghai earlier this year, when thousands of residents posted complaints online that they were delivered rotting vegetables or denied critical medical care.\n\nBut unlike in Shanghai, a glittering, cosmopolitan metropolis of 20 million people and home to many foreigners, the harsh lockdowns in smaller cities such as Ghulja have received less attention until recently.\n\nAs more infectious variants of the coronavirus creep into China, flareups have become increasingly common. Under China’s “zero-COVID” strategy, tens of millions or people are experiencing rolling lockdowns, paralyzing the economy and making travel uncertain.\n\nThe lockdown in Ghulja is also evoking fears of police brutality among the Uyghurs, the Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang. For years, the region has been the target of a sweeping security crackdown, ensnaring huge numbers of Uyghurs and other largely Muslim minorities in a vast network of camps and prisons. An earlier lockdown in Xinjiang was particularly tough, with forced medication, arrests and residents being hosed down with disinfectant.\n\nYasinuf, a Uyghur studying at a university in Europe, said his mother-in-law sent fearful voice messages this past weekend saying she was being forced into centralized quarantine because of a mild cough. The officers coming for her reminded her of the time her husband was taken to a camp for over two years, she said.\n\n“It’s judgment day,” she sighed in an audio recording reviewed by The Associated Press. “We don’t know what’s going to happen this time. All we can do now is to trust our creator.”\n\nFood has been in short supply. Yasinuf said his parents told him they were running low on food, despite having stocked up before the lockdown. With no deliveries, and barred from using their backyard ovens for fear of spreading the virus, his parents have been surviving on uncooked dough made of flour, water and salt. Yasinuf declined to give his surname for fear of retribution against his relatives.\n\nHe hasn’t been able to study or sleep in recent days, he said, because thoughts of his relatives back in Ghulja keep him up at night.\n\n“Their voices are always in my head, saying things like I’m hungry, please help us,” he said. “This is the 21st century, this is unthinkable.”\n\nNyrola Elima, a Uyghur from Ghulja, said her father was rationing their dwindling supply of tomatoes, sharing one each day with her 93-year-old grandmother. She said her aunt was panicking because she lacked milk to feed her 2-year-old grandson.\n\nLast week, the local governor apologized at a news conference for “shortcomings and deficiencies” in the government’s response to the coronavirus, including “blind spots and missed spots,” and promised improvements.\n\nBut even as authorities acknowledged the complaints, censors worked to silence them. Posts were wiped from social media. Some videos were deleted and reposted dozens of times as netizens battled censors online.\n\nMultiple people in the region told AP the posts online reflected the dire nature of the lockdown, but declined to detail their own situations, saying they feared retribution.\n\nOn Monday, local police announced the arrests of six people for “spreading rumors” about the lockdown, including posts about a dead child and an alleged suicide, which they said “incited opposition” and “disrupted social order.”\n\nLeaked directives from government offices show that workers are being ordered to avoid negative information and spread “positive energy” instead. One directed state media to film “smiling seniors” and “children having fun” in neighborhoods emerging from the lockdown.\n\n“Those who maliciously hype, spread rumors, and make unreasonable accusations should be dealt with in accordance with the law,” another notice warned.\n\nThe AP was unable to independently verify the notices. China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the authorities mobilize, conditions have improved for some. One resident, reached by phone, said food deliveries resumed after stopping for a couple of weeks. Residents in her compound are now allowed to take walks in their courtyard for a few hours a day.\n\n“The situation is gradually improving, it’s gotten a lot better,” she said.\n\nAuthorities have ordered mass testing and district lockdowns in cities across China in recent weeks, from Sanya on tropical Hainan island to southwest Chengdu, to the northern port city of Dalian.\n\nIn the city of Guiyang, in mountainous southern Guizhou province, a zoo put out a call for help last week, asking for pork, chicken, apples, watermelons, carrots and other produce out of concern they could run out of food for their animals.\n\nElsewhere in the city, residents in one neighborhood complained of hunger and missing food deliveries, prompting a surge of comments online. Local officials apologized, saying that despite their best efforts, they were overwhelmed.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2022-un-report--global-hunger-numbers-rose-to-as-many-as-828-million-in-2021', 'Headline': 'UN Report: Global hunger numbers rose to as many as 828 million in 2021', 'Snippet': 'The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.', 'Full_text': ""The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.\n\nThe 2022 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report presents updates on the food security and nutrition situation around the world, including the latest estimates of the cost and affordability of a healthy diet. The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/china-shanghai-covid-lockdown-food-shortage/', 'Headline': ""Shanghai's covid lockdown: food shortages, drones, starving animals ..."", 'Snippet': 'Li’s boyfriend — who is from Wuhan, where covid was first detected and 11 million people experienced an unprecedented 76-day lockdown — argued in favor of the swift and harsh lockdowns. [A ...', 'Full_text': 'For weeks, China’s most populous city, Shanghai, has been under strict lockdown orders in an effort to control a coronavirus outbreak. Its 25 million residents have been trapped at home, struggling to feed themselves or get medical help for sick family members. Others have been corralled into makeshift quarantine centers and temporary hospitals, unsure when they will be allowed to leave.\n\nLi Moyin, 34, was among those restricted to their homes. She lives with her parents, both in their 70s, in the Putuo district of Shanghai, where she has been confined since March 27, working as a part-time translator and trying to secure enough groceries for their household. For Li, who grew up in Shanghai, seeing the once-bustling financial hub — which residents previously believed was a model for balancing covid prevention measures with normal life — turn into a ghost town has been unsettling.\n\nTalking over text and video calls with her boyfriend under lockdown elsewhere in the city, Li has spent hours debating whether such drastic measures are necessary, especially when the majority of Shanghai’s cases are patients without severe symptoms. Li’s boyfriend — who is from Wuhan, where covid was first detected and 11 million people experienced an unprecedented 76-day lockdown — argued in favor of the swift and harsh lockdowns.\n\n[A year after Wuhan coronavirus lockdown, trauma runs deep in China’s ‘Hero City’]\n\nThe prospect of a long lockdown has started to take an emotional toll. One video shared widely shows residents of a large apartment compound in Putuo screaming from their balconies. In the video, a bystander can be heard saying, “That whole building is screaming. ... What’s the root problem? People don’t know how long this situation will last.”\n\nUnder government rules, the almost 300,000 residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus since early March and their close contacts must be sent to mass quarantine centers or to hospitals, depending on the severity of their symptoms. Many residents fear this more than getting the virus, unwilling to be confined in the quickly built temporary field hospitals, some of them repurposed schools or construction sites. They often do not have doctors and nurses on hand or private facilities for sleeping or bathing.\n\nVideos have shown people fighting over stretched-thin supplies, trying to plug leaks, and in some cases attempting to escape centers. On Thursday, residents at an apartment complex in the Zhangjiang high-tech park in Pudong clashed with police after authorities said the compound would be converted into an isolation site. Footage posted online showed police dragging residents away as a woman begs them to stop and bystanders yell, “Why are you hitting old people? Let them go!”\n\nThe rest of the city must stay home under orders enforced by community workers and police. Drones fly above, communicating with the public or sometimes delivering medicine to the elderly — adding to the eerie emptiness of a city on pause.\n\nOnly health-care workers, delivery drivers and volunteers can move freely. Robots patrolling the street encourage residents to disinfect their homes, avoid gatherings and “remain civilized”.\n\nThe measures, which began in phases in late March before being extended across the city in early April, gave residents and officials little time to prepare. Food shortages are rife across the city. Restrictions have caused supply chain bottlenecks and strained the neighborhood committees that are responsible for looking after the locked-down residents. Many like Li have had to rely entirely on themselves to figure out how to survive.\n\n“We were in limbo, and many including my parents felt betrayed. It was painful for them to wake up to the fact that we were left on our own,” Li said.\n\nThe reality does not match up with the official narrative of ample food and medical supplies. Wu Peiying, 27, who works in business development, noticed an article on WeChat last week that showcased her neighborhood as a success story. Local party propaganda praised the neighborhood committee of Changfeng Xincun, where Wu lives, for sending 25,000 packages of food a day to the 100,000 residents in her area in western Shanghai.\n\nBut in the last two weeks, Wu said, she only received one package: a plastic bag containing one carrot, a cabbage, a yam and a few chicken wings that had already gone bad.\n\nResidents have tried to bring their grievances to officials. When Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang visited residents this week, videos posted on social media showed elderly women confronting the senior official about the lack of food.\n\nOthers showed residents shouting from their windows: “Save us. We don’t have enough to eat.""\n\nWu, like many Shanghai residents, has to rely on “group buying,"" teaming up with neighbors to source supplies and order in bulk. As the head of that effort for more than 350 people in her residential compound, Wu must verify sellers, negotiate prices, and ensure delivery workers have the right passes to travel to the compound and drop off the goods.\n\n“Every day I have to ask around for connections to buy rice or hazmat suits,” she said. “Why are we the ones to bear these responsibilities?” she said. Wu shared screenshots of her recent efforts to secure packages of rice, purchased a week ago, for the group.\n\nAshley Chi, a 28-year-old product manager at a tech company in Shanghai, said her neighbors leave supplies outside their doors for each other — she left extra sanitary napkins outside hers — and barter among themselves. Chi recently traded about one cup of soy sauce for five liters of bottled water.\n\n“At first, he wanted to pay me, but who needs money now? I need water!” she said.\n\nOn Monday, Shanghai officials said areas without a coronavirus case in the previous 14 days could begin to allow people to leave their compounds. But the messaging was mixed on the ground: Some residents were still instructed to stay put, while others could go out for just an hour.\n\nSome of those who left their homes were disheartened by what they saw.\n\nTam, a 35-year-old in finance, left his apartment compound Tuesday for the first time in 11 days, to find all the stores and businesses around him shut. On the road, he saw several dead cats, street pets that were previously fed by neighbors leaving food out.\n\n“Seeing those starved-to-death animals, I felt depressed,” Tam said, giving only his surname out of privacy concerns.\n\nAcross the city, people are voicing frustration with the local government’s lack of preparation and the departure from targeted controls that once limited disruption to life. On Thursday, two hashtags, one of them unrelated to covid, on the microblog Weibo were flooded with angry posts before they were censored. Critics say the government’s insistence on its zero-covid policy sacrifices ordinary citizens to reinforce the decisions of China’s top leaders.\n\nFor many, the chaos has cost their families too much. Fu Dinghua, 55, watched her mother, suffering from kidney disease, die Monday night after being forced to relocate from a hospital requisitioned for covid patients.\n\nFu said her mother was forced into an ambulance, sandwiched between equipment and luggage, unable to lie down. The next day, she fell unconscious and could not be revived. She would have turned 91 next Thursday.\n\n“I know she didn’t have that long left, but for her to suffer like this, I feel incredible regret,” Fu said.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010810', 'Headline': 'Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19', 'Snippet': 'Despite the fact that we produce enough food to feed everyone on Earth, world hunger is on the rise.

Malnutrition is less about food than about socioeconomic factors such as conflict, poverty, and global disasters such as climate change and the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nutrition and infectious disease exist in an intricate dance. Adequate and balanced nutrition is critical for appropriate response to infection and any changes in the balance can serve as a tipping point for the next pandemic. On the other hand, pandemics, such as COVID-19, lead to greater malnutrition. Both over- and undernutrition increase severity of disease, alter vaccine effectiveness, and potentially create conditions for viral mutation and adaptation—further driving the disease and famine vicious cycle. These long-term health and socioeconomic repercussions have direct effects at individual and global levels and lead to long-term consequences. Therefore, investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, and nutrition programs become vital at a much more complex systems level.\n\nCitation: Hyder S, Chhem RK, Claes F, Karlsson EA (2022) Pestilence and famine: Continuing down the vicious cycle with COVID-19.

Around 536 AD, a volcano erupted—possibly in Iceland—spilling millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere across the Northern Hemisphere [1]. The sun disappeared for 18 months. Crops failed. Millions starved. It also likely sparked the Plague of Justinian (the first documented bubonic or “Black” plague), leading to more famine and devastation. It happened again in the 1300s. A volcanic eruption somewhere in New Zealand led to years of cool, rainy weather preventing crops from ripening in Europe [2]. Waves of respiratory diseases further weakened the population, leading to greater famine. This Great Famine possibly primed an undernourished, weakened population for the Black Death to ravage through Europe in 1346, killing more than a third of the population [3]. In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, causing “the year without summer” and, as a long-term consequence, the Irish Potato Famine of 1845, which led to mass starvation and many death from communicable diseases [4].\n\nAre we detecting commonality here? The historical and biological Butterfly Effect of disease during a famine (or famine during outbreak) is an intricate dance. Infectious disease and malnutrition amplify bidirectionally. Catastrophes such as natural disasters, climate change, war, and economic collapse lead to starvation and infection. Weakened immune systems reduce resistance to further infection, and, ultimately, more malnutrition in a vicious cycle with long-lasting impacts on public health [5].\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic may not directly involve a volcano, history repeats itself. Disease leads to increased poverty, hunger, and changes in socioeconomic behaviors. Thus, insights from past pandemics frame the current COVID-19 hunger crisis and can inform actions to mitigate negative consequences from COVID-19 and future disease outbreaks. One of the most lasting legacies of the pandemic will be increased malnutrition—both undernutrition and obesity (Fig 1). These scars will echo with resounding implications, not only for pandemic recovery, but also for the future of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Several factors should be considered to reflect on the future of nutrition and infectious disease through the lens of COVID-19:\n\nHunger: What doesn’t kill you, just makes you more vulnerable to something else killing you\n\nEvery year, over 5.5 million children die before the age of 5, mostly in Africa and Asia [6]. Half of these children are undernourished. Why? Apart from the necessity of food for sustaining life, nutritional deficiencies decrease immune response, resulting in increased susceptibility, severity, and mortality from diseases. Indeed, about 32% of the global infectious disease burden could be alleviated by eliminating malnutrition [7]. Undernourished children are more susceptible to respiratory infections, diarrhea, measles, and malaria, to name a few [7]. Unfortunately, infection also leads to poor nutrition by causing anorexia and malabsorption and increasing nutrition requirements for immune cells. This leads to even more undernutrition, increasing susceptibility to disease, and moving further down the vicious cycle [8,9].\n\nThe weight of obesity in infectious disease\n\nMalnutrition isn’t just about not having enough food, it’s also about eating too much. Obesity impairs immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens including influenza and COVID-19 [10]. Why? Because your fat also talks to your immune system. Obesity alters adipose tissue signaling, resulting in miscommunication with the immune response and compromising function to deal with infections [11]. Therefore, this interrelationship between adipose tissue, immune response, and infections can exacerbate infection.\n\nYou are what your mother and mother’s mother ate\n\nThere is a direct linkage between maternal malnutrition and the nutritional status of her child. Early malnutrition significantly increases the risk of developing chronic diseases in adults, resulting in a weakened immune response to infectious diseases, and, beyond the age of 2 to 3 years, the effects of chronic malnutrition become almost irreversible [12,13]. Children of women who lived through the Hungry Winter of 1944 to 1945 in the Netherlands and the Chinese Great Famine of 1959 to 1961 faced higher rates of obesity, increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and increased rates of diabetes [12–14]. Even the grandchildren of these women were smaller than average and had a higher chance of becoming obese during adulthood [14]. But we shouldn’t point fingers at moms just yet. The nutritional environment both before conception and throughout gestation influences adult metabolism, but they are just one factor that involved in development.\n\nVaccination efficacy is like a bowl of porridge\n\nWhile opinions on vaccination are undoubtedly mixed, we cannot deny vaccines have greatly improved public health. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979. Polio, measles, and diphtheria are becoming rare. However, vaccine efficacy requires a functional immune system and nutrition is key to bolstering the immune response. Indeed, nutrition is a tipping point on the scales of immunity. Like Goldilocks, effective immunity requires everything to be just right. Too hot or too cold? Things start to break down. Undernutrition has been found to play a role in altering vaccine response for tuberculosis [15], rotavirus [16], measles, and pneumococcus [8]. Obesity also interferes with the ability to mount an effective immune response to vaccination. Obesity also reduces antibody response to hepatitis B and tetanus vaccination. While some associate this reduced response with improper needle length or vaccination technique, it’s also about the antibodies [17]. Compared with healthy-weight adults, vaccinated obese adults are at twice the risk of influenza-like illness or influenza despite equivalent serological response to the influenza vaccination [18].\n\nSometimes, viruses are what you eat\n\nNutritional excess or deficiency both dampen the host immune response and alter cellular metabolism, which creates an advantageous environment for viruses to explore the sequence space and potentially emerge with advantageous mutations [19]. Take obesity. The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports a more diverse viral quasispecies—a mutant cloud of genomes that collectively infect, replicate, and spread among hosts—potentially evolving pathogenic variants capable of inducing greater transmission or disease severity [20]. On the flip side, nutritional deficiencies also change the genetic composition of viruses. In selenium-deficient and vitamin E-deficient mice, genetic mutations arise in coxsackie B and influenza virus populations, and benign strains become more virulent, even to well-nourished hosts [20].\n\nNutrition is critical for immune response and protection from infection. A significant proportion of people in the world are malnourished, a major concern for infectious disease. COVID-19 has increased malnutrition worldwide, creating conditions that may lead to the next pandemic. “People pack” by Dumitriu Robert, “Coronavirus pack” by Graphic Mall, “Coronavirus icon pack” by SkyClick, and “Coronavirus COVID-19 pack” by Eucalyp Studio are all available at http://www.iconfinder.com under a Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). “Phosphor Thin Vol.4 pack” by Phosphor Icons is available at https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/phosphor-thin-vol-4 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010810.g001\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Nutrition and infection in the “New Normal”\n\nBefore the pandemic, the world was already malnourished. Only 2 out of every 5 people on the planet were considered healthy, and many of those probably had a vitamin deficiency [6]. Despite decades of effort, 820 million people in the world still faced hunger shortages and chronic malnutrition at the end of 2019 [21]. Economic slowdowns and downturns already undermined food security [22]. Then along came a pandemic. Lockdowns, supply chain issues, mass job losses, and political crises exacerbated major socioeconomic challenges and furthered food scarcity and inaccessibility. In all, it is estimated that COVID-19 has threatened access to a healthy diet for nearly 2 billion people [21], 6.7 million of those being children under the age of 5 [23].\n\nAlong with hunger, global obesity had nearly tripled since 1975, with almost 40% of adults being overweight in 2016 [24]. During the pandemic, as some were edging closer to wasting and stunting, others were ballooning further into obesity. Pandemic stress, job loss, decreased access to nutritious foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have exacerbated the obesity epidemic [25]. For children in the United States, rate of body mass index increase nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic [26]. As COVID-19 continues to aggravate malnutrition globally, it feeds the vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection with potentially even greater morbidity and mortality down the road. Furthermore, prophylactics for nutritionally compromised populations continue to remain uncharted territory, as a majority of vaccine seroconversion and effectiveness studies are performed on healthy individuals, a minority of the current global population [11].\n\nSo, even before the pandemic ends, we already need to start considering the next. The majority of critically malnourished people reside in global hotspots of emerging and endemic infectious diseases. Pathogens will continue spilling over. The vicious cycle will continue. Investing in and strengthening public health, pandemic prevention, equal access to healthy food, and good nutritional programs is vital. Even combating climate change is critical for agriculture, disease exposure, and, yes, volcanoes. About 1,500 potentially active volcanoes exist around the world. As our planet warms, these volcanoes are projected to become more active and the cooling effects of their eruptions are expected to increase by 15%, massively increasing repercussions. No one wants another worst year to be alive.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank everyone involved in critical discussions and review of this manuscript in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, including Dr. Veasna Duong, and Dr. Jurre Siegers.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Hale ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The elderly crowd had mostly failed to secure supplies through online bulk-purchases, practically the only way to buy anything in Shanghai at the moment, due to their relatively small demand and lack of tech-savviness.\n\nI set out to help but never had I thought online grocery shopping would be such an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nArmed with a membership for a retail warehouse club – presumably allowing me to face less stiff competition than those using a general online grocer – I quickly realized it was impossible to grab one of the coveted delivery slots, which are assigned at 9 p.m. daily, even with food still available on the virtual shelves.\n\nThe retailer’s app simply crashed each night – and would only come back online a few hours later with a glaring “no more delivery slots for the day” message.\n\nAs frustration and anxiety built up, my hope dwindled along with my father’s supply. On Day 2 of my futile attempts, a friend tipped me off about a “boutique” online retailer that was still offering a grocery package with next-day delivery slots. Elated to find out she was right, I immediately ordered for my father.\n\nWhen I broke the good news in the online family group chat, however, uncles and aunts – all facing their own food shortage to various degrees – jumped in to express their shock that I willingly paid 398 yuan ($62) for five kilograms of vegetables and 60 eggs.\n\n“Highway robbery!” cried one uncle, while an aunt stressed the price was more than four times what she would normally pay for the same amount of food in the market.\n\n“But these are boutique eggs,” my dad deadpanned.\n\nI was relieved that my father’s fridge was replenished in time but, hearing relative’s comments, felt a sense of “survivor’s guilt”: What about the countless residents who can’t afford price-gouged groceries?\n\nAn indefinite lockdown\n\nLiteral survival wasn’t a concern for most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents before April.\n\nFor the past two years, the city had bolstered its status as the most important international gateway to China – for both people and goods. It had prided itself on its more targeted and lenient approach to Covid containment, despite Beijing’s strict zero-Covid policy.\n\nWith Shanghai shunning citywide mass testing and adopting less restrictive quarantine rules, it once looked like a potential role model for the whole country as the rest of the world had largely chosen to live with Covid with an emphasis on vaccination.\n\nThen came Omicron, with the highly contagious Covid variant sweeping through the city and infecting more than 390,000 residents since March, according to government statistics.\n\nAfter repeatedly denying the city would be locked down – with police even announcing a probe into alleged online rumormongers – Shanghai authorities abruptly changed course in late March and sealed off the entire metropolis at the beginning of April.\n\nThe government initially billed it as a four-day “temporary pause” – claiming they would promptly test the entire population, isolate positive cases and then re-open the city. As a result, many residents never bothered to stock up.\n\nDespite widespread panic buying before the lockdown, my father was among the unfazed. A retired electric engineer who enjoys travel, photography and coffee, he had recently strained his back muscles – and wasn’t going anywhere in any case.\n\nStill, his home confinement turned out to be much longer – and more precarious – than he ever envisioned.\n\nWith tens of thousands of new infections reported daily, the government has continued to extend the lockdown – ordering any residential community with a single new positive case to be sealed for an additional 14 days.\n\nMy father’s apartment complex is currently slated to be locked down until May 2. But even that date remains uncertain, as the authorities continue to retest residents, meaning the lockdown clock could reset at any time.\n\nFor once, millions of people in Shanghai – young and old, rich and poor, liberal and conservative – seem united by their rising anger.\n\nDespite the censors’ ferocious effort to erase all traces of bad news, social media users keep recounting and re-posting heartbreaking stories, increasingly disgusted by highly choreographed state media images showing an orderly and effective lockdown.\n\nAmong my friends and family, almost everyone has a personal story to share about the lockdown chaos and misery: from sneaking out in darkness to barter some food with a neighbor, to learning harrowing experiences of a friend dumped into to a hastily built isolation ward with leaking roofs and overflowing toilets, and hearing the wailing of an old woman next door whose children were unable to see their newly deceased father one last time.\n\nPropaganda adds insult to injury\n\nPeople are also seeing Chinese propaganda czars double down, painting Omicron as a potentially lethal threat while stressing that only zero-Covid can save China from the deaths and havoc caused by the virus in the West.\n\nOfficials have made it clear the policy has the personal stamp of approval from the country’s strongman leader, Xi Jinping, who has yet to visit Shanghai – a city he once led – amid the deepening crisis. Xi is expected to assume an almost unprecedented third term later this year, paving the way for him to rule for life.\n\nOutside Shanghai, that message still seems to resonate with many, though debates have started to emerge and intensify. Inside the eerily quiet metropolis, the lockdown and its ensuing calamity have become a watershed moment for locals and expatriates.\n\nWith state media headlines screaming “it’s not the flu!” against government statistics showing only about two dozen severe cases among the infected in Shanghai so far, nearly everyone seems to agree on the apparent absurdity of “the solution being worse than the problem” – particularly as stories surface on social media about deaths relating to those unable to receive medical care for non-Covid causes due to the lockdown.\n\nSome residents have questioned online why the authorities appear more keen to attack critics of zero-Covid than to convince residents aged over 60 in the fast-graying city – the most vulnerable group with a disappointing vaccination rate of 62% – to get the shot.\n\nOthers reflect on the current tragedy and contemplate their next steps.\n\n“How did Shanghai fall like this?” has been the line I have heard most often lately. It’s mostly a rhetorical question – the real question seems to be “Shall I stay, or shall I go?”\n\nFor expats, many have been voting with their feet – undaunted by the bureaucratic and logistical hoops they must jump through to just exit their residences.\n\nFor locals, it involves more soul-searching but, echoing sentiment online, a growing number of Shanghainese – native or adopted – have told me they have decided to put their foot down to emigrate.\n\nEntrepreneurs and bankers alike say the brutal lockdown has demonstrated money means nothing in a world where anyone can instantly become collateral damage in plans instigated by a distant and unaccountable leadership.\n\nFor most people in Shanghai, especially of the older generations like my father, they will always call the city home. They remain focused on surviving the ongoing nightmare, trying their luck with bulk-purchasing online.\n\nMy father said someone in his community recently initiated a coffee group-buy attempt – but quickly failed due to lack of interest.\n\n“No one seems to be in the mood for coffee right now,” he said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-search-engines-boost-misinformation/', 'Headline': 'How Search Engines Boost Misinformation | Scientific American', 'Snippet': 'For example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.”', 'Full_text': ""“Do your own research” is a popular tagline among fringe groups and ideological extremists. Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}}",93.33333333333333,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers.

But on FEC forms, the Clinton campaign classified the spending as legal services.\n\n“By intentionally obscuring their payments through Perkins Coie and failing to publicly disclose the true purpose of those payments,” the campaign and DNC “were able to avoid publicly reporting on their statutorily required FEC disclosure forms the fact that they were paying Fusion GPS to perform opposition research on Trump with the intent of influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election,” the initial complaint had read.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and DNC had argued that the payments had been described accurately, but agreed, according to the documents, to settle without conceding to avoid further legal costs.\n\nThe Clinton campaign agreed to a civil penalty of $8,000 and the DNC $105,000, according to a pair of conciliatory agreements that were attached to the letter sent to the Coolidge Reagan Foundation.\n\nThe documents have not yet been made public and FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram said the FEC has 30 days after parties are notified about enforcement matters to release them.\n\nThe Steele dossier was a report compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and financed by Democrats that included salacious allegations about Trump’s conduct in Russia and allegations about ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nDocuments have shown the FBI invested significant resources attempting to corroborate the dossier and relied substantially on it to obtain surveillance warrants targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nBut the dossier has been largely discredited since its publication, with core aspects of the material exposed as unsupported and unproven rumors. A special counsel assigned to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe charged one of Steele’s sources with lying to the FBI and charged a cybersecurity lawyer who worked for Clinton’s campaign with lying to the FBI during a 2016 meeting in which he relayed concerns about the Russia-based Alfa Bank.\n\nTrump, who has railed against the dossier for years, released a statement celebrating the agreement and once again slamming the dossier as “a Hoax funded by the DNC and the Clinton Campaign.”\n\nA DNC spokesperson played down the decision, saying: “We settled aging and silly complaints from the 2016 election about ‘purpose descriptions’ in our FEC report.” The lawyer representing both the campaign and the DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe letter was first reported by the Washington Examiner.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump-sues-hillary-clinton-others-over-russian-collusion-allegations-2022-03-24/', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over 2016 Russian collusion ...', 'Snippet': 'REUTERS/Octavio Jones/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights.

Any way we can track down who this guy is and how we’re getting this information?”\n\nSupervisory Special Agent Daniel Wierzbicki followed up: “An interview with the source of information … may allow us to understand the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the white paper.”\n\nGaynor responded that it was being discussed at headquarters, but did not provide the identity of the source.\n\nOn Monday, he said he might have come to a different conclusion about the hold hindering the investigation if he had known Sussmann was acting as an attorney for the Clinton campaign when he turned over the information.\n\nAccording to Gaynor, that knowledge could have “impacted the way I viewed the close hold” and that it would have been more of “an issue on the close hold on the hinder side.”\n\nGaynor added that had he known the source was motivated by politics or someone with a business interest that overlapped with the bureau, he might not have ever volunteered to act as a point person at agency headquarters.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Bosworth repeatedly tried to poke holes in Gaynor’s previous statements to investigators, highlighting a number of instances in which the agent testified that he knew Sussmann was acting on behalf of the Democratic National Committee — even conflating the attorney and the DNC as the source of the information in his testimony before a grand jury.\n\nSussmann is charged with lying to the FBI when he met with Baker in September 2016 and turned over a “white paper” that showed the purported tie between the Trump Organization and Alfa-Bank.\n\nSussmann said he was providing the information on his own when, according to prosecutors, he was working on behalf of the Clinton campaign and another client, tech executive Rodney Joffe, who told him about the bank.'}}",88.85714285714286,1

During the course of his testimony, Trump frequently took the opportunity to offer his own opinions about the case.\n\nTrump’s Monday appearance before the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan marks his second time in the witness box during the proceedings being overseen by Justice Arthur Engoron. In late October, Trump was asked to testify about prior comments he made on social media about the judge’s law clerk. After offering an excuse, Engoron found the witness “not credible” and warned him not to make such comments again.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the 45th president’s first foray into giving under-oath answers actually germane to the long-running lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\n1. The judge offered himself as a punching bag\n\nKevin Wallace led the questioning for the attorney general’s office and early on gave Trump a lot of leeway to elaborate on his answers. But that leeway quickly led to a judicial upbraiding.\n\nAfter one question, Trump downplayed the importance banks paid to his financial statements, saying bankers were typically more interested in securing the overall deals with the Trump Organization.\n\n“They just weren’t a very important element in a bank’s decision-making process, and we’ll explain this as this very crazy trial goes along,” the witness said, according to a courtroom report by MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nIn response to the characterization of the trial, Engoron told Trump not to give speeches during his answers. In response to that, Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise complained that the questions were open-ended and arguably called for a narrative response.\n\nAfter moving on to one of the specific contested financial statements, Trump acknowledged the document in question assigns responsibility for its accuracy to himself – but said if there were any issues, they would have or should have been caught by his accounting firm. Asked further to explain what, if anything, he personally did to ensure the accuracy of such documents in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Trump began to speechify again.\n\nRemarking that the financial statements were signed off on too long ago for him to remember, the witness complained that the vintage of those forms also brings them well outside the statute of limitations. Then, he criticized the judge directly, saying: “I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me,” according to a courtroom report by The Messenger’s Adam Klasfeld.\n\nIn response, Engoron said it was not true that he always rules against Trump, asked Kise if the criticism was necessary, and then spoke to Trump directly: “You can attack me – you can do whatever you want. But please just answer the questions.”\n\n2. The witness concedes the valuations were off\n\nThe crux of the matter before the court are inflated valuations of properties owned by Trump and the Trump Organization. In late September, buoyed by thousands of pages of exhibits filed by the attorney general’s office, Engoron determined that many financial statements filed by Trump and his family’s business empire were fraudulent – deciding a motion of summary judgment in the state’s favor.\n\nSeveral ancillary issues, however, remain – including the amount of the disgorgement, or fine, that the Trump Organization must pay – along with various other potential penalties. And, key to many of the extant legal issues left for the court to determine is the intent and culpability of other named defendants. In other words, the judge is currently assessing who, exactly, was responsible for the fraud – and, the extent to which that fraud was willingly committed in violation of New York State law governing for-profit organizations.\n\nTrump, for his part, conceded that several valuations were incorrect – in both directions – but insisted those weren’t material to the deals he was making and, in any event, couldn’t be considered fraud.\n\n“Do you remember thinking some of those valuations were off?” Wallace asked the witness.\n\nIn response, he said, Mar-a-Lago was “very underestimated.” He added that he personally felt his properties on 40 Wall Street and a golf course in Miami were also undervalued but didn’t raise an issue with how those values were reflected on the documents because he “didn’t care.”\n\nTrump also replied that in his opinion, an apartment in the Trump Tower in Manhattan was overvalued, but that it only takes one person to pay the asking price and buy it for the value to be valid.\n\n“I think I was certainly more expert than anyone else, so if somebody would ask me or if I had an opinion, I would give it,” he reportedly said.\n\n3. The judge snapped at Trump and his attorneys – and Trump’s attorneys snapped back\n\nAs for opinions, Trump had a lot to share on the stand – eventually annoying the court by giving longwinded answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nIn response to one question, Trump gave a sarcastic caricature of the attorney general’s case against him. That answer was stricken.\n\nJudge Engoron then recommended: “Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally…Maybe you should have a talk with him right now.”\n\nEventually, Kise threw up his hands and replied: “You’re in control of the courtroom, not me.”\n\nWhile giving another opinion about his own business acumen, Trump ran over questioning by Wallace and continued to boast about his property management techniques at one Fifth Avenue location in particular. That didn’t sit well with Engoron. The judge attempted to interject by saying “excuse me.” Trump then told the judge to “hold on” and continued discussing his capitalistic savvy.\n\nFinally, the judge had enough.\n\nAddressing Kise, Engoron instructed the defense attorney to “control your witness” and threatened to dismiss Trump from the stand and, instead, “draw every negative inference” from his absence.\n\n“I beseech you to control him,” the judge added.\n\nKise urged the court against such a course of action.\n\n“I’d urge the court to take in all information possible,” Trump’s attorney reportedly replied. “You have on the stand a candidate for president of the United States; the most efficient way to get through this is to listen to what he has to say…about what happened and why there’s no intent to mislead anyone. I believe that’s highly relevant and highly probative.”\n\nAnother Trump attorney, Alina Habba, then spoke up, somewhat more aggressively defending her client, advising the judge that if the state wants better responses from the witness, they shouldn’t ask open-ended questions.\n\n“We are not here to hear what he has to say,” Engoron explained. “We are here to listen to him answer questions.”\n\nHabba took direct issue with that, telling the judge: “Yes, you are here to listen to what he has to say.”\n\nIn response, the judge shouted at Habba and told her to sit down – before telling the state to proceed with questioning the witness.\n\n4. Trump complained about the judge’s work – and then posted about it\n\n“This is a very unfair trial,” the witness said after his lawyer was shouted down by the court. “Very, very unfair, and I hope the public is watching it.”\n\nAnd, during a recess, Trump made sure to highlight the blowup between Habba and Engoron.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, a conservative social media outlet owned by the former president, Trump posted a meme containing an image of the judge and his remark about not wanting to hear what Trump “has to say.”\n\nTrump, of course, has also been a voluble critic of James and her office. During his testimony, he opined that the attorney general was essentially targeting him in order to make a name for herself. In the process of this criticism, he suggested she had little personal knowledge of the ins and outs of New York real estate by questioning her basic grasp of geography.\n\n“She doesn’t know what 40 Wall Street is worth,” Trump said. “She doesn’t even know where 40 Wall Street is.”\n\nDuring the lunch recess, James made her own social media post in response to the courtroom antics in lower Manhattan on Monday.\n\n5. Trump wags his finger and highlights his wealth\n\nA constant theme throughout the testimony provided by the ex-president and current presidential candidate on Monday was the idea that he was being targeted for political reasons.\n\nIn support of this argument, Trump repeatedly stressed the end results of what happened between banks and the Trump Organization: everybody made money.\n\nBanks who lent Trump’s business money “got all their money back” and loans were always “paid off in full,” he testified.\n\n“There was no loss of money,” the witness reportedly said during questioning after the lunchtime recess. “They made a lot of money, and everyone is trying to figure out why you’re doing it…I understand it. It’s called ‘politics.'”\n\nLaunching into another speech-in-miniature, Trump called Wallace and the state’s case against him “a disgrace” and continued to muse about the political origins of the attorney general’s complaint.\n\n“It’s election interference because you want to keep me in this courthouse all day long,” he reportedly complained.\n\nProsecutors argue that the fraudulent documents were material, however, because the figures included in them often resulted in Trump receiving favorable interest rates on the loans.\n\n“Everybody got their money in full, and now you’re assuming the statements are phony,” Trump said earlier on.\n\nIf anything, Trump testified, the statements of financial condition likely underestimated “how rich” the Trump Organization really was when they were filed\n\n“I became president because of my brand,” Trump reportedly said. “If I wanted to build up a statement because of my brand, all I would have to do is add brand value and my financial statement would be very very substantial.”\n\nLater on, Wallace repeatedly pressed the witness on various loan agreements that required him to provide “true and correct” financial statements – focusing on language that necessitated certain high-threshold cash reserves.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Trump reportedly said in response. “So I don’t know what you’re getting at.”\n\nAsked point blank, however, whether the financial statements inflated his assets, the witness returned to a favored defense. Trump argued that so-called “worthless clause” disclaimers – clauses that advise caution in interpreting financial data – render any financial misstatements less significant than the state is making them out to be.\n\nSuch disclaimers, the witness said, “go on forever.”\n\nPerhaps feeling left out from all of the prior drama, the state’s attorney then got in a rare zinger of his own.\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” Wallace reportedly deadpanned.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.courthousenews.com/final-witness-delivers-blistering-testimony-against-trump-in-civil-fraud-case/', 'Headline': 'Final witness delivers blistering testimony against Trump in civil ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump, center, arrives at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, in New York.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/trump-civil-fraud-trial-witness-list-new-york/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump and his adult children are listed as potential witnesses ...', 'Snippet': 'The former president is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York attorney general and Trump’s legal team.

Attorneys for both sides need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled earlier this week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are both defendants in the case, and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in videotaped depositions.\n\nIn civil cases, defendants can be called to testify and if they refuse, the jury, or in this case Judge Arthur Engoron, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nThe case is scheduled to start Monday. Engoron will decide how much money the Trumps would pay the state after finding the former president and his business engaged in a persistent fraud by using inflated financial statements for nearly a decade.\n\nThe state is also seeking to prove the Trumps engaged in insurance fraud and falsified business records.

But I was told to sit down today, I was yelled at,"" Habba said.\n\nHabba also criticized James, saying that she was using the trial to ""make a name for herself.""\n\n""[James] said this morning that the numbers don\'t lie and they won\'t lie in this case. Well, Miss James, I have a message for you: The numbers didn\'t lie when you ran for governor, and that\'s why you dropped out,"" Habba said.\n\nDuring the break, Trump also quoted Engoron\'s remark without context in a post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court after having left office — Teddy Roosevelt did so twice.\n\nIn 1913, the 26th president was a plaintiff in a civil suit against a Michigan newspaper that had accused him of being a drunk. The second was a civil case in which Roosevelt was sued by a New York Republican Party boss he’d accused of being corrupt. Roosevelt won both cases.\n\nNBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg breaks down Trump’s possible motives for sparring with Engoron while testifying in his civil fraud trial.\n\nThe court has left for a lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court adjourned at about 12:50 p.m. ET for lunch. The proceedings are expected to resume again at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom with a team of aides and his lawyers, quickly passing reporters in the hallway again with no comment, but flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nJames also passed by reporters in the hallway but did not comment.\n\nTrump interrupts questioning to read from a document he pulled from his pocket\n\nMinutes ago, Trump pulled a paper out of his pocket, saying he wanted to read it. But the attorney general\'s lawyer pivoted to another question, and Trump rested the document to his right on the witness stand.\n\nTrump then interrupted the lawyer, saying he just wanted to read the document, and turned to the judge for an answer.\n\nEngoron told him no.\n\n“I am shocked,” Trump said.\n\nIt\'s unclear what the document is.\n\nTrump trains his ire on Engoron\n\nand\n\nLosing his composure, Trump then focused his ire on the judge, saying Engoron ruled against him before knowing anything about his company.\n\nTrump said the judge called him a ""fraud,"" raising his voice and pointing his right hand at the judge while looking straight ahead at the courtroom. He then said any fraud was on the part of the judge for his comments on the value of Trump\'s properties, not on Trump, calling it ""a terrible thing.""\n\nEngoron just looked forward, sour-faced.\n\n""Done?"" Wallace asked when Trump ended his outburst.\n\n“Done,” the former president said.\n\nTrump has essentially brought his rants inside the courtroom. Before, he would be well mannered during his appearances here; it was outside where he lost his cool. Now he\'s losing it on the witness stand.\n\nTrump defiantly asserts his wealth, calls James a \'hack\'\n\nand\n\nAs Trump was asked questions about additional properties, the former president said he is worth billions of dollars more than Attorney General Letitia James has said.\n\nPeople don\'t recognize the strength of the company he built because James\' office is trying to ""demean"" and ""hurt"" him, Trump claimed.\n\n“I think she is a political hack,” he said about the attorney general.\n\nHe repeated a common refrain of his online, calling the trial a political witch hunt and saying James should be ashamed of herself.\n\nWhile testifying in his New York civil fraud trial, Trump sparred with Engoron about his business dealings and claimed the trial was politically motivated. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard reports on what Trump said under oath so far.\n\nTrump appears restless during testimony\n\nand\n\nAs he testifies, Trump is leaning way back in his chair and has his arms crossed on his chest. He also appears a bit restless, slightly swaying his body back and forth.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, when Wallace would ask him to refer to pages of documents before him, Trump would only look at a screen provided in the courthouse, unlike a typical witness who would refer to the pages in his or her hands.\n\nTrump says he thought several valuations were \'too high\'\n\nand\n\nAs questioning continued about Trump\'s properties, the former president said he thought several valuations were ""too high,"" including of his Trump Tower triplex in 2014.\n\nAsked why the valuation was too high, Trump said a broker assessed the total area as 30,000 square feet, ""and I have access to the roof, and when you add the roof, you’re not that far off.” He said, ""I see how it was done,"" telling the court that ""they took 10,000 per floor"" and ""times three"" and didn’t take out the elevator shaft and other things.\n\nHe added, “There\'s a disclaimer clause, so if there is a mistake ... you don\'t get sued by the attorney general\'s office.”\n\nIn his earlier deposition, Trump referred to a disclaimer clause in the company\'s financial statements ""that says, don’t believe the statement, go out and do your own work. This statement is \'worthless.\' It means nothing.""\n\nBut in his late-September ruling ahead of the trial, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nEngoron cuts off Trump and prosecutor repeats questions\n\nand\n\nShortly after Trump resumed testimony, Engoron cut off the former president after Trump started to go on after answering a question about the value of an Avenue of the Americas property.\n\nAt another point, Trump veered into his focusing on China, Russia, and keeping the U.S. safe while president, the attorney general\'s lawyer said, “The question was actually about this property value.”\n\n""The question was"" and ""let me ask again"" are becoming familiar refrains as Trump doesn\'t answer the questions.\n\nTrump has returned to the courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump walked back into the courtroom at about 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\nHe turned to reporters in the hallway and gave a silent thumbs-up before following his lawyers through the courtroom doors.\n\nThe judge also entered the courtroom and everyone stood.\n\nWhen he resumed testimony, Trump began answering questions more succinctly.\n\nTrump leaves for a break without addressing reporters\n\nTrump exited the courtroom for a 15-minute break, walking quickly past reporters in the hallway.\n\nWhen asked, ""How\'s it going in there?"" Trump gestured as if zipping his lips and continued to walk away with his lawyers.\n\nBreak called; Trump leaves stand\n\nThe court is taking a break. Trump has left the witness stand.\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyers: \'I beseech you to control him\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe judge is again asking Trump\'s lawyers to have him answer questions directly while on the stand.\n\n""That was a simple yes-no answer,"" the judge said. ""I beseech you to control him.""\n\nThe judge went back and forth with Kise, with the judge saying, ""I don\'t want to hear everything he has to say.""\n\nHabba then told the judge that Wallace needs to ask better questions, saying, ""More succinct questions will give more succinct answers.""\n\n""We are not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron responded. ""We are here to have him answer questions.""\n\n""It\'s not that simple,"" Habba replied.\n\n""I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!"" Engoron then said, raising his voice.\n\nThe testy exchange prompted Trump to comment, ""This is a very unfair trial. I hope the public is watching.""\n\nThe judge\'s warnings are critical, as the case here is only meant to determine monetary damages. If Engoron determines that all of Trump\'s testimony is not credible, as he did the last time Trump took the stand, he may impose significant financial damages on Trump and his company.\n\nAttorney in hush money case audibly laughs\n\nand\n\nAs Trump continued to testify, one of his attorneys in the separate hush money case being brought by the Manhattan district attorney could be heard laughing in the second row of the courtroom as she observed and took notes.\n\nTrump says he thought Mar-a-Lago\'s value was underestimated\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhen asked about Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he thought its value was underestimated, but added that he didn\'t do anything about it.\n\nTrump referred to the attorney general\'s estimation that the Florida property was worth far less than he claimed (the AG’s office had noted the Palm Beach County assessor appraised its market value to be $18 million to $28 million from 2011 to 2021, while Trump’s balance sheet put its value at $426 million to $612 million).\n\nTrump claimed on the stand that the property was 50 to 100 times the state\'s estimation. He said he doesn\'t know how the lower estimation was arrived at, calling it ""absolutely crazy.""\n\nTrump says he thought his apartment was \'overvalued\'\n\nand\n\nTrump testified that he thought his Manhattan apartment ""was overvalued when I looked at it.""\n\n""But you never know because people come along and could say it\'s worth $250 million. It only takes one person to buy it,"" he said. ""I thought it was high and it is the brand value.""\n\n""The brand value is a very big part of the asset value of the company,"" he added. ""I could have added brand value and increased the value, and my financial statement would be very substantial.""\n\nEngoron asks Trump lawyers to control him\n\nJudge Engoron asked Trump\'s attorneys if they could control him in the courtroom. He said, ""This is not a political rally … maybe you need to have a talk with him right now.""\n\nKise calls Trump the \'future\' U.S. president, citing New York Times/Siena poll\n\nand\n\nDuring questioning, Trump attorney Chris Kise referred to his client as the future president of the United States, citing a poll released yesterday by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with Siena College, found that Trump is leading Biden in five out of six battleground states.\n\nTrump distances himself from his financial statements\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAsked about the exaggerated financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said that he knew little about them, and that banks didn\'t care about them.\n\n“All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary to supply the accountants for the statements,"" he said. ""I authorized whatever they needed to do to get their statement done.”\n\nAs for the bankers that the AG maintains were duped into giving him more favorable loans than he was entitled to, Trump said, ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump says judge will rule against him\n\nand\n\n“What did you do to meet your responsibility of preparation of the financial statement,” James’ office asked.\n\nTrump said: “Me personally? First of all this was so long ago this is past statute of limitations.”\n\nTrump then insisted that Engoron will “rule against me because he will always rule against me.”\n\nEngoron pushed back, saying that Trump’s claim isn’t true, and asked him to please answer the question again: “You can attack me all you want, but just answer the question.”\n\nJudge tells Trump to be more \'responsive\'\n\nAt one point as Trump started to testify, Engoron asked him to ""please move it along and answer the questions.""\n\n""Some of the questions haven\'t been responsive,"" the judge added.\n\nTrump looked ahead as the judge said this, never turning toward him.\n\nTrump claims bankers didn’t pay attention to the financial statements\n\nand\n\nTrump said his team will bring in bankers who ""paid little attention"" to financial documents.\n\n“This crazy trial goes along. We will bring in bankers. They will explain what the process is,"" he said. ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump rails against AG and prosecutors, calling them \'all haters\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the AG\'s office, asked Trump about the appointment and acceptance of trustees, and in response, he said, ""You and every other Democrat … coming after me from 15 different sides … all haters.""\n\nHe was referring to the New York attorney general and U.S. attorneys.\n\nTrump has been sworn in\n\nTrump has been sworn in inside the courtroom, kicking off his testimony.\n\nTrump has taken the stand\n\nThe former president is now in the witness stand, where he will be questioned by prosecutors.\n\nTrump and Engoron enter courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom and is seated at the defense table with his hands clasped together.\n\nHe\'s been chatting with his lawyers, Chris Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has entered the courtroom.\n\nIt will be a tale of two Donalds on Monday: The one inside court, who has generally maintained his composure aside from a few facial expressions and a waving of the arms, and the one outside, who goes off on Engoron and his law clerk and a legal system that he claims is arrayed against him and his family.\n\nJames arrives at courthouse, says numbers \'don\'t lie\'\n\nJames arrived at the courthouse and told reporters outside that the facts and the numbers don\'t lie.\n\n""Trump has repeatedly and consistently misrepresented the value of his assets,"" she said. ""I’m certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting and call this a witch hunt. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friends, don’t lie.""\n\nOnce inside, James greeted the prosecutors in a show of support, shaking hands with the visitors sitting in the front row.\n\nWhat to expect from Trump\'s testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to take the witness stand in a New York courtroom Monday, testifying in a high-stakes civil case that could lead to the dismantling of his sprawling business empire.\n\nHe was deposed in April after James filed her bombshell suit alleging that he and his company inflated their assets to the tune of billions of dollars to get more favorable rates from banks and insurers, and his answers there are likely to be a guidepost about how he’ll be questioned Monday.\n\nTrump spent about seven hours in the deposition answering questions from the attorney general’s office and disavowing responsibility for the annual statements of financial condition, which say “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump testified that he considered the financial statements as being “worthless” and not “important” because they contained a clause that said, “the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon the disposition of the assets or payment of the related liabilities.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump referred to that as a “clause in there that says, don’t believe the statement, go and do your own work. The statement is worthless. It means nothing.”\n\nIn his Oct. 2 ruling, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe courtroom is at full capacity ahead of Trump\'s testimony\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe courtroom has reached full capacity in anticipation of Trump\'s testimony today.\n\nThe line to get into the courtroom is still long and the number of photographers in the hallway is the highest it has been since the beginning of the trial. Some friends of the judge and his clerk are seated in the front row excited to witness history.\n\nEngoron has expanded a gag order to include members of the former president\'s legal team. The order was issued after the judge claimed they made “inappropriate remarks” about his law clerk.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are outside the courthouse\n\nand\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters gathered outside the courthouse this morning, holding a banner that reads, ""Invoke the 14th.""\n\nThe protesters advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump to block him from the ballot in his 2024 presidential run briefly stopped traffic along Centre Street. Police moved them across the street into Foley Square and traffic has since resumed.\n\nTrump leaves for the courthouse\n\nTrump\'s motorcade has departed from Trump Tower and is en route to the courthouse.\n\nTrump lashes out at Engoron and James ahead of testimony\n\nAhead of his highly anticipated testimony today, Trump took aim at Engoron and James in a post on Truth Social this morning, despite Engoron\'s gag order barring the former president and his lawyers from discussing the judge’s staff.\n\nIn his post, Trump denied wrongdoing as he repeated his claims that the trial is a political hit job against him orchestrated by Engoron and James.\n\n""Got a really Biased, Nasty, Club controlled, but often overturned, Judge, a Racist, Evil, and Corrupt Attorney General, BUT A CASE THAT, ACCORDING TO ALMOST ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS, HAS ZERO MERIT,"" he wrote. ""A dark day for our Country. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nTrump testified in the trial briefly — and then stormed out of court\n\nTrump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nTrump’s abrupt departure appeared to surprise even his own lawyers and his Secret Service agents, who went scurrying after him. He returned to the courtroom in Manhattan after the court day ended and after Cohen finished his contentious testimony.\n\nEngoron handed down the financial penalty after having called Trump to testify under oath in the afternoon about whom he was talking about when he told reporters earlier in the day that the person sitting next to the judge was “very partisan.”\n\nTrump said he was referring to Cohen, whom he has called a rat, a liar and a felon. Engoron said he found Trump’s brief testimony “not credible.” He fined Trump for violating the gag order he issued this month after Trump had smeared his law clerk on social media.\n\nA red-faced and angry-looking Trump stormed out of the courtroom about 45 minutes later after Engoron denied a motion from his lawyers on a separate legal issue.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHighlights from Eric Trump and Don Jr.\'s testimony last week\n\nDuring his testimony last week, Eric largely asserted that he lacked knowledge of the details of Trump Organization property appraisals and financial statements. The former president’s second-oldest son described himself as a “construction guy,” saying, “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals.”\n\nAt one point, however, he did acknowledge an awareness of his father’s financial statements dating as far back as 2013.\n\nTrump\'s eldest son, Don Jr., the first of the two to take the stand, said during his testimony that he didn’t recall the details of several documents shown to him in court. He added that he relied on the Trump Organization’s accountants and accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise, meanwhile, continued Friday to complain about the judge, pointing to stories in right-wing news outlets alleging Engoron and his clerk have made political donations to Democrats. Kise pointed to a story that alleged the clerk made donations in excess of legal limits for court staff in violation of court rules, and that the judge was notified and did nothing about it, which Kise said could be grounds for a mistrial if true.\n\nEngoron called the allegations untrue, adding, ""It\'s a shame we have descended to this level.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211133180/trump-spars-with-new-york-judge-as-he-testifies-in-civil-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial - NPR', 'Snippet': 'Trump spars with New York judge as he testifies in civil fraud trial Things got testy Monday when former President Donald Trump took the witness stand in his civil fraud trial in New York. Trump ...', 'Full_text': 'MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the witness stand yesterday at a New York courthouse. He was there to answer questions related to fraudulent financial statements made by the Trump Organization, statements that were used to secure business and credit deals with banks and also to measure Trump\'s net worth. New York\'s attorney general is accusing Trump, along with several associates, of knowingly committing fraud by inflating the value of these assets. NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo was in the courthouse, and she\'s with us now to tell us what she saw. Good morning.\n\nXIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: Ximena, we keep hearing how it got pretty testy in there. What can you tell us about that?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, it didn\'t take long for the pair to clash. This is not the first time that they met face to face. Trump has come to multiple days of this trial, even though he\'s not required to. And don\'t forget that he was called up to the witness stand once before by Judge Arthur Engoron himself to answer questions about comments he made that violated a gag order. Now, yesterday during the first hour, there were some tense exchanges between the judge and Trump\'s legal team, Engoron at one point beseeching the Trump team to, quote, ""control him."" And that was his word, beseeching.\n\nAnd he felt Trump was going on long speeches, and some that included tangents about his properties and political success or how he thought the judge was politically motivated. Engoron seemed to have no patience for this and even went as far as to remind Trump that this is not a political rally. Still, though, Trump called the state attorney general a political hack and doubled down on many of the personal insults that he\'s been leaning on since the start of this trial. Trump\'s team also argued that the nature of this case, being that Trump is a frontrunner for the GOP nomination and there is no jury, should warrant longer answers than perhaps the judge wants.\n\nMARTIN: Speaking of those facts, let\'s just recap those briefly. New York Attorney General Letitia James says Trump was part of an effort to inflate and sometimes deflate the value of Trump Organization assets to get better deals. Trump and his co-defendants have actually already been found liable for fraud, so this trial will decide the potential punishment. James wants them banned from doing business in the state and $250 million in penalties. So what further arguments has the prosecution made?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, the attorney general\'s team has brought up various witnesses who worked within the Trump Organization and the accounting firm Mazars to generally ask about how these documents were created. And this includes the literal math - we\'ve been staring at a ton of spreadsheets - but also the hierarchy and power influence that higher-ranking Trump Organization executives, such as Donald Trump, may have had.\n\nUltimately, the executives of the Trump Organization, including Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., signed off on these statements that have already been found to be fraudulent and may have been responsible for them, even if they didn\'t do the number crunching themselves. Still, though, some witnesses have testified that Trump did want the numbers to be higher for certain perks, like landing on the Forbes Top 100 list.\n\nMARTIN: So we heard two of the president\'s sons, Eric and Don Jr., testify last week. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, is due to take the witness stand tomorrow. What can we expect to hear from her?\n\nBUSTILLO: Well, Ivanka is the last witness that the attorney general\'s team is putting forward. And unlike her brothers, she is not a defendant. Her attorney successfully argued that any related actions Ivanka had at the Trump Organization happened before the statute of limitations kicked in. But the attorney general\'s team plans to rest their case after that, and then the Trump team will begin to lay out their case the following week.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR\'s Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.\n\nBUSTILLO: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF L\'ECLAIR\'S ""TAISHI-KOTO, PT. 1"")\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

And he sought to tie them to special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictments, even though they are unconnected.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said before walking into the courtroom. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nAttorney general asks to ban Trump from doing business in New York: Kevin Wallace, with the attorney general’s office, alleged that Trump and his co-defendants conspired to commit persistent and repeated fraud and that Trump’s financial statements convinced banks to take on hidden risk “to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nThe opening statement underscored the risk the case poses to Trump and the Trump Organization, the former president’s business in New York, where Trump built up his name and image before he launched the political campaign that led him to the White House in 2016.\n\nTrump’s lawyers say this is how real estate works: With the former president looking on, Trump’s lawyers argued Monday that the attorney general’s case was flawed, saying that the differences in valuations were just part of the commercial real estate business.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Christopher Kise, argued there was no intent to defraud and “no victims” in the case.\n\nKise pointed to documents from Deutsche Bank showing the bank valued Trump’s net worth $2 billion less than Trump did — but still underwrote the loan for Trump.\n\nJudge spars with Trump attorneys: The judge noted that the defense team already had tried to dismiss the case by claiming James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump. He had already denied the motion, Engoron said, and his ruling had been affirmed by a New York appellate court.\n\nThe judge also sparred with Trump attorney Alina Habba over a discussion about an accounting disclaimer for Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm. The disclaimer essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nThe exchanges underscored how the upcoming trial is going to be contested — especially when the judge, and not a jury, will decide the outcome.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nFact check: Trump’s inaccurate comments about a ""worthless clause""\n\nIn comments to reporters before the Monday hearing, Trump spoke at length about what he called a “worthless clause” disclaimer in the financial statements that are at issue in the trial.\n\nTrump said, “We have a clause in the contract, it’s like a buyer beware clause. It says, ‘When you take a look at the financial statement, don’t believe anything you read’ — this is up front. ‘Don’t believe anything you read.’ Some people call it a ‘worthless clause,’ because it makes the statement, and anything you read in the statement, worthless. It says, ‘Go out and do your own research, go out and do your own due diligence, you have to study the statement carefully. Do not believe anything.’”\n\nHe said moments later that the clause “immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation.”\n\nFacts First: Trump inaccurately described this clause, as Judge Arthur Engoron noted in a ruling last week in which he found Trump liable for fraud. The clause does not say “don’t believe anything you read,” its actual language is significantly softer than Trump claimed. And there is no apparent basis for Trump’s suggestion that the clause inoculates him against any litigation at all.\n\nEngoron wrote last week that “the ‘worthless clause’ does not say what defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud as to facts peculiarly within defendants’ knowledge, even vis-à-vis sophisticated recipients.”\n\nHe also wrote that “a defendant may not rely on a disclaimer for misrepresentation of facts peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge” — and that “defendants’ reliance on these ‘worthless’ disclaimers is worthless.”\n\nHere’s the text of the clause:\n\nThere is certainly language in the clause that suggests that readers of the financial statements should use caution in relying on the listed asset valuations. But the clause doesn’t say the valuations are entirely worthless and does not tell readers that they should simply not believe anything they read in the statements. Rather, it suggests there had been a good-faith effort to value the assets using a variety of reasonable methods.\n\n“You can read it up and down; it doesn’t say, ‘I will lie to you, I will double or triple the value of these things — my statements in here are outright lies,’” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said last week.\n\nJudge asks whether testimony about 2011 documents was a ""waste of time""\n\nThe judge in former President Donald Trump’s civil trial Monday questioned whether lengthy witness testimony about 2011 financial documents was a “waste of time” because of statute of limitations applying to the case expired in 2014.\n\nAt the end of Monday’s court session, Judge Arthur Engoron responded to testimony from former Mazars account Donald Bender about the 2011 financial documents, acknowledging that a state appellate court had ruled the statute of limitations only allowed allegations from 2014 onward to apply in the case.\n\nThe defense agreed with Engoron’s assertion, prompting Trump to give a thumbs up.\n\nThe judge’s comment marked a small win for Trump because it showed the judge again recognizing the statute of limitations that had been decided by the appeals court.\n\nAt the same time, however, Engoron did allow the witness testimony about the 2011 financial documents on Monday over the objection of Trump’s attorneys, as the attorney general’s office indicated it would connect the testimony to allegations that fall within the statute of limitations.\n\nBender is returning for a second day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nIn his ruling last week, Engoron wrote that the fraudulent statements of financial condition were still relevant in the case even if they’re for transactions completed before 2014 because they were submitted within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge wrote that the attorney general’s office was not “challenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,” but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information.\n\nMonday’s comments addressing admissible evidence do not indicate that Engoron will change that ruling.\n\nTrump\'s motorcade returns to Trump Tower after he attended first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has returned to Trump Tower after spending the day attending his civil fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until December 22, according to Judge Arthur Engoron.\n\nAsked if he would return to court on Tuesday, Trump told reporters while leaving court for the day: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nCivil fraud trial “took me off the campaign trail,"" Trump claims\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that Monday’s civil fraud trial in New York took him “off the campaign trail” and cast the trial as a political attack against him.\n\nTrump was not required to attend the trial, which is a civil action — not a criminal case.\n\nDespite that the former president attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James’ $250 million lawsuit against him in the same manner that he has railed against the criminal charges he’s facing in four other jurisdictions.\n\nAsked whether he was returning for the trial on Tuesday, Trump said: “We may, I’d love not to. I’d love to be campaigning instead of doing this.”\n\nFact check: Trump baselessly claims federal Justice Department is behind New York civil fraud trial\n\nIn comments to reporters before Monday’s hearing, former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that the federal Justice Department orchestrated the New York state civil fraud case and other cases against him.\n\n“It all comes down from the DOJ. They totally coordinate this in Washington,” Trump said. He added later in his remarks, “It’s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington. Everything goes through them.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Justice Department directed anyone to bring this state civil fraud case. The trial that began Monday stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who quickly began investigating Trump’s company upon being sworn in at the beginning of 2019 – when Trump still had two full years left in his presidency. Trump has correctly noted that James, a Democrat, herself ran on a campaign platform that included a vow to take on Trump.\n\nTrump also said in his Monday comments that “this trial could’ve been brought years ago, but they waited ‘til I was right in the middle of my campaign; the same with other trials and indictments.”\n\nIt’s true that a previous New York attorney general could conceivably have pursued the same case years ago, since the allegations pertain to conduct dating back more than a decade — but James brought the case in September 2022, roughly two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022.\n\nTrump faces two federal criminal cases that were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland; it’s fair to argue that the Justice Department is behind those cases.\n\nBut Trump has also baselessly alleged that the Justice Department is responsible for two criminal cases brought against him by local district attorneys in Manhattan, New York, and Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump says he attended the civil trial because he wanted ""to watch this witch hunt"" himself\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he attended the civil fraud trial against him that began Monday in New York so he could “watch this witch hunt myself.”\n\nTrump was not required to appear in court Monday for the trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives. But he chose to attend and sit in the Manhattan courtroom – while giving multiple statements attacking the proceedings as he entered and exited.\n\nHe continued to rail against Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil trial, saying he should be disbarred after he ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case.\n\nTrump criticizes judge overseeing civil fraud case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attacked Arthur Engoron, the judge overseeing his civil case, as he left the courtroom during a lunch break following opening statements this morning.\n\nTrump called Engoron a Democrat and “an operative,” saying that the case against him was a “disgrace.” He also attacked the New York Attorney General Letitia James for going after him instead of violent crime.\n\n“We’re going to be here for months with a judge that already made up his mind. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said.\n\n“They waste their time with this, with banks that were very happy that got all their money back. They weren’t defrauded. I’ve been defrauded,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he was coming back to the courtroom after lunch, Trump said, “probably.”\n\nEngoron ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case, one of the seven claims that are a part of the lawsuit.\n\nWatching Trump\'s body language in court\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not expressed much emotion in the courtroom for the first session of the criminal fraud trial.\n\nDuring the four opening statements, Trump sat at the defense table between two of his lawyers. He never spoke to the judge. Trump often faced forward, watching the small video monitor in front of him which displayed the opening presentations by the state and his defense lawyer.\n\nWhen Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, who are lawyers for Trump’s co-defendants, spoke without video presentations, Trump looked at them intently. Habba, who represents Allen Weiselberg, Jeff McConney and other employees of the Trump Organization, at times turned to Trump when she was discussing the valuation of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, answered questions from the judge, Trump wrote notes and passed them to him. Eric Trump, who is also a defendant, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery, on the defense side behind and to his father’s left. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sat in the front row on the other side of the courtroom, behind the former president and about 15 feet to his right.\n\nTrump only once looked at James, as he left the courtroom for the lunch break, turning his head as he walked past where she was seated. Eric Trump stopped and shook her hands using both of his hands as he followed his father out of the courtroom.\n\nJudge pushes back after Trump lawyer attacks New York attorney general in opening statement\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron rebutted attacks from Donald Trump’s attorney Alina Habba against New York Attorney General Letitia James, responding to her opening statement and getting into a debate with the attorney over her claims.\n\nIn her statement, Habba attacked James for saying in her campaign for attorney general that she was going to “get Trump.”\n\nEngoron, who ruled last week that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud in the attorney general’s civil case against Trump, responded by noting that the defense already tried to dismiss the case claiming that James brought it as a “witch hunt” against Trump.\n\nTrump intently watched Habba as she sparred with the judge.\n\n“These statements of financial condition were current, current market value. The point is what were they worth then,” Engoron said, pushing back on Habba’s assertion that the inflated values showed what they could be sold for at some point in the future.\n\nAn accounting disclaimer from Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm, essentially said, “We’re relying on the Trump Organization,” Engoron said. “That’s how I read it.”\n\n“No, your honor,” Habba responded, arguing that the Trump Organization relied on Mazars and “they’re the accountants.”\n\nTrump lawyer claims Mar-a-Lago would sell for $1 billion in opening statement\n\nAlina Habba, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, and other Trump Organization employees, delivered an opening statement in court Monday attacking New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nHabba’s comments echoed Trump — who has tried to tie the civil case against him in New York as an effort to attack him and his presidential campaign.\n\n“Ms. James said she was going to come into office and ‘get Trump,’” Habba said, claiming that the case could have been brought three years ago before she took office.\n\nHabba also criticized the valuations the judge gave for properties like Mar-a-Lago, which the judge valued at $18 million in his ruling last week, finding Trump and his co-defendants liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nHabba argued that if Trump was trying to show a higher net worth, he would have included things like the rights to “The Apprentice” and the Trump brand.\n\n“There would have been the brand, the same brand that got that man elected for president,” she said. “There’s a lot of people in this room that probably don’t like that and that’s why we’re here.”\n\nTrump was looking at Habba as she spoke in the courtroom.\n\nFact check: The Trump campaign leaves out this year\'s crime declines while attacking Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign deployed out-of-date crime data about New York City in a Monday attack on state Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the lawsuit in which the former president is now facing a civil fraud trial for inflating asset valuations on financial statements.\n\nIn a news release the campaign distributed shortly before Trump appeared in a New York courtroom for the start of the trial, the former president’s campaign delivered a variety of attacks against James — one of them pointing out that she received a campaign donation from liberal billionaire George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist and Democratic donor who has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories baselessly depicting him as a puppet master behind various domestic and international events.\n\nThe Trump campaign concluded the Monday release by claiming that New York crime has “skyrocketed” under James, who took office in 2019. But the campaign repeatedly used crime data from 2021 or 2022 even though more recent data is available — making the crime picture look worse than it is, since the situation with some major crime categories has improved markedly this year and last.\n\nFor example, the Trump campaign said, “In New York City, shootings increased by 71% from 2018 to 2022.”\n\nWhile that’s accurate, the campaign didn’t mention that the number of shootings in the city has plummeted by about 27% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022 — after also falling about 17% for the full year of 2022 compared to the full year of 2021.\n\nIn other words, the Trump campaign didn’t explain that New York City is now well into a second straight year with an improving shootings trendline, and, if current trends roughly hold for the rest of the year, that 2023 will end with a much less than 71% increase over the number of shootings compared to 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the Trump campaign said, “Murders increased by 48% from 2018 to 2022 in New York City.” The Trump campaign didn’t mention that the number of murders in the city declined by about 10% in 2022 and has fallen by about 11% so far in 2023 compared to the same point in 2022. Again, the trendline is well into a second year of significant improvement.\n\nAnd the numbers aside, it’s also highly questionable at best to blame or credit an individual attorney general for the crime situation in their state.\n\nThe number of murders spiked around the country beginning in 2020, when there was widespread economic and social upheaval because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has improved around the country in 2022 and 2023 — complicating attempts to assign blame for the increases or credit for the decreases to any particular state or local official.\n\nIn addition, the precise causes of crime fluctuations are difficult to pinpoint even decades after the fact; they are affected by numerous factors, from the economy to government policy to sociocultural factors to policing strategies to the corrections system.\n\nTrump posts clips of New York attorney general talking about suing the former president\n\nVideos of New York Attorney General Letitia James talking about suing Donald Trump were being posted on the former president’s social media account while he sat inside a Manhattan courtroom for the civil fraud trial that James brought against him.\n\nTrump is arguing that the case, which began Monday, is politically motivated.\n\nIn one video, James can be heard saying, “Oh we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.”\n\nIn another clip, she says, “What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.”\n\nThe videos are posted on social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“New York embarrassment Letitia James is politically targeting President Trump,” the text in one video reads. “Letitia James is abusing her office.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyer: ""He has made a fortune literally about being right about real estate""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Chris Kise began his opening statement with an understatement, saying their team has a “very different picture of the evidence.”\n\nKise said the former president’s real estate knowledge made him a billionaire.\n\nTrump continues to look ahead at the monitor displaying his organization’s loan agreements, and occasionally leaning over talking to his lawyer.\n\n“There may be wide variations between different valuations” of certain parts of the Trump Org.’s real estate portfolio, Kise said, but added the evidence at trial will show the asset valuations on Trump’s statements of financial condition comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nIn pictures: Trump in court for civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at a New York City courthouse Monday for the start of a civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nLast week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a $250 million lawsuit last year alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nSee photos from inside and around the courthouse today:\n\nTrump claims civil fraud case is part of ""election interference"" against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed before walking into court Monday that the New York Attorney General’s civil case against him was part of an attempt to harm his campaign.\n\n“This has to do with election interference, plain and simple,” Trump said. “They’re trying to damage me, so I don’t do as well as I’m doing in the election.”\n\nTrump’s claims about election interference are the same attacks he’s made against all four of the criminal indictments against him.\n\nBefore entering the New York courtroom Monday, Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, as well as Manhattan District Attorney General Alvin Bragg and the Justice Department, linking the civil action against him in New York with his criminal indictments, even though they are not related.\n\nTrump is surrounded by his attorneys in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is seated in a New York City courtroom flanked by his attorneys on each side of him.\n\nHis son Eric Trump is seated in the front row of the gallery on the defense side.\n\nThere are at least nine court officers in the room.\n\nTrump didn\'t look at Attorney General Letitia James as he entered the court\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seated in the front row of the courtroom, on the prosecution’s side and next to one of the aisles.\n\nAfter speaking with reporters in the hallway and calling James a “racist,” Trump entered the courtroom through the main doors about 15 feet to her right. The former president walked directly in front of her and did not appear to look in her direction.\n\nHe is sitting with his attorneys Christopher Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nTrump calls the civil fraud trial ""a scam"" and ""a sham""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Monday that the civil fraud trial against him and his associates that is set to begin soon is a “continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time.”\n\nHe made the comments as he made his way to the courtroom where the trial will begin.\n\nTrump went on to attack Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “she was going to ‘get Trump’ before she even knew anything about me.”\n\n“She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor,” he said. “She had virtually no following. She came back and she said, ‘well, now I will go back to get Trump again.’ And this what we have. It is a scam and a sham.”\n\nTrump added that his financial statements “are phenomenal,” and claimed, “no bank was affected, no bank was hurt.”\n\nDonald Trump appears in courthouse hallway\n\nDonald Trump walked through the hallway in court ahead of his civil fraud trial. He is talking to reporters right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court gives one win to Trump today\n\nThere have been a smattering of attempts to remove Donald Trump from the ballot next year based on his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court said it won’t take up one of those longshot challenges, rejecting an appeal from John Anthony Castro, a little-known candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCastro’s case against Trump leans on a post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution is disqualified from holding future office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.\n\nThe case was denied without any comment or recorded vote.\n\nThere are still 14th Amendment challenges against Trump in Minnesota and Colorado, which are scheduled for trials later this year.\n\nEric Trump arrives at court\n\nDonald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has arrived at the New York City court ahead of the civil fraud trial against the former president, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nThe civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nNew York attorney general: ""No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law""\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in a short statement Monday morning, “My message is simple: No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law.”\n\nThe attorney general noted that last week, a state Supreme Court judge found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud for grossly inflating asset valuations on financial statements. The trial that begins today will determine the amount of damages owed.\n\nWatch the moment here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n980b6c7f-2a43-4e1c-8c67-e5eeeb5f987e.mp4\n\n00:44 - Source: CNN\n\nHere\'s what it\'s like inside the court where Trump\'s civil trial will play out\n\nThe civil fraud trial that former President Donald Trump will attend today is in the large third floor courtroom: room 300 of the 60 Centre Street building.\n\nPaintings on the wall depict the early courts of New York City, including the popular law courts of New Netherlands in the 1600s.\n\nThere are various computer display screens arranged for the parties, and two large screens for the court and the gallery.\n\nThere are nine rows of wood benches, with two aisles and some chairs on the side. Altogether, available seating exceeds 100 people.\n\nPeople are still arriving.\n\nTrump heads to court for first day of civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump departed from Trump Tower and is en route to a New York City courthouse to attend the first day of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nMore on the trial: Opening statements in the trial over inflated assets will begin today. The trial comes less than a week after a ruling that found Trump and his co-defendants liable for “repeated” fraud.\n\nThe former president, his adult children and his closest business advisers are all listed as potential witnesses for both the New York attorney general and the defense. Being listed as a potential witness, however, does not mean they will be called to testify.\n\nDonald Trump and his adult children on witness lists in New York civil fraud case\n\nDonald Trump, his adult children, and his closest business advisors could be called to testify during the civil fraud trial expected to begin Monday in New York.\n\nTrump is listed on the witness lists submitted by the New York Attorney General and Trump’s legal team. The state and Trump’s lawyers need to be inclusive on their witness lists of any potential person they might want to call, or the judge could exclude the testimony.\n\nTrump previously sat for a deposition in the case and said he had little “if any” role in preparing the financial statements that a New York judge ruled last week were fraudulent.\n\nAlso on both lists are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, defendants in the case and numerous current and former Trump Organization employees, including former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Most of the witnesses have also testified in video depositions\n\nIn civil cases defendants can be called to testify and, if they refuse the jury, or in this case the judge, can use that against them in weighing the evidence.\n\nThe New York attorney general’s office identified 28 witnesses they could call in the case, including Michael Cohen and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka Trump was initially a defendant in the case, but a New York appeals court struck her from the lawsuit saying the claims brought against her were too old.\n\nTrump’s attorneys identified 127 possible witnesses that they would call, including some of the lenders behind the loans at issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial begins today. Here\'s what to know\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be in attendance Monday in a New York courtroom for the start of the civil fraud trial against him, his eldest sons, their companies and Trump Organization executives.\n\nOpening statements in the civil trial over inflated assets in fraudulent financial statements come less than a week after a shocking ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron that found Trump and his co-defendants are liable for “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nThe ruling was a significant victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the $250 million lawsuit last September alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nTrump inflated his net worth by as much as $3.6 billion in three separate years between 2011 and 2021, according to the attorney general’s office. Attorneys for Trump have refuted the claims, arguing that asset valuations are highly subjective and that they are still sorting through what the ruling means for the company’s future.\n\nWhat’s at stake at trial: Trump and his companies could be forced to pay hefty sums in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through their fraudulent business practices.\n\nEngoron will consider just how much the Trumps and their businesses will have to pay.\n\nThe judge is expected to consider claims of business records fraud and insurance fraud alleged in the lawsuit in connection to high-profile properties, though he already determined some broad level of fraud was perpetuated.\n\nThe six causes of action are falsifying business records, conspiracy to falsify business records, issuing false financial statements, conspiracy to falsify false financial statements, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\n\nJames’ lawsuit also asks the court to consider banning the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York and to stop the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.\n\nRead more about Trump’s fraud trial.\n\nTrump says he will attend his civil fraud trial in New York\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he will go to court in New York for his civil fraud trial on Monday.\n\nTrump had been expected to attend, and law enforcement and court employees had already been making security preparations for his potential appearance at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan on Monday and possibly Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s plans started to become clear after a federal judge in Florida granted his request to postpone a deposition in a separate case because it would conflict with the start of the New York trial.\n\nThe civil fraud case – brought in September 2022 by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his eldest sons, their companies and several executives – will begin at 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nRemember: Last week, the judge overseeing the case dealt Trump a major blow in ruling that the former president is liable for fraud and that he overvalued his properties on his financial statements for a decade.\n\nThe ruling came in response to the lawsuit by James, who is seeking $250 million in damages, a ban on the Trumps from serving as officers of a business in New York, and a ban on the company from engaging in business transactions for five years.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-testify-defense-new-york-civil-fraud-trial-rcna126834', 'Headline': 'Trump to testify in his own defense in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': ""Former President Donald Trump will take the stand in his own defense next month in his $250 million civil fraud trial, his attorneys said in court Monday.

In the week preceding the former president\'s testimony, his son Eric Trump is scheduled to take the stand Dec. 6, Kise added. Both have already testified in the case as witnesses for New York Attorney General Letitia James\' office, who\'s suing the Trumps and their company alleging they inflated financial statements to the tune of billions of dollars.\n\nSeparately, Trump\'s attorneys told a New York state appeals court Monday that he\'s not responsible for what court officials have called a ""deluge"" of threats against the law clerk of the judge presiding over the civil fraud trial. They also dismissed the assertion in a court filing last week that Trump has endangered the clerk\'s safety.\n\nThe ""purported security concerns lack good faith and substance,"" and ""the communications themselves, while vile and reprehensible, do not constitute a clear and present danger of imminent harm,"" Trump\'s lawyers argued in a filing to the state Appellate Division, urging it to leave in place a pause of Judge Arthur Engoron\'s gag order barring Trump and his attorneys from publicly discussing the clerk.\n\nIn last week\'s filing, lawyers for the state court system urged the appeals court to end a temporary pause on the gag order, arguing that ever since Trump posted about the clerk on social media last month, she has been subjected to ""hundreds of threatening, harassing, disparaging and antisemitic messages,"" including on her personal cellphone and email. A court security official, Charles Hollon, submitted a sworn affirmation saying that some of the threats against the judge and the clerk ""are considered to be serious and credible and not hypothetical or speculative"" and that they led to increased security.\n\nTrump\'s attorneys said that their client had no involvement with the threats and that he shouldn’t be prohibited from airing his belief that the clerk is biased against him.\n\n""The Constitution does not permit Justice Engoron to curtail [Trump\'s] speech simply because people may react to things that President Trump says,"" they wrote.\n\nThe state Office of Court Administration, on behalf of Engoron, argued differently in its filing. ""The First Amendment does not prohibit courts from limiting speech that threatens the safety of the court’s staff,"" its lawyer Lisa Evans wrote.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Kise said the gag order ""seeks to shield the Court from the scrutiny essential to maintaining public confidence in the judiciary and the rule of law. So, it is beyond outrageous that an unconstitutional gag order could prevent the frontrunning presidential candidate from speaking about obvious, public, and partisan conduct which has denied him a fair trial.”\n\nThe state attorney general\'s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on Trump\'s filing.\n\nEngoron issued the gag order on the second day of the trial after Trump posted a picture of the clerk posing with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and baselessly claimed that she had a romantic relationship with him, an allegation Schumer\'s office has called ""ridiculous, absurd, and false."" The picture was taken at a political event while the clerk was running for a judgeship, and it had originally been posted on her campaign\'s Instagram page.\n\n“Personal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it,” Engoron said after he found out about Trump\'s social media post and comments he made to reporters about the clerk.\n\nIn their filing Monday, Trump\'s lawyers called it ""manufactured outrage,"" because the clerk ""herself initially posted the very same photograph on a public Instagram account explicitly linked to her judicial campaign, with her name in the handle."" The clerk made the page private after Trump\'s post appeared on Truth Social.\n\nAfter the gag order was imposed, Trump\'s lawyers repeatedly complained about the clerk in court, saying she\'d been showing bias by rolling her eyes and whispering to the judge while they were questioning witnesses. They also took issue with her physical proximity to Engoron and said she appears to be acting as a ""co-judge,"" an allegation that Engoron has repeatedly — and angrily — denied.\n\nEngoron expanded his gag order to include the lawyers this month and said he will “continue to consult with my staff, as is my unfettered right, throughout the remainder of the trial.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyers countered that Engoron ""feels compelled to repeatedly justify his abnormal practices and assure the public that he, not his law clerk, is fulfilling his judicial duties, underscores the bizarre and deeply problematic nature of his practices. There is simply no room in the judicial system for openly partisan individuals to participate at all in the decision-making process.""\n\nThey also contended that the clerk\'s ""heightened public role"" in the case, including allowing herself to be photographed in court sitting by the judge, ""renders her a public figure, subject to public criticism, for purposes of the proceeding.""\n\nThe ""purported security concerns are disingenuous given the Principal Law Clerk’s voluntary public, partisan posts and political activities and her insistence in remaining as a constant and unprecedented presence on the bench, allowing herself to be filmed and then viewed by an audience of millions since the underlying, extraordinarily high-profile trial commenced,"" the lawyers argued.\n\nIt\'s unclear when the appeals court will rule on the gag order.\n\nDuring Monday\'s court proceedings, Trump\'s attorneys moved to call as a witness Barbara Jones, the retired federal judge whom Engoron appointed as a monitor of financial activity at the Trump Organization. Engoron rejected the request, which came weeks after Trump\'s team began presenting their case. Engoron called the request ""untimely"" and ""inappropriate.""\n\n""I’m not aware of a single instance where a litigant asks to examine an independent monitor,"" he said.\n\nThe witness who was on the stand Monday, Trump Organization executive Mark Hawthorn, testified that he had a good relationship with Jones and her team and that they seemed satisfied with how the company is being run. ""There were concerns they highlighted that required more, and we responded diligently and adequately, but I would say no one from that team communicated to us that they uncovered any fraud or irregularities,"" Hawthorn said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Hawthorn was asked whether he was aware that Jones had reported to the judge that some of the information she\'d gotten from the company was ""incomplete"" and that the company had ""also not consistently provided all required annual and quarterly certifications attesting to the accuracy of certain financial statements."" He replied, ""Yes.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-us-canada-66978988', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump in New York court for $250m civil fraud trial - live ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'The tone was set before court even started when former president Donald Trump lashed out at both the prosecution and the judge.

During the day he also called for Judge Arthur Engoron to be disbarred.\n\nThe morning session was a back and forward between sides, with the judge occasionally needing to interject to set things straight.\n\nIt\'s shaping up to be a fiery trial.\n\nIf you want more information about the fraud case, you can watch the video at the top of this post.\n\nAnd this article highlights five things you need to know about the court case.\n\nOur court reporters today have been Nada Tawfik and Madeline Halpert.\n\nAnd our writers were Brandon Drenon, Victoria Lindrea and Mike Wendling.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\nTrump leaves court and once again gripes about having no jury\n\nDonald Trump seemed in a better mood at the conclusion of the day compared to his earlier statements.\n\nBut he did once again bring up his frustrations at not having a jury in this trial, which he called ""unusual"".\n\nThe judge had earlier told the court that there was no jury because the lawyers did not request a jury trial.\n\nTrump was also non-committal on if he would be back at court tomorrow, saying he might return but would rather be campaigning.\n\nWho is Alina Habba?\n\nDonald Bender is still giving testimony about being an accountant for Trump, but let\'s take a moment to talk about Alina Habba - a New Jersey-based lawyer who the New York Post labelled a ""firebrand"".\n\nHabba is the most Googled name of people involved in this trial (outside of Donald Trump, of course).\n\nHabba has become one of Trump\'s most trusted attorneys since she was hired in 2021.\n\nEarlier in her career, Habba worked as an executive at the renowned New York fashion designer Marc Jacobs. The 39-year-old mother-of-three was a relatively unknown civil litigation lawyer before working for Trump.\n\nSpeaking outside of a Miami courthouse in Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, she fiercely defended the former president.\n\n“The decision to pursue charges against President Trump while turning a blind eye to others is emblematic of the corruption that we have here,” Habba said.\n\nCurrently, Habba holds the managing partner position at Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, located near Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nWhat did Trump post online during the break?\n\nMike Wendling\n\nUS disinformation reporter\n\nWhen the court took a break, Trump took to his Truth Social network to once again rail against the judge and legal system.\n\nHe posted: “The highly political, Trump Hating Judge just stated that expert testimony is not evidence. Well, that means that every trial in American history has to be thrown out and started all over again!”\n\nTrump appears to be referring not to an actual ruling about the admissibility of expert testimony, but to a back-and-forth between the judge and his lawyer this morning about the weight to be given to a valuation by a specific expert.\n\nRemember, it’s the value of Trump’s properties that are key to this trial.\n\nTrump seems to be exaggerating for effect – it\'s hard to believe he really thinks the judge could invalidate the entire US legal system – but surely the former president and his lawyers will continue to disagree with the judge, both inside the court and online.\n\nMichael Cohen, the Trump supporter turned critic\n\nEarlier, the name Michael Cohen was brought up in court.\n\nSo who is he? Cohen is Donald Trump\'s former personal attorney, once known as his ""fixer"".\n\nCohen worked for Trump for more than a decade at the Trump Organization, as well as on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and at the Republican National Committee.\n\nHe was sentenced to federal prison in December 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and related crimes that happened while he was working for the ex-president.\n\nCohen then testified to a grand jury - transforming himself from Trump supporter to Trump critic.\n\nHe revealed details about alleged hush money payments he made to a porn star under Trump\'s instruction. His testimony led to Trump\'s eventual indictment on similar charges.\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC, Cohen said this New York civil fraud trial could be a “financial catastrophe” and a “deathblow to Donald”.\n\n“I can tell you this has always been his biggest fear. That he would lose all of his money and he would no longer be considered the mega-billionaire,” Cohen said.\n\nTrump hits out at judge before heading back into court\n\nThe former president just spoke to media for a brief moment outside the courtroom.\n\n""This judge should be disbarred. He shouldn\'t be allowed to be a judge,"" Trump says.\n\nIt\'s one of the same lines of attack he used in his statement this morning before court started.\n\nTrump has also been posting on his Truth Social media account in the past hour, saying once again that this is a ""witch hunt"".\n\nMar-a-Lago worth \'at least a billion\', Trump\'s lawyer says\n\nWhile court takes a break, let\'s look back at some more of what Trump\'s lawyer Alina Habba had to say.\n\nHabba was critical of the real estate valuations given to Trump\'s 17-acre Mar-a-Lago estate on the Florida coast.\n\nLast week, Judge Engoron ruled that the estate was over-valued by as much as 2,300% in one financial statement. He said the estate was likely valued between $18m and $27.6m.\n\nBut Habba says the value is whatever someone is willing to pay.\n\nShe says Mar-a-Lago would sell for ""at least a billion"".\n\nHubba said Trump\'s Doral golf course would also sell for at least a billion dollars.\n\nShe calls them ""Mona Lisa properties"" and says it\'s not fraud, it\'s just how real estate works.'}}",95.0,1

Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened.\n\nMore Than 15,000 Attended Trump’s Arizona Rally\n\nThe rally took place at the Country Thunder Festival Grounds, AZ Central reported. Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. MST, with doors opening for the rally at 2 p.m. His speech began a bit later than scheduled, at about 7:17 p.m. Other speakers included Kari Lake, state Rep. Mark Finchem, Rep. Paul Gosar, Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Debbie Lesko, Kelli Ward, Mike Lindell, and Boris Epshteyn, Axios reported.\n\nIn the afternoon, just a couple of hours after doors opened, thousands of people were already at the festival grounds, AZ Central reported. The publication noted that traffic was stalled for about an hour outside the rally venue, and some attendees still hadn’t gotten inside after waiting more than three hours.\n\nYahoo! News (via the Arizona Republic) reported that more than 15,000 were in attendance at the rally. Meanwhile, Liz Willis of the right-wing network RSBN had indicated during the rally that attendance was about 20,000, according to a tweet that her official account retweeted. The Town of Florence Police Department had written on January 13 that they projected an attendance of close to 30,000.\n\nSteven Monacelli of Rolling Stone, The Daily Beast, and Dallas Weekly tweeted that when he arrived at the rally, he and other members of the press were told the press tower was full, even while others were still being let in the gates.\n\nHe later shared that although some of the press who were with him weren’t allowed inside, he was able to get into the rally.\n\nEd Henry of the conservative publication Real America’s Voice shared these photos of the crowd.\n\nWill Steakin of ABC News tweeted that Anthony Kern, a former Arizona lawmaker who was at the Capitol on January 6, addressed the crowd before Trump and told the rally: “This is our 1776 movement.”\n\nSteakin said the crowd could be heard saying “lock him up” at one point, in reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHere’s another crowd photo, shared by Monacelli on Twitter:\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, he called Biden “a disaster” for the country and let Kari Lake join him briefly on the stage. Lake is the Republican candidate for governor.\n\nHe also vowed during his speech to have his own investigation of the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nSteakin reported that Trump’s rally ended with a new song by Sam and Dave called, “Hold on I’m Coming.”\n\nOn Twitter, the video below was shared showing the crowd at the rally.\n\nTrump said in the video above that some officials indicated this might be the “single biggest crowd seen yet.” However, other Trump rallies have recorded attendance numbers larger than the current estimate of 15,000. A 2019 Minneapolis Trump rally, for example, had a low estimate of 20,000, not including overflow. Trump did add: “and they’re not just talking about Arizona,” to his statement about the crowd size.\n\nThis Was Trump’s First Rally of 2022\n\nThis was Trump’s first rally of 2022. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election or not.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-disputes-2020-election-loss-arizona-rally-crowd-size-traffic-2022-1', 'Headline': 'Trump Disputes 2020 Loss at Ariz.

Biden — who had sought to adhere to social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic — generally stuck with hosting outdoor campaign events like drive-in rallies.\n\nTrump has teased a 2024 presidential run for almost a year, notably at rallies he held in support of Republican candidates last year, and did so again Saturday.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview in November, Trump said a final decision was still up in the air.\n\n""I am certainly thinking about it and we\'ll see,"" he told the outlet.

A brand-new conspiracy theory? But you can always rely on the former president to brag about the size of the crowd. He will remark happily upon the gridlocked traffic getting into the event. He will exclaim that he cannot even pinpoint exactly where the crowd ends. And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true.

Within minutes of taking the stage Saturday ...', 'Full_text': 'Turns out there’s nothing new under the spray tan either.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump stuck to his favorite topics at his Arizona rally: the size of his crowd and false claims that the election was stolen. Within minutes of taking the stage Saturday, after he bragged about crowd size, Trump claimed the “proof is all over the place” that the election was stolen (it was not). “The big lie is a lot of bullshit,” Trump said accurately, though not in the way he thinks.\n\n“I ran twice, I won twice. … We did much better the second time,” Trump falsely claimed while referencing an election he definitively lost. “The people are hungry for the truth. They want their country back.” Encouraging the crowd to vote, Trump told them, “Get out and vote. Make sure it’s not a rigged vote, please.” At one point, Trump pulled Arizona gubernatorial candidate and former news anchor Kari Lake onstage, where she proclaimed without irony that the founding fathers would have supported Trump, the president who subverted democracy and the rule of law at almost every opportunity.\n\n“Look at the people, as far as the eye can see,” Trump said, returning to boasting about attendance. “Way back, I mean, football fields back. … Nobody’s ever had a movement like this. Nobody’s ever had spirit like this or a crowd like this.” Later in the speech, Trump circled back to crowd size, marveling at the number of people at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — lauding a crowd that threatened elected lawmakers who were conducting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of power. He then pushed a conspiracy theory favored by Steve Bannon, as well as far-right GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz, that the federal government was behind the Jan. 6 violence.\n\nThe former president also bashed Dr. Anthony Fauci as the audience erupted into a chorus of “Lock him up! Lock him up!” Fauci, at a congressional hearing this week, spoke emotionally about how his family faces persistent death threats because of the way the Republican Party has demonized him.\n\nEven before the former president took the stage, a parade of cronies warmed up the crowd with religious overtones, a promise to jail Fauci, and unfounded allegations of election fraud. Mike Lindell — the “My Pillow Guy”-turned-election-fraud-investigator — promised that the 2020 presidential election would be overturned. Explaining why Trump hadn’t yet been gloriously returned to his rightful place in the White House, Lindell said that it would happen on “God’s timing, not our timing.” Lindell then made a seemingly impossible claim: that the entire 2022 election will be conducted manually and, presumably, will be hand counted. “I will promise you this, there’s not going to be any election done with machines or computers done in 2022,” Lindell said. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) didn’t make that same promise, but he did inject “Let’s go, Brandon,” into his speech.\n\nThe rally, much like the one that preceded it, was a rehash of the Big Lie, the same dangerous rhetoric that encouraged Trump’s supporters to launch a violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, posing a real threat to our democracy. But the attempted coup failed, dooming Trump to holding rallies and feeding his supporters a steady stream of bullshit to keep them fired up for the midterms and his potential 2024 run. After all, supporters will continue to show up and treat him as the god emperor they believe him to be.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/23/trump-pence-arizona-rally-00047568', 'Headline': 'Trump and Pence squared off in the desert.

We can’t let them get away with it.”\n\nEarlier speakers had kept to similar themes, slamming President Joe Biden as “weak” and “deranged,” and taking aim at the “lamestream media,” who were duly booed by the crowd.\n\nIt was a greatest hits of Trumpism, playing all the expected notes: a stolen election, the unfairness of the media, open borders and how the United States has become “a laughing stock all over the world.”\n\nThere was a carnival feeling for much of the day.\n\nFlags proclaiming ""Trump 2020"" and ""Trump 2024"" fluttered in the desert wind, as chants of ""Let\'s Go, Brandon"" erupted from good-natured supporters, many of whom were in a party mood.\n\nThe slogan has become code in right-wing circles after a news reporter mistook anti-Joe Biden chants.\n\n""It\'s just a party atmosphere,"" said Mr Jonathan Riches, who was attending his 40th Trump rally.\n\n""It\'s almost like a Maga (Make America Great Again) Woodstock. It\'s patriots from around the country getting together for the common good of this country. We love our president.""\n\nMs Jennifer Winterbauer, who was at the head of the line waiting, said she had come to hear ""the truth"" from Mr Trump.\n\n""He always gives the truth about everything. The economy, the state of the world, the United States.""\n\n\'Biggest crowd\'\n\nMr Trump abandoned a pledged press conference on Jan 6 - the anniversary of the invasion of the Capitol by his supporters - and the rally is his first outing in front of a large crowd since October.\n\nAs is customary, Mr Trump proclaimed it to be “the biggest” crowd that went “further than the eye can see,” though accurate figures on attendance were not immediately available.\n\nIn the lead up to his election win in 2016, and throughout his presidency, tens of thousands of supporters would throng venues to hear him speak. But crowds have since dwindled, and Saturday’s turnout appeared to be far below those of earlier rallies.\n\nThe gathering, on farmland 100km from Phoenix, featured a raft of Republicans who have echoed Mr Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 election was fixed.\n\nThey included Ms Kari Lake, whom Mr Trump has endorsed for governor of Arizona in this year’s race. She has previously said she would not have certified Mr Biden’s victory if she had been in office at the time.\n\nMr Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, who has spent millions of dollars trying to overturn the election, with a focus on the machines used to count ballots, told the crowd he was not going to give up. “And I will promise you this, there’s not gonna be any election with any machines or computers done in 2022,” he said.\n\nMr Trump, who lost his Twitter megaphone for his claims about the poll, has been a much lower-key presence in US politics since leaving office.\n\nBut he still looms large in the Republican party, where adherence to his theories - or at least not publicly denying them - is often vital to survival for members of Congress and state legislatures.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/01/14/trump-rally-arizona-live-updates-florence/6529316001/', 'Headline': 'Trump rally in Arizona: LIVE updates from Florence - azcentral.com', 'Snippet': ""Former President Trump's first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona, where several Republican candidates took the stage as well."", 'Full_text': 'Former President Donald Trump\'s first rally of 2022 will be in Florence, where several Republican candidates will take the stage as well.\n\nTrump\'s appearance Saturday will be his second in the state since leaving office and underscores his continued importance in GOP circles nearly one year after departing the White House.\n\nFollow coverage of the Trump rally by Republic reporters here throughout the day Saturday.\n\nPAST COVERAGE BY THE REPUBLIC\n\nDEMOCRACY IN DOUBT: Trump, allies pushed to undermine 2020 election\n\nHOW WE GOT HERE: An Arizona election audit timeline\n\nARIZONA ELECTION REVIEW DISCREDITED: \'Results were meaningless\': Analysts say they cannot validate or replicate Cyber Ninjas\' hand count of votes\n\nMARICOPA COUNTY RESPONSE: Cyber Ninjas\' report was misleading, inaccurate and false, county says\n\n10 p.m.: Speech hits mark with Florence crowd\n\nWearing a pink Trump cowboy hat and clutching several ""Let’s Go Brandon” hats, Kaia Sisk of Mesa clung on the former president’s every word.\n\n“I love it,” she said.\n\nFlorence was Sisk’s third Trump rally.\n\n“He’s awesome,” Sisk said. “He is funny. I love his personality. He’s fun.”\n\nJonathan Foright of Washington said Trump’s message Saturday was important and engaging.\n\nEspecially when it comes to protecting Americans and “when he talks about the danger to democracy and our freedom,” Foright said.\n\n“He’s trying to do everything he can to protect that freedom,” he said.\n\nThe existential threat to liberty is one of the reasons Foright said he is in the process of moving from the Northwest to Florida.\n\nForight called Trump a good man.

Many people leaving the venue had to wait more than an hour before they could exit the dirt parking lots and get on the road.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n9:15 p.m.: Trump uses rally to bash Biden, Ducey\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used his 93-minute remarks at his rally in Florence to give a fresh blistering to his usual foils President Joe Biden, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and the media to the resounding support of the thousands of diehard supporters at Canyon Moon Ranch.\n\nTrump also renewed his grievances and cast his four years in office as a period of unprecedented prosperity and security.\n\nEarly in his remarks, which ended at 8:51 p.m., Trump cast Biden\'s administration as an unfolding disaster and continued his baseless claims of widespread election fraud in 2020.\n\n""Biden has utterly humiliated our nation,"" Trump said, saying that Russia and China\'s leaders no longer respect or fear America.\n\nTrump said the past year under Biden has been a ""disaster"" but said there would be a good political end to the ""catastrophe"" at the outset of the new year.\n\nThe speech was an updated version of Trump’s usual America-first rhetoric, long on personal boasts and lacking in subtlety.\n\n“The country is being destroyed,” he said, after citing rising inflation and the nation’s disastrous retreat from Afghanistan. “Our country is being totally destroyed.”\n\nTrump called the COVID-19 response under Biden a disaster, from vaccine mandates to testing shortages.\n\n“I’m proud I was the anti-mandate president,” Trump said. “We gave Biden every tool he could want. &mldr; He’s incapable.”\n\nTrump kept much of his speech focused on Biden, noting the president’s dismal approval ratings and accusing him of being clueless on tackling the nation’s current problems.\n\nTrump repeated his criticism of former ally Gov. Doug Ducey, a fellow Republican who is mulling a run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\n“He’s not going to get my endorsement,” Trump said of Ducey. “Ducey has been a terrible, terrible representative of your state.”\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n8:25 p.m.: Trump denounces prosecution of Jan. 6 rioters\n\nDonald Trump blasted the House of Representatives select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe called the U.S. prosecution of defendants charged with storming the Capitol an “appalling persecution of political prisoners.”\n\nHe said many of the people at the Capitol were FBI informants, not Trump supporters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump described the supporters he spoke to from the Ellipse, near the White House, on Jan. 6 before the attack on the Capitol as one of the largest crowds he’s ever seen.\n\nTrump called the officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt inside the Capitol a “dope.”\n\nTrump pointed to social protests during 2020 and asked why the Department of Justice wasn’t going after people who participated in them. “Why aren’t they doing it to Antifa and Black Lives Matter?” he said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:25 p.m.: Former President Trump takes the stage\n\nAfter more than two hours of speeches by other politicians, Trump took the stage at 7:17 p.m. with Lee Greenwood\'s ""God Bless the USA"" playing.\n\nHis first sentences mentioned a ""rigged election,"" ""The Big Lie is a lot of bullshit"" and ""I ran twice and I won twice.""\n\nHe called Joe Biden, who defeated him in the 2020 election, ""a disaster for this country.""\n\nHe mentioned unseating U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., in 2022 and electing Kari Lake as governor.\n\nLake joined Trump on stage briefly and pledged, ""We will finish your big beautiful wall.""\n\n— Kathy Tulumello\n\nOut for Arizona governor: Kimberly Yee will run for reelection as treasurer\n\n7:25 p.m.: Gubernatorial candidate captures hearts in crowd\n\nKari Lake took to the stage with a canned soundtrack of applause booming out of the speakers – but she didn’t need it.\n\nThe crowd embraced the former TV New anchor turned gubernatorial candidate. Her message of cracking down on undocumented immigrants, canceling mask mandates and anti-abortion legislation resonated strongly.\n\n“I love her,” said Evelyn Harless of Mesa. “Everything she said needs to happen &mldr; She’s going to get something done for Arizona.”\n\nHarless, who turned 70 last year, had never attended a political rally before coming to Florence Saturday. And while Trump was the headliner, Lake stole her heart.\n\n“She is just true to her word,” she said.\n\nHarless said she thought Lake’s stance on border security was tough and direct. “I like people coming into this country. I just want it done legally,” she said.\n\nJohn LeTourneau of Mesa used the same words to describe his adulation for Lake: “I love her,” he said.\n\nLeTourneau said he will have no trouble voting for her for governor.\n\n“She’s honest, sincere and wants to fix things that are wrong with Arizona,” he said.\n\nHe praised her stance on the border and keeping elections secure. And he said her criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president on COVID-19, were welcome.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “Fauci is crooked as hell.”\n\nFor Lisa Pray, a soon-to-be-grandma from Dewey, it was Lake’s message of pushing anti-abortion legislation that moved her.\n\nShe said she is proud Lake is willing to push “heartbeat laws” and showed a sonogram picture of her daughter’s new child: “That’s not a fetus. That’s a baby.”\n\nPray said Lake represents Arizona, “she represents us.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n7:20 p.m.: Democrats issue statement on Trump rally\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesperson Adonna Biel released a statement before former President Donald Trump spoke in Florence.\n\n“Let there be no mistake, the Republican Party has surrendered to Donald Trump’s stranglehold and fully embraced him no matter the cost to our democracy or Americans’ lives,"" it read in part.\n\n""Tonight\'s rally will serve as little more than a reminder of the chaos and extremism of today’s Republican Party, and why 81 million Americans rejected Donald Trump in 2020 to elect President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats who have led the fastest economic recovery in history, delivered a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to repair Arizona’s roads and bridges, gotten Americans vaccinated, and helped create over 6 million jobs.”\n\n— Kathy Tulumello\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake began her speech echoing the theme of some of the other speakers, praising America under Trump and listing its problems under Biden. As did others, she called Trump “president” and slammed the 2020 election as “rotten to the core.”\n\nShe vowed to “close every single loophole that allows them to cheat,” though she didn’t give details.\n\nHer wide-ranging comments touched on COVID-19 mandates that she said “people are no longer willing to put up with.”\n\nClaiming she was up “30 points” or more in polls of voters, Lake said, “There will be no mandates and no lockdowns” with her as governor.\n\nShe also called out migrants without papers. “To the people flooding across our border: When I’m governor, you will be arrested and sent back across the border.”\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how she would do that without federal cooperation, but her comments echoed those at a news conference on border security on Tuesday by state lawmakers and Ken Cuccinelli, a former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official under Trump, who claimed that the “self-defense clause” in the U.S. Constitution allows states to take action even without the federal government in times of invasion.\n\n“We are being invaded, and China is pushing deadly fentanyl through Mexico,” said Lake, who then addressed Biden: “It’s going to stop with me &mldr; We do not need your protection, your permission to defend our state.”\n\nShe vowed to finish building Trump’s border wall in Arizona, sparking crowd members to chant, “Build that wall! Build that wall!”\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n6:40 p.m.: Members of Congress, candidates cheer Trump, boo others\n\nThe crowd booed the news media, booed Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and booed election workers. Crowd members may have been Republicans, but they were firmly committed to one man, Donald Trump, and the idea that Biden stole the election from him.\n\nThe politicians who warmed up the crowd for Trump hammered home the points. U.S. House members Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar ripped Biden and exhorted the crowd to get ready for the next elections.\n\n“Can you feel the storm building?” Gosar asked.\n\nAnthony Kern, a former state representative who’s running for state Senate and who was in Washington near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, began yelling, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” as the former president’s helicopter descended to the festival grounds shortly after 5:30 p.m. “Welcome to Arizona, Mr. President!”\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, Kern and 10 other Arizonans, including state GOP Chair Kelli Ward and Rep. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, signed a document that was sent to Congress with a false avowal that they constituted Arizona’s official vote in the Electoral College.\n\nAll 11 people were listed on the general election ballot as the would-be electors for Trump.\n\nBut Trump had lost Arizona. Ducey had certified the election results in late November. By state statute, the only electors who mattered were those pledged to cast their votes for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as they did Dec. 14, 2020, at noon.\n\nThe document the Republicans signed, obtained from the National Archives last year by the group American Oversight, overlooked that detail.\n\nIt described the “undersigned” as the “duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Arizona &mldr;”\n\nReferring to complaints that he and those electors should be criminally charged, Kern said the “real criminals are the ones who stole the election.”\n\nSen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, who’s running for Arizona secretary of state, continued that tack.\n\n“We are so blessed to have Donald Trump with us here today. We know the election was stolen,” Rogers said.\n\n“They attacked Donald Trump because he exposed them and their evil deeds!” Finchem said.\n\n— Ray Stern and Richard Ruelas\n\n6:10 p.m.: State senators continue to claim election fraud\n\nState lawmakers Sen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, and Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, told the crowd to stay committed to the election denial conspiracy, as they would.\n\nBorrelli pushed back on the fact that the belief in widespread election fraud that stole the presidency from Trump in 2020 was a “conspiracy theory.” He said there was indeed a conspiracy, but he claims ""it’s not a theory.”\n\nHe said the problem was “obstructionists” who oversee elections at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office and in Maricopa County.\n\nTownsend and Borrelli were among 30 current and former Arizona lawmakers who signed a resolution asking for the 2020 election to be handed to Trump or for the election certification to be delayed. Borrelli said that many of his peers in the Arizona House and Senate were behind him and other election deniers and that they were going to “tighten up the loopholes that these commie (expletive) have exploited.”\n\nThe crowd cheered as Borrelli claimed that the “shamestream media” were hiding facts like “ghost voters” he says were found to have voted in Pima County in 2020. Pima County election officials deny there were any widespread problems with the election.\n\nTownsend asked how many in the crowd had volunteered for the 2020 election or the Senate-led audit — dozens or more raised their hands. She reminded them that state Attorney General Mark Brnovich is investigating findings from the Senate-led audit and led people in a chant:\n\n“What do we want? Indictments! When do we want them? Now!”\n\nShe referred to unnamed enemies who are “constantly scheming” to steal elections.\n\n“We want indictments of the election workers so that they don’t continue to do this,” she said before going on to condemn “medical tyranny” she sees in COVID-19 emergency measures.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5:30 p.m.: Traffic jams delay Trump fans outside venue\n\nTraffic for the Trump rally was backed up for more than an hour outside Country Thunder in Florence. The line to the front gate snaked back and forth and trailed far into a dirt parking lot as people waited.\n\nBobby Parsons of Cottonwood said he and his wife arrived at 1 p.m. and waited for more than three hours and still hadn\'t made it into the main arena. But he didn\'t mind, not at all.\n\nParsons said he loved the energy of the crowd and couldn\'t wait to see Trump. And if there\'s one message he hopes Trump delivers, it is: ""Tell Biden to get the hell out.""\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n5:15 p.m.: Spending time with \'thousands of people who feel the same way\'\n\nTwo Arizona social workers said their biggest reason for attending the Trump rally is concern for their clients. They said the Biden administration’s handling of the economy has put people who need government services at risk.\n\n“I work for the State of Arizona in the Disability Division, said Colette Lofgren of Apache Junction. “So many people have left their jobs at the state that we cannot get services for people.”\n\nThe ""Great Resignation"" has left the agency with such a backlog that workers are struggling to get to them.\n\nHer friend Sandra Wilson of Mesa nodded in agreement. Wilson works for the Department of Child Safety and said the same issues plague her office.\n\nThe women both said the country’s economic situation, with inflation and supply-chain issues, have taken a personal toll.\n\n“I was getting to the age of retirement,” Lofgren said. “There is no way under this administration that I can move forward with my dreams.”\n\nLofgren said a year ago she was preparing to build a home in Mississippi but abandoned those plans as costs rose.\n\n“There was no way I can build a house,” she said.\n\nBoth women said they want to support President Donald Trump, who is the rightful leader of the country.\n\nWilson said she has attended several Trump rallies and enjoys the camaraderie.\n\n“I can be with good friends and be with thousands and thousands of people who feel the same way,” she said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n4:55 p.m.: Ward: Who won the election? Crowd: Trump\n\nMany — if not most — people in the crowd seemed to believe Trump’s insistence that he really won the election by “a lot.” A year of investigation, numerous courts throwing out lawsuits claiming they had evidence of fraud and the results of the audit authorized by the Arizona Senate did not seem to deter crowd members from their belief.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, who took the stage first, made that clear. She gave a brief speech that began by asking the crowd to respond to the question “Who won the election?”\n\n“Trump!” the crowd roared.\n\nSeeming to address concerns by many Republicans about the election system, Ward urged people to “please, please go out and vote.”\n\nWard claimed that “cheating” also occurred in 2016, but “we overwhelmed their cheating algorithm.”\n\n“Get rid of Dominion! Get rid of drop boxes!” she shouted. “Let’s restore integrity to our election.”\n\nMany of the people in the crowd wore colorful costumes, Trump apparel and shirts supporting Trump or Arizona Republican candidates for office such as gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake or U.S. Senate contender Jim Lamon.\n\nThe crowd included many young people and senior citizens, though most in attendance seemed to be middle-aged. The festival atmosphere included food trucks, loudspeakers blaring a mix of country and classic rock, long lines for the portable toilets and a stage with bleachers for VIPs.\n\nDiehard belief in the falsehood that Trump actually won the 2020 election was a strong theme.\n\nTamera Rayl of Tucson, who was hanging out on a blanket with family members, said she believes Biden won through fraud and hopes Arizona lawmakers “get rid of the machines” used in elections and go back to paper ballots that would be hand-counted.\n\nShe believes like-minded Republicans will still be “mad enough” over the 2020 election results to show up at the polls this year despite beliefs that the election system is broken.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n4:45 p.m.: Speaker lineup includes Lake, 3 members of Congress\n\nBesides Trump, speakers were expected to include several politicians who have spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and supported rioters who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They include:\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley.\n\nState Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa.\n\nState Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff.\n\nKari Lake, candidate for Arizona governor.\n\nAnthony Kern, former state representative and candidate for state Senate.\n\nKelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nAlveda King, 2020 campaign advisory board member.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, Trump strategic adviser and 2020 campaign board member.\n\nMike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow.\n\n“You know what day it is,” a voice said over the loudspeaker at about 4 p.m. “It’s Trump Day! Let’s go, Brandon!”\n\nMany in the crowd responded in kind with the veiled, obscene insult of President Joe Biden.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n3:55 p.m.: Crowd gathers for speeches, rally\n\nThousands of spectators began to gather Saturday afternoon at the Country Thunder festival grounds, with traffic backups on State Route 79. Gates opened at 2 p.m. More than a dozen ATVs lined State Route 79 just before the entrance, waving flags and cheering those lined up in their cars. A single protester stood across from a Mercedes sedan on the entry road to the venue, waving a sign with the United States code on it.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n10:30 a.m.: What\'s on Trump\'s list of talking points?\n\nTrump gave a preview of the Saturday rally that suggests he will continue pushing baseless claims of election fraud.\n\n""Look forward to seeing everyone in Arizona tomorrow! Many topics will be discussed including the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020, the fake Big Lie, the corrupt LameStream Media, the Afghanistan disaster, Inflation, the sudden lack of respect for our Nation and its leaders, and much more,"" Trump said in a written statement Friday. ""Big crowds, will also be covered on TV. See you Saturday evening!""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nDEMOCRACY IN DOUBT: Read the series that gets inside the Arizona election review\n\n9 a.m.: Trump takes a shot at Gov. Ducey\n\nHours before his appearance in Florence, Trump took yet another shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who has become a frequent punching bag for the former president ever since Ducey signed off on the 2020 election results.\n\n“Rumors are that Doug Ducey, the weak RINO Governor from Arizona, is being pushed by Old Crow Mitch McConnell to run for the U.S. Senate,” Trump said in a statement. “He will never have my endorsement or the support of MAGA Nation!”\n\nDucey often bristles at any question about whether he will seek the GOP nomination to challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., for his seat later this year.\n\nBut rumors abound nevertheless, in part thanks to high-ranking Republicans in Washington, D.C., including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who are urging establishment Republicans including Ducey to run.\n\nBut Ducey\'s standard reply includes touting his day job as Arizona’s governor and pointing to early 2021, when he said he was not running for the seat. Asked early last week what his future holds after his final year as governor, Ducey said he was focused on leading the state and running the Republican Governors Association, which seeks to elect Republican governors across the country.\n\n“My plate is full,” Ducey told The Arizona Republic. “And I have found in the past, in my career, when I have focused on the work on my desk and done it with excellence, other opportunities present themselves.”\n\nAsked if Ducey would go to Trump’s rally on Saturday, governor’s spokesman C.J. Karamargin said Ducey had “no plans” to attend.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\nFriday afternoon: ReAwaken America Tour leads to police calls at Dream City Church\n\nA conservative forum in Phoenix overlapping Donald Trump\'s return to Arizona opened Friday with calls to police.\n\nAttendees at the ReAwaken America Tour at Dream City Church taunted teachers from the nearby BASIS Phoenix charter school over masks, school officials confirmed.\n\nThe tour, hosted by conservative podcaster Clay Clark and featuring Trump\'s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, is scheduled to run through Saturday.\n\nElection fraud and pandemic conspiracies dominate the itinerary, including a speech titled, ""It’s the COVID-19 Protocols That Are Mass Murdering COVID-19 Patients.""\n\nOther topics include pinpointing where the world is on the Biblical timeline, communicating after the power grid is destroyed and ""Jesus is King & Donald Trump is the REAL president of the United States.""\n\nArizona Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, state Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, and Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward are among the scheduled speakers.\n\nA pastor at Dream City Church confirmed about a dozen Phoenix police officers responded to the event Friday and the issue had been ""taken care of.""\n\nHe said ReAwaken America rented space from the church but is not affiliated with the church. He said several armed private security guards were hired by the event.\n\nDream City has hosted a number of conservative events, including a June movie premiere touting 2020 election conspiracies by key operatives in the Arizona Senate\'s largely discredited ballot review.\n\nTrump held a rally at the church in 2020.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\nEarly Friday afternoon: Vendors gear up for Trump rally\n\nDays before Donald Trump\'s rally in Florence, merchandise vendors were staking out highway pullouts and setting up roadside stands more than 20 miles away.\n\nVendors dragged tents, tables and Trump gear from the backs of vehicles beginning Wednesday.\n\nFlags and T-shirts fluttered around canopies in at least three spots within a mile of each other Friday on Hunt Highway just over the Maricopa County line in San Tan Valley.\n\nHunt Highway is one of the central routes for people driving from the East Valley to the Country Thunder venue, where Trump is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nPassing cars gave the occasional honk as they zoomed past on Friday, earning waves from vendors.

The witnesses — ranging from many of Trump’s closest aides to law enforcement to some of the rioters themselves — detailed Trump’s actions in the weeks ahead of the insurrection and how his wide-ranging pressure campaign to overturn his defeat directly influenced those who brutally pushed past the police and smashed through the windows and doors of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” reads the report. “None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.”\n\nThe insurrection gravely threatened democracy and “put the lives of American lawmakers at risk,” the nine-member panel concluded.\n\nThe report’s eight chapters of findings tell the story largely as the panel’s hearings did this summer — describing the many facets of the remarkable plan that Trump and his advisers devised to try and void President Joe Biden’s victory. The lawmakers describe his pressure on states, federal officials, lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence to game the system or break the law.\n\nREAD MORE: The Jan. 6 committee says Trump broke these laws. Here’s a guide\n\nTrump’s repeated, false claims of widespread voter fraud resonated with his supporters, the committee said, and were amplified on social media, building on the distrust of government he had fostered for his four years in office. And he did little to stop them when they resorted to violence and stormed the Capitol.\n\nThe massive, damning report comes as Trump is running again for the presidency and also facing multiple federal investigations, including probes of his role in the insurrection and the presence of classified documents at his Florida estate. This week is particularly fraught for him, as a House committee is expected to release his tax returns after he has fought for years to keep them private. And Trump has been blamed by Republicans for a worse-than-expected showing in the midterm elections, leaving him in his most politically vulnerable state since he won the 2016 election.\n\nIt is also a final act for House Democrats who are ceding power to Republicans in less than two weeks, and have spent much of their four years in power investigating Trump. Democrats impeached Trump twice, the second time a week after the insurrection. He was acquitted by the Senate both times. Other Democratic-led probes investigated his finances, his businesses, his foreign ties and his family.\n\nREAD MORE: Jan. 6 committee alleges funds raised by Trump to overturn 2020 election used to sway witness testimonies\n\nOn Monday, the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans officially passed their investigation to the Justice Department, recommending the department investigate the former president on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection. While the criminal referrals have no legal standing, they are a final statement from the committee after its extensive, year-and-a-half-long probe.\n\nTrump has tried to discredit the report, slamming members of the committee as “thugs and scoundrels” as he has continued to falsely dispute his 2020 loss.\n\nIn response to the panel’s criminal referrals, Trump said: “These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me.”\n\nThe committee has also begun to release hundreds of transcripts of its interviews. On Thursday, the panel released transcripts of two closed-door interviews with former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who testified in person at one of the televised hearings over the summer and described in vivid detail Trump’s efforts to influence the election results and indifference toward the violence as it occurred.\n\nIn the two interviews, both conducted after her July appearance at the hearing, she described how many of Trump’s allies, including her lawyer, pressured her not to say too much in her committee interviews.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Farnoush Amiri, Lisa Mascaro, Jill Colvin, Nomaan Merchant and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/january-6-hearing-trump-pressured-justice-undermine-election-rcna34804', 'Headline': ""'Say the election was corrupt': Jan. 6 panel details Trump's DOJ ..."", 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee will present evidence Thursday that former President Donald Trump tried to enlist the Justice Department in his failed bid to overturn the election.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump sought inside help from the Justice Department to execute his campaign to reverse the the 2020 election, according to evidence presented by the House Jan. 6 committee Thursday.\n\n“Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” Trump implored top Justice officials in a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation memorialized in then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue’s contemporaneous notes.\n\nAfter Donoghue and then-Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen repeatedly rebuffed Trump’s pressure, they testified Thursday, he threatened to replace Rosen with Jeff Clark, an inexperienced loyalist who had drafted a letter asserting that the outcome of the election was in doubt and urging states to certify slates of fake electors.\n\nThat letter amounted to a “murder-suicide pact” that would “damage everyone who touches it,” White House counsel Pat Cipollone said during an intense Jan. 3 Oval Office meeting, according to multiple witnesses. In that same discussion, held three days before the official count of electors in Congress, Trump weighed the pros and cons of placing Clark atop the Justice Department to ensure the letter would be sent to pivotal states.\n\nTrump’s treatment of Justice officials represents one piece of an emerging historical record that committee members say proves he orchestrated a sprawling campaign to invalidate his defeat. At the same time he was trying to strong-arm the Justice Department, Trump’s campaign lawyers were pressuring state officials to overturn results and organizing slates of fake electors.\n\nSince the Watergate scandal, most presidents have worked to project a laissez-faire approach to the Justice Department, allowing the agency to operate independently and as apolitically as possible. But throughout his time in office, Trump ignored those norms and sought to treat the agency as his own legal department.\n\n“It was a brazen attempt to use the Justice Department to advance the president’s personal political agenda,” Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday.\n\nDuring the Jan. 3 meeting — just three days before the official certification of electors in Congress — Trump wrestled with whether to make a change at the top of the department.\n\n“What do I have to lose?” he asked.\n\nBut the conversation occurred in a moment in which he was trying to project strength and stability. He was told by advisers that there would be an embarrassing spate of resignations at Justice if he put Clark in charge. Advisers told him Clark — who was in the room — was not competent to run the agency.\n\nTrump relented. Clark was not promoted. The letter was never sent.\n\nBut Trump’s effort to enlist the nation’s top law enforcement officials fits into the committee’s case that he intended to use all available tools — regardless of laws, norms or precedent — to defy voters and cling to power.\n\nClark has become a central figure to the investigation around Jan. 6. Federal agents visited Clark’s home Wednesday, according to a U.S. attorney’s office spokesman. In a statement, Russ Vought, a former Trump administration official and Clark’s employer at the Center for Renewing America, criticized the “raid” as political.\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the panel, led the questioning of three witnesses Thursday: Rosen, Donoghue and former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel.\n\nThe panel has already aired recorded testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said he told Trump in December 2020 that the election was not stolen. Barr, who had said in an interview with The Associated Press that Justice had uncovered no evidence of fraud, resigned before the year was out.\n\nIn its four previous public hearings, the committee presented evidence — through documents and witness testimony — about the physical attack on the Capitol, Trump being advised that he had lost, Trump’s efforts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence and state officials to aid his effort to stop Joe Biden from taking office, and his team’s scheme to replace official electors from seven states with slates of “fake electors.”\n\nAt an earlier hearing, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., promised to name lawmakers who had sought pardons from Trump in the waning days of his presidency. The committee delivered on Thursday, playing recordings of testimony about Rep. Matt Gaetz’s effort to secure a broad pardon from Trump.\n\nA federal grand jury is investigating whether Gaetz, R-Fla., committed any crimes in connection with a sex-trafficking case. He has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.\n\nThe committee also revealed that it had received evidence that several other Republican lawmakers had inquired about getting pardons: Reps. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., asked for a pardon for lawmakers — including himself — who voted against certifying electors, according to testimony.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the hearings are having a significant effect on public opinion about Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection or his fitness for office, but some committee members say they see signs of a shift against the former president.\n\n“There are a lot of folks around the edge, particularly in the Republican Party and elsewhere, that didn’t know the complete story,” Kinzinger told NBC News in an interview. “And now when they see the complete story, they’re really awestruck by it, and how close we got and how brazen this attempt was to change the election.”fspra'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-report-executive-summary-key-findings-trump/', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 committee ...', 'Snippet': 'Jan. 6 panel calls for charges against Trump . ...

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/january-6-transcript-release-latest/index.html', 'Headline': 'Trump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ and other key findings ...', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, on Friday released another wave of witness interview transcripts..

The releases have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – and new details about what key witnesses told the panel.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures:\n\nTrump wanted to trademark ‘Rigged Election!’ days after 2020 election, emails show\n\nThen-President Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase “Rigged Election!” days after Election Day in 2020, according to emails provided by Jared Kushner to the House select committee.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, then-Trump aide Dan Scavino emailed Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with the request from Trump.\n\n“Hey Jared! POTUS wants to trademark/own rights to below, I don’t know who to see – or ask…I don’t know who to take to,” the email from Scavino reads, according to a transcript of Kushner’s testimony to the committee, which was released by the panel on Friday.\n\nTwo phrases were bolded in the email: “Save America PAC!” and “Rigged Election!”\n\nKushner forwarded the request and discussed it on an email chain that included Eric Trump, the president’s son; Alex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer; Sean Dollman, the chief financial officer of Trump’s 2020 campaign; and Justin Clark, a Trump campaign lawyer.\n\n“Guys - can we do ASAP please?” Kushner wrote.\n\nEric Trump responded, saying: “Both web URLs are already registered. Save America PAC was registered October 23 of this year. Was that done by the campaign?”\n\nDollman responded: “‘Save America PAC’ is already taken/registered, just confirming that. But we can still file for ‘Save America.’”\n\nKushner’s response, according to the transcript, was: “Go.”\n\nGiuliani explains Trump team pivot to state legislatures\n\nA feeling that courts weren’t comfortable with Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election drove the Trump team’s pivot to state legislatures, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the select committee earlier this year.\n\nThe theory that the US Constitution lets state legislatures intervene in the presidential election results first came up within the week after the election, Giuliani told congressional investigators. But he and then-fellow Trump attorney Jenna Ellis looked more closely at the idea when the lawsuits challenging the results weren’t getting traction.\n\n“We just got a bad feeling that these judges didn’t – they didn’t want to hear witnesses, citizens, American citizens, and that if American citizens could get up and testify, there were so many of them that it would make a very big difference,” Giuliani said in his May deposition.\n\nThe theory that a state legislature could override the results of a state’s presidential vote is considered a fringe one, and Congress recently enacted statutory changes to limit legislatures’ ability to do so.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani said, “It seemed to me the courts didn’t want to be involved in a political question like this. And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this. And we started reading the Constitution.”\n\nGinni Thomas explains why she was ‘disgusted’ with Pence in text sent days after January 6\n\nVirginia “Ginni” Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the committee that when she said she was “disgusted” with then-Vice President Mike Pence in a text on January 10, 2021, she wasn’t referring to his refusal to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s win, but rather to her frustration with him not talking up election fraud claims. There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n“I was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,” Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. “And I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.”\n\n“I wasn’t focused on the Vice President’s role on January 6th,” she said, when asked specifically if the text – previously reported by CNN – was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n“I can’t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,” she said, pointing instead to what she heard from “friends on the ground” and “grassroots activists” who had “found things suspicious” at polling places.\n\n“I don’t know specific instances,” she said. “But certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.”\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas’ interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court – an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n“He first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,” she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n“I regret the tone and content of these texts … I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,” Thomas said.\n\nThomas’ mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows’ texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n“It was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,” she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “Some of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I’m regretting that they became public … Certainly I didn’t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.”\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her “post-election activities” after Trump lost in 2020 were “minimal and mainstream.”\n\n“Her minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,” attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. “Beyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.”\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn’t recall details, citing ‘fog of war’\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee’s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn’t recall details from January 6, amid what he called “the fog of war” during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day – another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn’t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn’t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n“I’ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn’t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very – a very chaotic day, so I don’t recall those specific details,” Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn’t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato’s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was “shocked” by her testimony.\n\n“I was called to put it on,” Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson’s televised testimony, “and I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, ‘What is she talking about?’”\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump’s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn’t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump’s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato’s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump’s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel’s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n“Many of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don’t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it’s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,” Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to “champion” Trump’s election fraud claims, saying: “Just give me five dead voters.” And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of “what the data actually says.” Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee’s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ’s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she “took it upon” herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by “friends” not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials – including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House. She told the committee that she couldn’t recall having conversations with any of those individuals about DOJ’s investigations into the allegations, and said she shared with them the memo because she thought they would be interested in it.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide said he hadn’t intended to be on ‘team crazy’\n\nRobert Sinners, who worked on the Trump campaign’s Election Day operations in Georgia in 2020 and helped organize the slate of alternate GOP electors there, told congressional investigators that his “intent was never to be aligned with team crazy.”\n\nSinners said he was assured that lawyers had signed off on the alternate elector plan and didn’t realize that numerous lawyers working with the Trump campaign had soured on the electors idea by the time the fake electors were convening on December 14, 2020, according to a transcript released Friday night.\n\nIn hindsight – after more fully understanding the extent of the schemes to overturn the 2020 election and the reservations some Trump attorneys had about these plots – Sinners told investigators he was both “ashamed” to have helped organize the fake electors and “angry.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Sinners emailed the fake electors asking for “complete secrecy and discretion” on December 13, 2020, a day before the GOP electors convened at the Georgia capitol. Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia’s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/us/politics/jan-6-committee-report-legacy.html', 'Headline': 'With Detailed Evidence and a Call for Accountability, Jan. 6 Panel ...', 'Snippet': '“A lot of them expressed that rejection at the ballot box on Nov. 8.” ...

The Jan. 6 panel, led by Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., believes there is enough evidence for the Justice Department to prosecute Trump on four specific charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding — Congress’ certification of electoral votes — and inciting or assisting others in an insurrection.\n\nAmong the committee’s nearly dozen recommendations listed at the end of the report: Urging Congress to create a way to evaluate whether Trump and others who took part in the 2020 election plot should be banned from holding future office.\n\nConsistent with the committee’s series of summer hearings and its executive summary, the full report — divided into eight chapters — largely lays blame for the Jan. 6 attack at the feet of the 45th president and downplays security and intelligence failures.\n\nChapter 1 is titled, ""THE BIG LIE,"" a nod to Trump\'s widespread effort to delegitimize the 2020 election and falsely claim it was stolen, while Chapter 2, titled ""I JUST WANT TO FIND 11,780 VOTES,"" focuses on Trump\'s attempt to pressure state and election officials in Georgia and other places to overturn the election results.\n\nWitnesses, nearly all of them Republicans, testified that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Joe Biden’s legitimate election victory; launched a multi-pronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior members of the Justice Department and then-Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election; directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers’ counting of the electoral votes that would certify the results of the election; and refused to call off his supporters as they brutally assaulted police officers and stormed the Capitol.\n\n""Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television. ... No man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again,"" Cheney said at Monday\'s meeting, a line she repeated in her own foreword. ""He is unfit for any office.""\n\nTrump responded overnight with a series of inflammatory posts to his Truth Social network, repeating many of the same false claims about a stolen election and attacking the committee, the FBI and others.\n\n""The Government of the United States changed our Election Result, and it just doesn’t get any worse than that,"" he wrote Friday, falsely claiming that he was the true winner of the 2020 election. ""Just look at the damage that’s been done to our Country, and the World, in the last two years — It’s incalculable. TRUMP WON!!!""\n\nThe committee’s report alleges that Trump and his inner circle conducted at least 200 public or private acts of “outreach, pressure, or condemnation” targeting state and local election officials, as well as state legislators, to overturn the results between Trump’s loss in November and Jan. 6.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, phone calls or texts aimed at state or local officials; 18 public remarks targeting them; and 125 social media posts, the committee says.\n\nThe report also revealed more details about the fake elector plan, which the committee alleges Trump embraced when it became clear that state officials in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and other key battlegrounds would not overturn the results in their states and replace Biden electors with Trump electors.\n\nWhile the committee referred conservative attorney John Eastman to the Justice Department on Monday for his role in the scheme to pressure Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6, the report identifies Trump-allied lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as central to conceptualizing the plot.\n\nSome of the committee\'s conclusions appear in the report\'s appendices. For example, previous reporting and Jan. 6 hearings had revealed that Pentagon bureaucrats, including Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt and Gen. Charles Flynn, had delayed sending National Guard troops as police were overwhelmed by the rioters.\n\nBut the committee found that there was no deliberate attempt to stall the troops: “While the delay seems unnecessary and unacceptable, it was the byproduct of military processes, institutional caution, and a revised deployment approval process,"" the committee writes in Appendix 2.\n\n""We have no evidence that the delay was intentional.”\n\nAs it was tasked to do, the committee also issued a number of recommendations to both Congress and federal agencies. The panel urged congressional committees to consider creating a “formal mechanism” to determine whether to bar Trump and others identified in the report from holding future federal or state office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which targets those who have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee also called for reforms to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to make it clear that the vice president does not have the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes, an update that is already in the works. Congress will pass such a recommendation this week as part of its omnibus spending package.\n\nIn addition, the Jan. 6 committee recommended that federal agencies undertake a “whole of government strategy” to root out and combat violent extremism, including white nationalists. And it urged law enforcement to designate future certifications of presidential elections as a “national special security event.” That would require greater planning, coordination and security for future Jan. 6 certification events at the Capitol.\n\n""Driven by our investigative findings, these recommendations will help strengthen the guardrails of our democracy,"" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe report marks the culmination of a sweeping congressional investigation that included 11 public hearings, more than 100 subpoenas, more than 1,200 witness interviews and the collection of hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails and other documents.\n\nThe committee has already begun releasing dozens of transcripts from witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights, including Trump associates Eastman, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and Jeffrey Clark.\n\nOn Thursday, the Jan. 6 panel released transcripts of the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who had testified that Trump was aware the mob was armed when he sent it to the Capitol and that he had tried to join his supporters there.\n\nIn the coming days, the committee also plans to release other transcripts from interviews and depositions, as well as video and other documents and records.\n\nBecause House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., created it as a ""select"" committee, the panel expires at the end of the year. Republicans, who will take control of the House in January, have no plans to renew it.\n\nAt her final news conference as speaker Thursday, Pelosi praised Thompson, Cheney and the other Jan. 6 members for their ""persistent, patriotic leadership.""\n\n""The 117th Congress began with a violent assault on our democracy, and now we hear its conclusions,"" she said. ""We have a vital road map ensuring justice will be done ... and that this won’t happen again.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112324462/jan-6-hearing-takeaways', 'Headline': ""Trump didn't act and didn't want to, plus 4 other takeaways from Jan. 6 ..."", 'Snippet': ""House Jan. 6 committee hearings Jan. 6 panel sheds light on the 187 minutes Trump went dark during Capitol siege ... Donald Trump's conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of this oath of office ..."", 'Full_text': 'In the early evening of Jan. 6, after former President Donald Trump finally and reluctantly put out a video telling rioters to go home, after hours of staffers urging him to do so, he had only one thing to say.\n\n""Mike Pence let me down,"" Trump told a staffer of his vice president.\n\nThat was revealed during prime time on Thursday by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., in the last of the first series of Jan. 6 committee hearings.\n\nJan. 6, 2021, was the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol since British soldiers burned it in 1814. People died. Members of Congress ran for their lives. Gallows were erected for Pence. Secret Service agents scrambled and said last goodbyes.\n\nAnd that was it — ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nThis was an attack that didn\'t come from outside; it came from within, from a mob of supporters of the defeated former president who pulled the wool over their eyes and convinced them — with lies — that it had all been stolen.\n\nThe committee, across these eight hearings, has built a case — more political than legal — that Trump, who continues to lie about the election and teases that he will run again in 2024, is not fit to hold the office.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the hearings thus far:\n\n1. Trump declined to tell rioters to go home for hours despite being urged to do so — and that had consequences.\n\nThe committee already laid out that Trump was aware there were many in the crowd who had weapons, but he wanted them to be allowed to bypass metal detectors and be allowed into his speech at the Ellipse. He somehow was confident they weren\'t there to hurt him.\n\nLikewise, he was aware that his supporters could become violent and was aware in real time that they were becoming violent. He watched on TV as it all went down. As things got worse, and staffer after staffer urged him to make a statement or put out a tweet that the crowd go home, he declined to do so until hours later.\n\nIn fact, when he finally did, when it happened to be clear that the insurrection would fail, he empathized with them.\n\nThat was the last straw for Sarah Matthews, a former deputy press secretary who testified Thursday.\n\n""He didn\'t distinguish between those who peacefully attended his speech and those we watched cause violence,"" Matthews said, adding, ""As a spokesperson, I knew I would be asked to defend that. His refusal to act and call off the mob that day, his refusal to condemn the violence was indefensible.""\n\nShe resigned that night.\n\nEven the next day, in outtakes of his videotaped speech to supporters, Trump was editing on the fly, and insisted: ""I don\'t want to say the election\'s over.""\n\nThe bottom line is Trump knew what was going on, and could have taken action, but chose not to, for hours. It was three hours and seven minutes from the end of his speech to when he finally put out the video telling the rioters to go home.\n\nAnd that had consequences — violence and damage to people and the building, but also to America\'s reputation around the world, testified Matthew Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser in the Trump White House.\n\nJan. 6, he said, ""emboldened our enemies by helping give them ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn\'t work, that the United States is in decline.""\n\n2. A political argument more than a legal one.\n\nThe committee has made a strong case that Trump inspired Jan. 6. A number of those facing charges for their role that day have pointed the finger at the president, too.\n\nWhether there\'s any hard, prosecutable evidence of Trump\'s intent and coordination is less clear. It\'s been somewhat surprising how few firsthand conversations with Trump we\'ve heard about in these hearings with this many witnesses so close to the former president.\n\nBut Trump\'s criminal culpability, if any, is for the Department of Justice to determine.\n\nIt\'s becoming clearer after several of these hearings that the committee\'s goal is less legal and more political.\n\nTrump still won\'t acknowledge the truth that he lost the 2020 election. He\'s instead using his false grievance-filled election lies as fuel for a potential 2024 run. And that seems to be the key thing this committee is trying to prevent — Trump holding office again.\n\n""Every American must consider this,"" committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said, ""can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of Jan. 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?""\n\nAre they convincing people? Perhaps, to a degree. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, out Thursday, found that hardcore partisans are pretty locked in — and Republicans are mostly not paying attention.\n\nBut it did also show that a majority of independents now blame Trump for what happened Jan. 6 (57%) and describe Jan. 6 as an insurrection and threat to democracy (52%). Both are up 9 points since last December. That\'s notable, given independents make up a good deal of the dwindling share of swing voters left in this country.\n\n3. It\'s hard to dismiss these witnesses.\n\nWe\'ve said it before, but we\'ll say it again, it gets harder and harder for Trump loyalists to dismiss these witnesses as Republicans in Name Only, or RINOs, with an ax to grind.\n\nThese have been people who worked for Trump\'s campaigns, his White House and voted for him. And there have been many of them.\n\nCheney attempted to reframe what\'s being said not as testimony but as a ""series of confessions"" from people close to the former president.\n\n""The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political enemies,"" Cheney noted. ""It is instead a series of confessions by Donald Trump\'s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials — his own family.""\n\nTrump has a history of turning up the pressure. Cheney has warned against potential witness intimidation, but it\'s been clear that no one has been immune from Trump\'s pressure campaigns — not his vice president, not Secret Service agents, not state officials or local election workers.\n\nHe\'s not even beyond manipulating his own supporters — for their time, action or money – as the committee has shown.\n\n4. For members of the committee, this has, at times, felt personal.\n\nOthers on the committee, though, seem eager to grind their axes. Those blades seem sharpest for members of their own party, and Kinzinger has often had his hand on the handle.\n\n""I\'m glad I\'m leaving here in a year, because I\'m just being surrounded by a bunch of children,"" Kinzinger said back in April. ""I hope my party can finally remember where our foundations are.""\n\nKinzinger, who is retiring at the end of his congressional term, has been ostracized by members of his own party — and family — and targeted by the former president. At times, he has channeled that anger into these hearings.\n\n""Whatever your politics,"" he said Thursday, ""whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of this oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation. It is a stain on our history, it is a dishonor to all those who have sacrificed and died in service to our democracy, when we present our full findings we will recommend changes to laws and policies to guard against another Jan. 6.""\n\nThis committee has revealed in prior sessions that a number of Republican colleagues have sought pardons.\n\nAnd then in Thursday\'s session, Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., highlighted a video of Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley running through the halls to evacuate, after previously raising a fist to the crowd in solidarity.\n\n""Think about what we\'ve seen,"" Luria said. ""Undeniable violence at the Capitol. The vice president being evacuated to safety by the Secret Service. Senators running through the hallways of the Senate to get away from the mob.""\n\nThen she tied it back to the larger point: ""As the commander in chief, President Trump was oath- and duty-bound to protect the Capitol. His senior staff understood that.""\n\n5. This is not the last hearing.\n\nCall it just the end of season one, because Cheney left us with this cliffhanger.\n\n""In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward,"" she said, adding, ""Doors have opened. New subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break.""\n\nNetflix never turns seasons around that quickly.\n\n""We have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people and more to gather,"" Cheney said. ""So our committee will spend August pursuing emerging information on multiple fronts before convening further hearings this September.""\n\nThat means the committee\'s hearings will be getting closer to the November elections — something it originally wanted to steer clear of.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145170803/the-final-report-on-the-capitol-attack-is-released-by-the-house-jan-6-panel', 'Headline': 'The final report on the Capitol attack is released by the House Jan. 6 ...', 'Snippet': ""The 800-page report details why the panel recommended four criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump. The report comes after the panel's final business hearing on Monday."", 'Full_text': 'LEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThe House Select January 6 Committee has released its final report. It comes after an 18-month investigation into the events which culminated in the insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. In more than 800 pages, the report details what led the panel to vote to issue four criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump, among other recommendations. And it lays out a path forward for the panel\'s findings. Here\'s Chairman Bennie Thompson.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON: We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\'ve provided to aid in their work.\n\nFADEL: To walk us through all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.\n\nCLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: Good morning. So what are some of the report\'s major findings?\n\nGRISALES: It focuses largely on former President Trump\'s premeditated role in the January 6 attack and goes further into his criminal referrals from the committee. The report is eight chapters long covering false claims of a stolen election, the fake elector scheme, and, quote, ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" referencing Trump\'s inaction during the siege. One chapter is titled after a federal judge\'s description of Trump\'s post-2020 election efforts, calling it a, quote, ""coup in search of a legal theory"" and captures desperate attempts to overturn the presidential result, such as trying to force then-Vice President Mike Pence to illegally reverse President Biden\'s win in a ceremonial counting of the vote. Finally, it details ties between extremist groups and Trump allies.\n\nFADEL: So how does the report delve into law enforcement and intelligence failures?\n\nGRISALES: It reiterates other findings that there were significant failures here. For example, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, said before January 6, the probability for violence was clear. And he expected, quote, ""street fights when the sun went down.""\n\nFADEL: What role does the American public play when it comes to these findings?\n\nGRISALES: The panel says while the danger to the Capitol by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that a president would be the catalyst was unprecedented. The report says, quote, ""If we lack the imagination that a president would incite an attack on his own government,"" it goes on to say, ""we lack that insight no more."" And it says the best defense against that danger in the future will not come from law enforcement but rather an informed and active citizenry.\n\nFADEL: OK. So what recommendations does the report lay out?\n\nGRISALES: The first is reforms to the Electoral Count Act. This would solidify a vice president\'s role as ceremonial. And this is part of a major spending bill that could head to President Biden\'s desk today. It also says it\'s now up to the Justice Department and courts to take the lead on criminal referrals and that respective legal bar associations should evaluate the conduct of attorneys named in the report, who should not, quote, ""undermine the constitutional and statutory process for peacefully transferring power in our government."" This includes attorney John Eastman, who was tied to the plot to overturn the result, Kenneth Chesebro, a central figure in the fake elector scheme, and other Trump-aligned attorneys such as Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFADEL: OK. So, Claudia, now that this investigation is done, the report is out. What are the next steps?\n\nGRISALES: There are still more records to come and plenty. For example, a few dozen witness transcripts have been shared so far by the panel, but hundreds more are expected in the coming days as the panel will sunset December 31.\n\nFADEL: NPR\'s Claudia Grisales, thank you so much.\n\nGRISALES: Thank you much.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

Panel members now seem to be trying to lure Trump’s former White House counsel Pat ...', 'Full_text': ""The House Jan. 6 committee continued to hammer its main theme on Tuesday: Lacking a credible reason to overturn the election, Donald Trump and his allies sought to shame, bully and coerce state officials into manufacturing the victory the voters had denied him.\n\nBut in its latest hearing, the committee offered a new perspective. In his zeal to retain power, Trump and his allies trampled largely defenseless people who had the misfortune of getting in their way.\n\nIf not for the backbone they showed, Trump might have succeeded in subverting the nation’s democratic traditions.\n\nDefying Trump came at great personal cost. In emotional testimony, witnesses described the anguish they suffered from a Trump pressure campaign that has left them shaken to this day. Convinced that the election was stolen, Trump supporters demonized and threatened election officials and low-level workers who had merely tallied and reported accurate results.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing:\n\nTrump and company steamrolled innocent people to get a second term\n\nOne of the falsehoods peddled after the election was that election workers in Georgia had plucked fraudulent ballots from “suitcases,” giving Joe Biden the votes to win the state. The story was thoroughly debunked. Multiple recounts showed that Biden indeed won the state, while the “suitcases” were actually carriers that are routinely used in storing ballots.\n\nThe committee aired a clip of Rudy Giuliani, a former adviser to Trump, appearing before a Georgia legislative committee and alleging that a mother-daughter pair of election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, had “surreptitiously” passed around USB devices “as if they’re vials of heroin or cocaine.”\n\nTrump mentioned them in the famous phone call in which he asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes needed to defeat Biden. He called the mother, Freeman, a “professional vote scammer” and a “hustler.”\n\nIn testimony, Moss described how people came into her grandmother’s house looking to find her and her mother and trying to make a “citizen's arrest.”\n\n“I felt so helpless and horrible for her,” Moss recalled. “She was screaming. I told her to close the door and don’t open the door for anyone.”\n\nThe workers had done nothing wrong, as subsequent investigations showed. The USB device that Giuliani mentioned? Moss said her mother was handing her “a ginger mint.”\n\nAfter the hearing, committee members left the dais and one by one lined up to thank and hug Moss and Freeman.\n\nGiuliani appears again and again in the drive to overturn the results\n\nThe former New York City mayor played an outsize role in trying to keep Trump in office, as the hearings have revealed. Giuliani pressed Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers to convene a meeting of the state legislature to consider allegations of election fraud. Bowers was reluctant to do it, not wanting to be “a pawn” in the fight over the election, he testified. He repeatedly asked Giuliani and Trump for evidence that the election was stolen — of names of people who had voted illegally.\n\nHe described a meeting with Giuliani and one of his associates, Jenna Ellis, in which he asked them for proof of wrongdoing. Neither provided any. Giuliani, he said, told him: “We have lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nThe committee has the goods\n\nOne question before the hearings began was whether all the press leaks surrounding Jan. 6 would undercut the committee’s work. The committee faced a risk that viewers might tune out, feeling they’ve heard it all before. But the committee continues to present fresh testimony that deepens the public’s understanding of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAt times, the new disclosures are small, but telling. In Tuesday’s hearing, the committee played snippets of Giuliani’s voicemail messages to state lawmakers asking them to return his calls and discuss the election. One official, Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler, tried to get Giuliani to stop phoning. “I understand you don’t want to talk to me now, but I just want to bring some facts to your attention,” Giuliani said in one recording.\n\nMark Meadows, Trump’s fourth and final chief of staff, wanted to send memorabilia to Georgia state employees in an office that was auditing the election results, committee member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., disclosed at the hearing. Text messages showed that Meadows had wanted to send investigators in the office items that included autographed MAGA hats. White House staff prevented that from taking place.\n\nCommittee ups pressure on Trump former counsel Cipollone\n\nThe Jan. 6 panel has heaped praise on those Republicans who stood up to Trump and have testified publicly. Panel members now seem to be trying to lure Trump’s former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to join them at a hearing.\n\nAs she closed Tuesday’s session, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called on Cipollone to reverse course and share his story before the committee.\n\n“Our evidence shows that Pat Cipollone and his office tried to do what was right. They tried to stop a number of President Trump’s plans for Jan. 6,” Cheney said. “We think the American people deserve to hear from Mr. Cipollone personally. He should appear before this committee, and we are working to secure his testimony.”\n\nCipollone and his deputy, Patrick Philbin, informally met with the committee in April. The panel wants Cipollone to testify publicly because he reportedly objected to Trump’s plan to fire acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, who supported the president’s bid for the Justice Department to pursue false claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nBut it’s unclear if Cheney’s challenge will have any effect: A person close to Cipollone said, “Pat has been cooperative with the committee with President Trump’s permission, but there are serious institutional concerns and privilege issues and those have been recognized by the committee.”""}}",97.5,1

The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-firebrands-matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-accuse-two-cities-deep-blue-state-free-speech-rights', 'Headline': 'House GOP firebrands accuse 2 cities in deep-blue state of ... - Fox News', 'Snippet': 'Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz tape an episode of Gaetz\'s ""Firebrand"" podcast in Gaetz\'s Washington office Shuran Huang for TIME By Molly Ball June 14, 2022 6:00 AM EDT', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/4/23669635/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-protest', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene’s protest for Trump is a zany flop - Vox', 'Snippet': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day.', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan6-committee-hearing-maga-capitol-attack-1386078/', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Committee Hearing to Showcase Pro-Trump Lawmakers Fleeing Mob', 'Snippet': 'Republicans like Reps.

Editor’s ...', 'Full_text': 'The Jan. 6 committee plans to use its Thursday-night hearing to call out insurrection-friendly lawmakers who cowered during the Capitol attack but have since downplayed the insurrection’s severity, according to two sources familiar with the committee’s planning.\n\n“They have plans to paint a really striking picture of how some of Trump’s greatest enablers of his coup plot were — no matter what they’re saying today — quaking in their boots and doing everything shy of crying out for their moms,” one source tells Rolling Stone. “If any of [these lawmakers] were capable of shame, they would be humiliated.”\n\nThroughout its hearings, the committee has made extensive use of photo and video evidence, including, at times, footage of lawmakers reacting to a mob of Donald Trump supporters who fought through a police line to break into the Capitol.\n\nThe committee has at times switched plans at the last minute, and it remains unclear which specific lawmakers the committee could call out. But at least some Republicans have already had their attempts to downplay or justify the attempted coup undone by footage from the day of the attack. When Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) claimed the insurrection “a normal tourist visit,” social media users quickly located photos of the Georgia Republican gasping in terror and hiding behind an armed Capitol police officer pointing a handgun at a barricaded entrance to the Senate floor.\n\nIn the 18 months since the insurrection, Republican lawmakers have tried to whitewash it through a series of contradictory talking points. Republicans have alternately downplayed the attack by calling it “a peaceful protest,” claimed it was violent but that the violence was carried out solely by nonexistent “antifa” or federal informants at the Capitol, or that Democrats were to blame for failing to adequately defend the Capitol against the protesters they variously claim weren’t violent or a threat.\n\nRepublicans like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Paul Gosar have gone so far as to cast alleged rioters held in pretrial detention as unjustly accused political prisoners.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe bulk of the Thursday-night hearing is expected to focus on Trump’s actions during the insurrection, including whether he took any action to defuse the riot at a time when lawmakers were under attack. But using photos and footage to slap down MAGA lawmakers’ claims of a “tourist visit” from “peaceful patriots” is part of a broader effort to bring reality to bear on a fictitious, pro-Trump reimagining of Jan. 6.\n\nThat mythology, peddled widely in conservative media, claims Trump and his allies planned a peaceful rally to highlight credible reports of systemic election fraud, exercising their First Amendment rights in an effort to protect democracy. In that warped telling, the peaceful demonstrations were hijacked by a small number of violent extremists with no connection to Trump or his team. And, as the lie goes, Democrats have since wildly overstated the violence as a political ploy.\n\nThrough interviews with more than 1,000 individuals and reviews of more than 125,000 records, the Jan. 6 committee has debunked every part of that narrative. Instead, the committee has demonstrated that Trump attempted to steal an election he was repeatedly told he’d lost. And that his efforts to steal it included directing a wildly unconstitutional phony-electors scheme — and priming his supporters for a Capitol attack.\n\nAs Trump spoke at his preplanned rally near the White House, he called for a march on the U.S. Capitol, bolstering a crowd of people who violently clashed with law enforcement. Testimony given to the committee indicated that Trump and members of the administration were aware of the potential for violence, and witnesses have alleged that Trump went so far as to ask for security at his Ellipse rally to be loosened so armed individuals could enter the crowd. Trump’s team has attempted to distance itself from any of the Capitol events, but the committee has revealed that the former president’s call for his supporters’ march was premeditated.\n\nThe committee obtained a draft of an unsent tweet in which Trump teased a march to the Capitol following his speech at the Ellipse. “I will be making a Big Speech at 10 a.m. on January 6th at the Ellipse (South of the White House),” read the draft tweet, preserved by the National Archives. “Please arrive early, massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the steal!”\n\nRelated Content\n\nThe committee also displayed a text exchange on Jan. 4 between White House Ellipse rally organizer Kylie Kremer and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, in which the pair discussed a secret plan to have Trump call for protesters to march to a second location, either the Supreme Court or Capitol, on Jan. 6. In the exchange Kremer urged Lindell to keep the plans secret, since they did not have permits for the march.\n\nA second text message, from Ali Alexander, written on Jan. 5 outlined that plan for the next day. “Tomorrow: Ellipse then US Capitol. Trump is supposed to order us to capitol at the end of his speech but we will see.”\n\nRolling Stone this spring reported that top Trump officials held a phone call with Kremer during which they actively planned for the march.\n\nTrump’s team has also sought to portray Trump as opposed to the Capitol violence, but the committee revealed he actively resisted efforts to quell the violence — including by refusing to call the actions “illegal” when prompted to do so.\n\nIn her bombshell testimony before the committee, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson revealed that she had drafted a statement for President Trump asking protesters who had entered the Capitol “illegally” to leave. According to Hutchinson, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows took the draft statement to Trump, who scratched out the word “illegally” and refused to issue it. Hutchinson was told there would be no “further action on that statement.”\n\nStephanie Grisham, former chief of staff and press secretary to First Lady Melania Trump, later tweeted out a screenshot of a text exchange between her and the first lady on Jan. 6, in which Melania refused to issue a statement condemning “lawlessness and violence” by protesters. Grisham resigned from her position later that day.\n\nIndeed, Trump has since continually considered ways to lessen the legal consequences for the Capitol rioters. Hutchinson also revealed that Trump wanted to include language in his Jan. 7 speech about pardoning his supporters who stormed the Capitol, and that Meadows agreed with the inclusion of such language. According to previous testimony given by Hutchinson, the pardon offer was ultimately removed from the speech on the advice of the White House counsel’s office.\n\nThe possibility of pardons has remained in the president’s mind since he left office. At a January rally in Houston, he told supporters, “If I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.”\n\nThe Jan. 6 insurrection was the highest-profile part of a broader effort to steal the 2020 election, but it was far from the only way Trump and his team tried to overturn the results. The committee has revealed that Trump took a “direct and personal role” in efforts to pressure states to change their results or appoint phony electors who’d contravene voters by throwing their support to Trump.\n\nIn the committee’s fourth hearing, lawmakers described Trump pressuring individual state legislators to go back into session and declare him the true winner of the 2020 election. Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, was told by the former president to “find” the votes necessary to give him the state.\n\nA separate scheme was concocted by Trump lawyer John Eastman to send two slates of alternate electors, declaring Trump the winner, to the congressional certification of the Electoral College vote and having Vice President Pence use the false electors in the vote. Eastman knew the scheme was illegal, and admitted so in front of Trump days before the Electoral College certification. The committee revealed on June 21 that this scheme culminated in an attempt by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to deliver the fake electors to Pence on Jan. 6.\n\nNone of this was in response to credible information about systemic election fraud, and Trump knew that — or at least he would have, had he listened to multiple high-level members of his administration.\n\nDuring its first hearing, the committee played recorded testimony from Trump’s former attorney general, Bill Barr. In his testimony, Barr told the committee that he had been clear with the former president that his claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him were “bullshit.” Barr would go on to testify that attempts by him and other advisers to convince Trump that the 2020 election was legitimate were futile, and described Trump as being “detached from reality.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City ... - CBS News', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

This is not your fault. Or [Capitol Police chief Steven] Sund’s fault.”\n\nThe Republicans responsible for the withering report — Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Troy Nehls (R-TX) — are the five congressmen originally nominated to sit on the Jan. 6 committee, until Pelosi vetoed Banks and Jordan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the rest of his nominees in protest. Pelosi then installed two Never Trump Republican outcasts, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nGiven Pelosi’s assiduous grooming of Cheney, no doubt it suited both their interests to focus the final Jan.6 committee report on Trump — and not on Pelosi’s culpability.\n\nBut now the Republicans Pelosi rejected have skewered her in their rival report, dredging up some of what she tried to hide, despite complaining of obstruction from the personnel she controls.\n\nThe report insinuates that the Speaker left the Capitol Police without backup on Jan. 6 because “widespread concern from Democratic leadership over ‘optics’ in the aftermath of the Summer 2020 ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard.”\n\nChief Sund begged repeatedly for troops but has testified that Irving rebuffed him over concern about “optics.” During the violence on Jan. 6, Sund repeated his request, but help was delayed until after the riot ended, because Irving needed to run it up the chain of command, a.k.a. Pelosi.\n\n“The Speaker’s office was heavily involved in planning and decision-making before and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and micromanaged the Sergeant at Arms.”\n\nFrom early December 2020, Pelosi aides attended regular meetings with Irving and Sund to discuss the security plan. So hands-on was Pelosi’s chief of staff Terri McCullough that, at one point, she was editing details of parking, event timing and “language regarding official business visitors” for the Joint Session.\n\nTo illustrate the intense involvement of Pelosi’s office, on Jan. 6 alone, the report records 36 communications between Irving and Pelosi staffers, including 11 with McCullough, and 20 with Jamie Fleet, a Pelosi aide who doubled as a Democratic staff director.\n\nPelosi’s repeated assertions that she has “no power over the Capitol Police” are rejected.\n\n“This is false,” says the report. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff . . .\n\n“House Rules dictate . . . that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”\n\nIndeed, the report says that Pelosi regularly exercised her authority over security matters, “when she directed the use of magnetometers outside the House chamber in the name of safety . . . Similarly, she required masks in the House chamber [and] exerted influence on security protocols at the Capitol related to the perimeter fence . . . She also oversaw the fencing that was erected for a purported rally on September 18, 2021, that never materialized.”\n\nThe report of the Republican refuseniks is an appetizer to potential future investigations next year when they regain subpoena power. It makes sensible recommendations to prevent another disaster, including reform and oversight of the Capitol Police Board.\n\nFar from being a revenge ploy, it identifies security flaws it claims have not been remedied, including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and hopelessly outnumbered when “criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with … the Joint Session of Congress.”\n\nThe Capitol Police Intelligence Division “failed to warn USCP leadership and line officers about the threat of violence,” despite having “obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence.”\n\nIn fact, the final intelligence threat assessment three days before the riot did warn of a violent scenario in which “Congress itself” could be attacked by armed Trump supporters. But the warning was buried towards the end of the 15-page document and was not included in the up-front summary, so was overlooked. Nor was the warning mentioned in three subsequent daily intelligence reports.\n\nThe Republicans blame much of the intelligence failure on the assistant director of the USCP intelligence division, Julie Farnam, who had joined the Capitol Police from the Department of Homeland Security only 10 weeks before the riot.\n\nAnalysts testified that “the section became ‘nonfunctional’ immediately upon Farnam’s arrival as she tried to “consolidate power for herself to the detriment of the safety and security of the Capitol.”\n\n“Documents and testimony show that, immediately upon joining the USCP, and without time to acclimate, Farnam began to dismantle the systems that had kept the Capitol safe for so long,” the report alleges.\n\n“Information about planned protests and threats of violence were siloed and not properly analyzed and disseminated during this key period because of Farnam’s misplaced priorities.”\n\nOne analyst testified: “at the time of January 6, we were not doing proactive searches of social media like we had been before. We were strictly reactive.”\n\nAs a result, USCP leadership “were not fully informed about the severity of the threats against the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021”.\n\nHowever, Farnam told CBS this year that her team does not bear any responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and provided adequate threat assessments to police leadership before the riot.\n\n“I think we did an excellent job . . . I am the one who has worked tirelessly . . . to right this ship.”\n\nAfter cataloguing so many tragic failures, the report concludes on a poignant note with messages to Irving from friends in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.\n\n“You’re quite something to take this one for the team, Paul, as they say. I know how these things work and you know I do, too.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32LN3YT', 'Headline': 'Nancy Pelosi footage revives false January 6 claims, conspiracy ...', 'Snippet': 'Social media users claim House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""staged"" the January 6, 2021 attack at the US Capitol by rejecting security assistance and hiring a camera crew working with her daughter, a documentary filmmaker, to record her response as the violence played out.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/j6-committee-failed-to-preserve-records-has-no-data-on-capitol-hill-security-failures-gop-charges', 'Headline': 'J6 Committee failed to preserve records, has no data on Capitol Hill ...', 'Snippet': 'The GOP head of the committee investigating the security failures of January 6 says the Nancy Pelosi-created committee did not preserve the documents as it was required.', 'Full_text': 'FIRST ON FOX: The House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 failed to adequately preserve documents, data and video depositions – including communications it had with the Biden White House that are still missing – according to the Republican lawmaker overseeing the GOP investigation into the committee\'s work.\n\nThe now-disbanded ""J6"" committee, which was run by Democrats and included only two GOP members, has also failed to provide any evidence that it looked into Capitol Hill security failures on the day of the riot, Rep.

Accordingly, and contrary to your letter’s implication, the Select Committee was not obligated to archive all video recordings of transcribed interviews or depositions. Based on guidance from House authorities, the Select Committee determined that the written transcripts provided by nonpartisan, professional official reporters, which the witnesses and Select Committee staff had the opportunity to review for errata, were the official, permanent records of transcribed interviews and depositions for the purposes of rule VII.""\n\n""He\'s saying they decided they didn\'t have to,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol.

Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said while introducing the footage. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing — what he simply refused to do.”""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/security-failures-january-6-committee-blue-team/index.html', 'Headline': 'January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Davis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing ...', 'Full_text': 'More than 80 officials from law enforcement and federal agencies have testified to the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, including members of the Secret Service, in what investigators believe will be the most extensive review yet of security failures that led to the US Capitol breach.\n\nThe House select committee’s so-called “blue team” is focused on understanding the threats leading up to attack, how intelligence was shared among law enforcement and their preparations. In addition to depositions, the team has thousands of documents from more than a dozen agencies that other security reviews didn’t have, two committee aides tell CNN.\n\nWhile much of what the Democrat-led committee has made public so far has centered around the plotting by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election, aides and lawmakers say this behind-the-scenes review might lead to the bulk of their legislative recommendations and have the most lasting impact.\n\n“We really need to bear down on those things that we think need to be done from strengthening the windows, so they’re unbreakable, all the way up to potential reforms of the electoral count act and protection of the right to vote,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee. “We need to spend some real time talking about the policy recommendations and dimension of this.”\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have launched their own investigation into security lapses on January 6, 2021, and plan to release recommendations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP lawmakers involved in the effort have made clear they will focus, at least in part, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role.\n\n“The reports that come out of the select committee are based upon anything that’s anti-President Trump,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican who has used his position as the ranking member on the House Administration Committee to look into security issues.\n\nThe competing investigations underscore that January 6 remains a polarizing issue – turning even typically nonpartisan issues like security into partisan flash points – and that questions remain about how breakdowns happened and what improvements can be made to ensure such an attack never happens again.\n\nSecurity lapses scrutinized\n\nOver the past year, several reviews have examined various aspects of law enforcement failures, but some ran into challenges collecting information and none has been able to fully assess the federal, local and congressional response as a whole.\n\nFor example, congressional aides who worked on a Senate report released in June said that federal law enforcement agencies didn’t provide all of the information investigators requested. And the Capitol Police inspector general produced several reports but noted investigators spoke to about 35 officers, despite efforts to interview dozens more.\n\nThe inspectors general from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security also plan to produce reports on their findings.\n\nThe House select committee’s blue team review is much broader than previous ones, aides say.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of more information that we have, that the Senate report did not have or any of the IG reports do not have in terms of the amount of interviews we’ve conducted,” one of the aides told CNN.\n\nThe committee’s sweeping probe includes several investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The green team, for example, is tasked with tracking money, including the funding behind the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the attack. In all, they have interviewed more than 750 people and subpoenaed thousands of records.\n\nIn contrast to the work of other teams, some of whom have had to confront recalcitrant witnesses and lawsuits seeking to block their subpoenas, the aide said witnesses for the blue team have been cooperative – and largely content to stay out of the public eye.\n\n“I don’t have folks storming out of my (depositions) and then going to the press,” the aide said.\n\n“It’s just it’s people who are genuinely concerned about what happened and want to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nAides say the witnesses have included current and former law enforcement officials, from first responders to high-ranking officers, and from the Secret Service, which has publicly revealed little about their operations that day.\n\nThe team expects to propose legislative fixes as well as administrative changes related to law enforcement and physical security at the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the committee, told CNN those proposals could address streamlining the process by which the Capitol Police chief gets approval to call on the National Guard, which led to issues on January 6, and how intelligence-gathering and information-sharing happens across various agencies. As chair of the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Police, Lofgren has already spearheaded efforts to improve Capitol security.\n\n“Along with the entire investigation, we want to know everything that led up to and on the day of the 6th,” Lofgren said. “Now, part of that obviously is the law enforcement preparation for January 6, how they responded to the riot as it was happening, the shortcomings, and what recommendations we want to improve the situation in the future.”\n\nGOP investigation\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, McCarthy pledged last year that Republicans would pursue their own “investigation of the facts” after Pelosi rejected his picks to sit on the House Select Committee. Since then, two of the three Republicans vetoed by Pelosi have quietly undertaken the task.\n\nDavis and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana have teamed up to informally investigate security failures. No Republican member can subpoena witness testimony or documents without the help of Democrats, so any information they have collected has been through voluntary cooperation.\n\nDavis declined to specify who he and his fellow Republicans have interviewed or what documents they’ve collected but noted several whistleblowers have come forward through a website his committee launched in the months following the riot. Davis said he doesn’t have faith the House select committee will dig deeply enough.\n\n“I don’t think enough focus is going to be placed upon the failures of the security apparatus pre-January 6 that needs to be investigated,” Davis said, recalling that he got a security briefing from Capitol Police on January 5 in his office. “There was nothing in that briefing that would have led me to believe that I would have witnessed what I saw on January 6.”\n\nTwo sources close to the GOP investigation say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including rank-and-file law enforcement and top brass. Their report may be timed to coincide with the House Select Committee’s public hearings, the sources said – illustrating that they see their investigative effort as a counterweight to the committee’s work.\n\nDavis recently wrote to Pelosi to say his team had reviewed Capitol Hill security footage in the lead-up to January 6, 2021, and found no evidence of Republican lawmakers organizing “reconnaissance” tours as has been previously suggested by certain Democratic members.\n\nLofgren said Republicans are politicizing the issue of Capitol Hill security and discredited the GOP notion that Pelosi is somehow responsible for any breakdowns.\n\n“It’s obviously B.S., and it’s totally motivated by their effort to turn everything into a political game,” Lofgren said.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-transcripts-detail-numerous-warning-signs-potential-violence-cap-rcna63647', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 transcripts detail numerous warning signs of potential for ...', 'Snippet': 'November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}}",89.5,1

He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he finished signing the bill.\n\nThe legislation came together in the aftermath of recent mass shootings at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-25/emboldened-biden-dems-push-ban-on-so-called-assault-weapons', 'Headline': 'Emboldened Biden and Democrats push to revive the assault weapons ban', 'Snippet': 'When Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Biden speaks about the “scourge” of gun violence, his focus returns to reviving a ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe reiterated that call this week after shootings in Colorado and Virginia: Biden wants to sign into law a renewed ban on high-powered guns that have the capacity to kill many people very quickly.\n\n“The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick,” Biden said on Thanksgiving Day. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.”\n\nAfter the mass killing last Saturday at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, he said in a statement: “When will we decide we’ve had enough? ... We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”\n\nWhen Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading. By comparison, New York Police Department officers carry a handgun that shoots about half that much.\n\nA weapons ban is far off in a closely divided Congress. But Biden and the Democrats have become increasingly emboldened in pushing for stronger gun controls — and doing so with no clear electoral consequences.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed legislation in July to revive a 1990s-era ban on assault weapons, with Biden’s vocal support. And the president pushed a ban nearly everywhere that he campaigned this year.\n\nIn the midterm elections, Democrats kept control of the Senate and Republicans were able to claim a House majority by a narrower margin than they had expected.\n\nThe tough talk follows passage in June of a landmark bipartisan bill on gun laws, and it reflects steady progress that gun control advocates have been making in recent years.\n\n“I think the American public has been waiting for this message,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been the Senate’s leading advocate for stronger gun restrictions since the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. “There has been a thirst from voters, especially swing voters, young voters, parents, to hear candidates talk about gun violence, and I think Democrats are finally sort of catching up with where the public has been.”\n\nJust over half of voters want to see nationwide gun policy made more strict, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide conducted for the Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About 3 in 10 want gun policy kept as is, and 14% prefer looser gun laws.\n\nThere are clear partisan divides. About 9 in 10 Democrats want stricter gun laws, compared with about 3 in 10 Republicans. About half of Republicans want gun laws left as they are, and one-quarter want to see gun laws be made less strict.\n\nOnce banned in the United States, the high-powered firearms are now the weapon of choice among young men responsible for many of the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later, unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban.\n\nWhen he was governor of Florida, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott signed gun control laws in the wake of mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he has consistently opposed weapons bans, arguing like many of his Republican colleagues that most gun owners use them lawfully.\n\n“People are doing the right thing; why would we take away their weapons?” Scott asked as the Senate was negotiating gun legislation last summer. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nHe said more mental health counseling, assessments of troubled students and law enforcement on campus make more sense.\n\n“Let’s focus on things that actually would change something,” Scott said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long called for stricter gun laws, arguing that the availability of these weapons makes people less safe and makes their jobs more dangerous.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore, who heads the country’s third-largest police department, said it just makes sense to talk about restricting firearms when gun violence is rising nationwide, and consider what the government can do to make the streets safer. He said he is grateful Biden is bringing it up so much.\n\n“This isn’t a one-and-done,” Moore said of the shooting last weekend at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. “These things are evolving all the time, in other cities, at any moment another incident happens. It’s crying out for the federal government, for our legislators, to go out and make this change,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, six people were shot dead at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Over the last six months there has been a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., a massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas, and the Fourth of July parade killing of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.\n\nThe legislation that Biden signed in June will, among other things, help states put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged to be dangerous.\n\nBut a ban was never on the table.\n\nA 60-vote threshold in the Senate means some Republicans must be on board. Most are steadfastly opposed, arguing it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\n“I’d rather not try to define a whole group of guns as being no longer available to the American public,” Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said. “For those of us who have grown up with guns as part of our culture, and we use them as tools — there’s millions of us, there’s hundreds of millions of us — that use them lawfully.”\n\nIn many states where the bans have been enacted, the restrictions are being challenged in court, gaining strength from a Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights.\n\n“We feel pretty confident, even despite the arguments made by the other side, that history and tradition as well as the text of the 2nd Amendment are on our side,” said David Warrington, chairman and general counsel for the National Foundation for Gun Rights.\n\nBiden was instrumental in helping secure the 1990s ban as a senator. The White House has noted statistics showing that while it was in place, mass shootings declined, and when it expired in 2004, shootings tripled.\n\nThe reality is complicated. The data on the effectiveness is mixed and there is a sense that other measures that are not as politically fraught might actually be more effective, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.”\n\nPolitically, the ban sparked a backlash, even though the final law was a compromise version of the initial bill, he said.\n\n“The gun community was furious,” Spitzer said.\n\nThe ban has been blamed in some circles for the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1994, though subsequent research has shown that the loss was probably more about strong, well-funded conservative candidates and district boundaries, Spitzer said.\n\nStill, after Democrat Al Gore, who supported stricter gun laws, lost the 2000 White House race to Republican George W. Bush, Democrats largely backed off the issue until the Sandy Hook shooting a decade ago. Even after that, it was not a campaign topic until the 2018 midterms.\n\nNow, gun control advocates see progress.\n\n“The fact that the American people elected a president who has long been a vocal and steadfast supporter of bold gun safety laws — and recently reelected a gun-sense majority to the Senate — says everything you need to know about how dramatically the politics on this issue have shifted,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-landmark-gun-legislation-god-willing-s-going-lot-lives-rcna35326', 'Headline': ""Biden signs landmark gun legislation: 'God willing, it's going to save ..."", 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of meetings with world leaders.\n\nBiden called the signing of the legislation a ""monumental day"" and said it was proof that Democrats and Republicans could find common ground on important issues.\n\n“God willing, it\'s going to save a lot of lives,"" he said.\n\nThe bill provides grants to states for “red flag” laws, enhances background checks to include juvenile records, and closes the “boyfriend loophole” by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse. It will also require enhanced background checks for people ages 18 to 21 and funding for youth mental health services.\n\nThe bipartisan gun legislation sped through Congress in the month after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. Democrats unanimously voted in favor of the bill along with more than two dozen Republicans in the House and the Senate, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n""When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,"" Biden said. ""If we can reach a compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans health care to cutting-edge American innovation to so much more.""\n\nHe had pleaded with lawmakers to pass legislation tightening gun laws following the shootings in Buffalo, New York, and in Uvalde. But the bill stopped short of his call for Congress to ban assault weapons and to require background checks for all gun purchases, both of which are widely opposed by Republicans in Congress.\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” Biden said. “God bless us with the strength to get the work left done.”\n\nThe bill gives Biden a win following two major blows from the Supreme Court over the past week. The court ruled Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating a woman\'s constitutional right to an abortion. And on Thursday, it struck down a New York law that required showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.\n\n“I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions,” Biden said when asked about those rulings by a reporter.\n\nBiden signed the gun legislation moments before heading to Europe for a week of meetings with Group of Seven leaders in Germany and with NATO leaders in Spain. When he returns, he said, he plans to have an event at the White House with the lawmakers who helped pass the bill.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61919752', 'Headline': 'Congress passes first gun control bill in decades - BBC', 'Snippet': ""The landmark bipartisan bill now heads to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. ...

We can\'t fail the American people again.""\n\nOn the Senate side, a deal may be further away but a bipartisan group of senators led by John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., spent the past week attempting to reach a deal on potential legislation that would address gun violence.\n\nOn the table are state incentives to pass red flag laws, updates to school safety protocols and changes to background checks.\n\nBut it is easier said than done. GOP members have historically stood together in opposition to any law that could limit gun rights.\n\nSeparately in the Democratic-controlled House, the Judiciary Committee held a testy markup Thursday to advance a series of bills that would, among other things, raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, ban high-capacity magazines and increase background check requirements — nearly all of the provisions Biden advocated for in his speech.\n\nThe full House could vote as early as next week on the package. The prospect of that measure making any headway in the Senate are close to nil.\n\nWithout congressional action, executive action is limited.

There, the President reiterated his view that Xi is a “dictator,” after being asked by a reporter whether he stood by a comment saying as much this past June.\n\nAt that point, Beijing reacted with vitriol, with the remark seen as casting a shadow over tentative progress in advancing dialogue between the two sides following a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s latest comment at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday, a spokesperson called it “extremely erroneous” and an “irresponsible political maneuver, which China firmly opposes.”\n\n“What needs to be pointed out is that there will always be some people with ulterior motives attempting to undermine China-US relations. They will not succeed in doing so,” spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether there will be any further reaction this time, but the response comes as China’s signaling around the San Francisco Bay Area meeting between Xi and Biden has marked a shift away from its hardline position on the United States. This softening comes as China grapples with a troubled economy and is keen to highlight Xi as a powerful and capable world leader.\n\nAccording to statements from both the US and China Wednesday, the two sides agreed to restore military communications and to combat the flow of fentanyl from China to the US during several hours of “constructive” meetings.\n\nChina labeled the talks as “positive” and “comprehensive” — while also highlighting Xi’s efforts to spell out Beijing’s non-negotiables such as its position on Taiwan and perceived American efforts to contain China’s rise.\n\nXi’s optics\n\nOn Chinese state media and across social media platforms, where the hashtag #Planet-Earth-Is-Big-Enough-For-Both-China-And-The-US was trending, the broad perception appeared to be of a job well done.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV highlighted how Biden invited Xi for a walk around the leafy estate where the meeting took place and that the American leader “personally escorted him to his car to bid goodbye” — a detail that was also highlighted in another top-trending hashtag on Chinese social media.\n\nThe positive coverage of the event was a break from the typical rhetoric critical of the US that often plays across Chinese state and social media. Anti-US rhetoric has been a significant theme boosting growth in Chinese nationalism as tensions flared between the two in recent years.\n\nThe optics of a warm welcome and the display of a commanding presence next to Biden are critically important for Xi, who analysts say was not only keen to stabilize a complicated relationship at a time of economic weakness, but also to present himself to his domestic audience as skillfully helming China’s foreign affairs.\n\nXi’s visit came as the Chinese economy struggles with a property market crisis, high local government debt and record youth unemployment. At the same time, crackdowns across several sectors have pummeled business confidence and led many to question what opportunities remained in China.\n\n“These challenges are tremendous,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, who noted that in California, Xi wanted to show viewers back home his “leadership capacity in the foreign affairs arena” and that he is highly regarded in America and a world leader on par with Biden.\n\nA press conference with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in California following the bilateral meeting also underscored some of those optics.\n\nWang noted that Biden sent a “separate invitation to President Xi Jinping specifically to hold a heads of state meeting,” unlike other bilateral meeting arrangements happening during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum that Xi and other leaders from across the Pacific are in town to attend.\n\n“(The Xi-Biden meeting) is sure to become a milestone … and a major event in today’s international relations,” Wang said, pointing out that the four-hour face-to-face talks were held “amidst the backdrop of a critical stage in China-US relations.”\n\nXi also took a conciliatory tone speaking at a dinner event in front of American CEOs later that day.\n\nHe told the audience the most fundamental question shaping US-China relations is whether they are rivals or partners.\n\n“If we regard each other as the biggest rival, the most significant geopolitical challenge and an ever-pressing threat, it will inevitably lead to wrong policies, wrong actions and wrong results,” Xi told an audience that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n“China is willing to be a partner and friend of the United States,” he added.\n\n‘Bottom lines’\n\nWhile it helped to advance dialogue and cooperation, the meeting was also a chance for both sides to highlight their differences — and showed areas where they did not reach consensus, which analysts say will continue to define their contentious relationship.\n\nAnd even within areas where they two sides did come to agreement, there remains fragile ground.\n\nChina’s announcement of the restoration of military communications, which the Biden administration had long pushed for, said those would resume “on the basis of equality and respect.”\n\n“What that means is in the future anytime China is annoyed with anything the US does, China can say it’s cutting off military-to-military dialogues again and blame it on the US (for) no longer making China feel ‘respected,’” said Wen-Ti Sung, a Taiwan-based fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\n\n“(This) undermines the basis of the talks’ resumption and existence,” he added.\n\nOn Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that China’s ruling Communist Party claims, Xi urged the US to stop arming the island and to support China’s “peaceful reunification,” according to China’s readout of the meeting released by state media.\n\n“China will eventually achieve reunification, and will inevitably achieve reunification,” Xi was quoted as saying — another line that was also trending on Chinese social media following the meeting.\n\nBiden, for his part, reaffirmed the long-standing American position on Taiwan and its opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo, saying cross-strait differences must be “resolved by peaceful means,” according to a readout from the White House.\n\nXi also called on the US to “not scheme to suppress or contain China,” in an apparent reference to America’s strengthening of its alliances in Asia and what Beijing sees as efforts to stymie its economic development with trade and investment restrictions on high tech. Washington says those curbs are intended to protect its national security against an assertive and authoritarian China.\n\n“Both sides should understand each other’s principles and bottom lines,” Xi added.\n\nThe deep concerns each has about the other’s intentions are unlikely to be soothed after one meeting. How those agreements are executed in the weeks and months to come say much about whether China and the US are both committed to lasting stability.\n\n“The meeting indicates that the US-China relationship is not going to further worsen in the next year, but will it rebound very quickly and become significantly warmer very soon? I would say no,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at City University of Hong Kong.\n\n“Of course, Xi Jinping wants better US-China relations, but (Beijing) realizes … the fundamental fact (is) that the US wants to contain China, so their expectation is that warmer relations are good, but as long as they don’t get worse, they can accept that,” he said.\n\nOne immediate indicator of how relations will progress may be seen in any further response from Beijing to Biden’s “dictator” comment, and whether its state media and social media platforms continue gloss over the comment to focus on the positive outcomes from Wednesday.\n\nBiden himself seems to indicate hope that the two can work through their differences as he noted that “(Xi) is a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is communist” and that the Chinese government “is totally different than ours.”\n\n“Anyway,” he added. “We made progress.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/07/25/international-opinion-of-joe-biden-in-6-charts/', 'Headline': 'International opinion of Joe Biden in 6 charts - Pew Research Center', 'Snippet': 'A median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.

In the Asia ...', 'Full_text': 'For over 20 years, Pew Research Center has tracked international public opinion of world leaders, including the U.S. president. In his second year in office, Joe Biden receives generally positive ratings in the countries surveyed by the Center. In most of these places, Biden’s ratings are higher than those of his predecessor in the White House, Donald Trump, but lower than his own ratings in 2021.\n\nHere are six charts on what people in surveyed countries think of Biden, based on polls conducted in each nation in the spring of 2022.\n\nA median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nConfidence in Biden varies widely by region and country. In Europe alone, the share of adults who offer a positive rating of Biden ranges from 82% in Poland to just under a third (31%) in Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea and Japan stand out with 70% and 62% of adults, respectively, saying they have confidence in the U.S. president. Opinion is more divided in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore.\n\nIn Israel, six-in-ten adults say they have confidence in Biden, though fewer than half attach positive descriptors to him like “strong leader” (41% say this about him), “caring about ordinary people” (36%) and “charismatic” (27%).\n\nConfidence in Biden has dropped significantly in most places surveyed in 2021 and 2022. The share of adults who have confidence in Biden on the world stage has decreased by double digits in 13 of the 14 countries surveyed in both years. In Italy, Greece, Spain and Singapore, half or more now have little or no confidence in the U.S. president. Still, in most places – including key European countries – confidence in Biden remains higher than confidence in Trump. Israel is the one exception: While 60% of Israelis have confidence in Biden, 71% said the same about Trump in 2019.\n\nOlder adults generally have more confidence in Biden than younger adults. In most countries surveyed, adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden. For example, nearly three-quarters of Belgians ages 50 and older give Biden positive ratings on the world stage, compared with roughly half of Belgians ages 18 to 29. Double-digit differences also exist in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and France.\n\nIn Hungary, Italy and Poland, the opposite pattern appears: Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have confidence in Biden.\n\nThere is more public approval than disapproval of Biden’s choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan – but low ratings of the withdrawal itself. A median of 52% of adults across 18 countries surveyed say it was the right decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while 39% say it was the wrong decision. Responses vary by region, and in Poland, Israel, Japan and Hungary, roughly two-in-ten do not offer a response.\n\nAcross all 18 countries, a median of just a third of adults (33%) say the withdrawal was handled well. Far more (median of 56%) say it was not handled well.\n\nAmericans’ views of the decision to withdraw troops, as well as the execution of the plan, are largely aligned with views from around the world. Six-in-ten Americans say it was the right decision, while 38% hold the opposite view. And roughly a third (32%) say the withdrawal was handled well, whereas two-thirds (66%) say it was not.\n\nIn places where the U.S. is seen more favorably, so is Biden. For example, the two countries surveyed where people have the most favorable views of the United States – Poland and South Korea – are also among the countries where people have the most confidence in Biden.\n\nIn nearly all countries surveyed, more people express a favorable view of the U.S. than confidence in Biden – though the opposite is true in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Malaysia. In Germany and Australia, the share of adults with a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in Biden are roughly the same. This pattern holds at the individual level as well: Favorable views of the U.S. correlate with positive ratings of Biden.\n\nConfidence in Biden is similar to confidence in other Western leaders. A median of 58% of adults across the 18 surveyed countries have confidence in Biden’s handling of global affairs, just a few points lower than the median share who say the same about French President Emmanuel Macron (61%) and equal to positive ratings of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (58%). Larger shares, however, say they are not confident in Biden than say the same of his German counterpart.\n\nWithin specific countries, there are greater differences in ratings of the three leaders. In Poland and Israel, for instance, larger shares are more confident in Biden than either of his European counterparts, while in Greece, it is Macron who receives the highest ratings.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/21/politics/biden-xi-china-dictators-fundraiser/index.html', 'Headline': 'Fierce backlash in Beijing to Biden likening Xi to a dictator ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'When President Joe Biden referred to his Chinese counterpart as a dictator late Tuesday in California, the response from Beijing was swift and angry. “The remarks seriously contradict basic ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Joe Biden referred to his Chinese counterpart as a dictator late Tuesday in California, the response from Beijing was swift and angry.\n\n“The remarks seriously contradict basic facts, seriously violate diplomatic etiquette, and seriously infringe on China’s political dignity,” the spokesperson for the foreign ministry said.\n\nWhether the new acrimony further derails a “thaw” in US-China ties, something that Biden has openly hoped for, remained an open question.\n\nOfficials at the White House made no attempt to clarify Biden’s remark. And while some US officials expressed surprise after reading the president’s quotes, there was little to indicate he misspoke while detailing his view of the spy balloon incident earlier this year that temporarily caused a pause in US-China relations.\n\n“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is he didn’t know it was there,” Biden told Democratic donors underneath a white tent in a backyard in Marin County. “No, I’m serious. That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn’t know what happened.”\n\nBiden’s assessment that President Xi Jinping had been in the dark about the balloon accurately reflects US intelligence about the episode, one person familiar with the matter said. But revealing that information in public – as Biden has done twice now over the past few days – caught some officials off guard since it had previously only been the private assessment of the situation.\n\n“He didn’t know about it,” Biden told donors. “When it got shot down he was very embarrassed and he denied it was even there.”\n\nAnother senior administration official said Biden’s candor on China was hardly shocking.\n\n“It should come as no surprise that the president speaks candidly about China and the differences that we have – we are certainly not alone in that,” the senior administration official said.\n\nPerhaps more surprising than the content of Biden’s remarks, however, was their timing. Biden was speaking at a fragile moment for US-China ties, days after a high-profile diplomatic visit to Beijing by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to yield a pause in the enmity. Describing Xi as “very embarrassed” and out of touch may act counter to those efforts.\n\nDuring his visit, Blinken met for just over half-an-hour with Xi in what was later described as a “constructive” conversation.\n\nBlinken hasn’t yet returned to Washington to brief Biden in-person on his visit, though White House officials said that was planned as soon as he’s back. Washington’s top diplomat said Monday that the US and China had made “progress” toward bringing relations back on track with both sides agreeing on the need to “stabilize” their bilateral relationship.\n\nThe senior administration official expressed confidence Biden’s comments would not upend US diplomatic efforts with China, asserting “every expectation of building on” the progress Blinken made during his recent visit to Beijing.\n\n“The president believes that diplomacy, including that undertaken by Secretary Blinken, is the responsible way to manage tensions. Secretary Blinken had a good trip and made some progress. We have every expectation of building on that progress,” the official said.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks Tuesday, Biden praised Blinken’s work to repair the relationship by reiterating he “did a good job” and adding that improving the relationship would “take time.” At a second fundraiser Tuesday, Biden told donors that US climate envoy John Kerry would also hopefully be making a trip to China “pretty soon” with a focus on the environment.\n\nBiden himself told reporters over the weekend he hoped to meet Xi in the coming months, believing high-level engagement is the only way to prevent the relationship from spiraling into conflict. After his comment, some officials said it was too soon to say whether the fundraiser remarks would cause another breakdown in relations.\n\n“That’s up to China,” one official said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was too early to speculate whether such a meeting could occur on the sidelines of this year’s Group of 20 summit in India, scheduled for September. Biden and Xi last met at a G20 conference in Bali.\n\nThe two presidents could also arrange a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit Biden is hosting in November in San Francisco. Xi last visited the United States in 2017 for talks with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he didn’t have any time or dates for a Biden-Xi meeting: “I don’t have anything to speak to with respect to the next discussion slash meeting with President Xi,” he said.\n\nCiting Biden’s comments about a potential meeting in the coming months, Kirby said, “That will happen and it’ll happen at the appropriate time.”\n\n“Whether it happens at the G20 this year or not, I simply don’t know and wouldn’t speak to this early on,” he went on.\n\nBiden details tension with China\n\nThe president on Tuesday went into additional detail on some of the ongoing tension between the two superpowers. He said that while China’s leader was “embarrassed” about the balloon incident, what “he was really upset about” was Biden’s efforts since taking office to bring the leaders of the Quad – the United States, India, Australia and Japan – closer together to serve as a counterweight to a more assertive China.\n\n“He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,” Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. “We’re just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.”\n\nAt least in the near term, Biden’s remark prompted China’s friends to demonstrate their allegiances.\n\n“These are very contradictory manifestations of US foreign policy, which, on the one hand, reflect its unpredictability, [and] on the other hand, a continuation of the US mentoring policy,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his regular press briefing.\n\nPeskov said that Russia has “its own very bad relations” with the US, while it had “very good relations” with China.\n\nBiden’s comments Tuesday likening Xi to “dictators” marked the latest example of a president who often speaks more freely when cameras are off at fundraisers, including offering more candid musings about other world leaders and foreign affairs.\n\nThe president issued a chilling warning to Democratic donors in New York City last year when he mused about the threat of nuclear “Armageddon” amid concerns Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats - comments that went beyond how other US officials had spoken about the matter.\n\nIn another fundraiser last fall, the president used Italy’s election of a far right leader to warn Democrats not to be “sanguine about what’s happening here” heading into the midterm elections.\n\n“You just saw what’s happened in Italy in that election,” Biden told the donors and Democratic officials at a Washington, DC, fundraiser. “You’re seeing what’s happening around the world. And the reason I bother to say that is we can’t be sanguine about what’s happening here either. I don’t want to exaggerate it, but I don’t want to understate it.”\n\nAnd on at least one occasion, he disclosed details of a private conversation with a world leader during a fundraiser, revealing that French President Emmanuel Macron was the leader who asked him how long America is “back” for at a G7 summit on the Cornish coast in England.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/politics/joe-biden-israel-dilemma/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden’s dilemma in Israel response: Outrage without escalation', 'Snippet': 'When President Joe Biden gathered with his top advisers Tuesday morning to go over the draft of his speech on Israel, he made a clear request: The prepared remarks needed to include more details ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Joe Biden gathered with his top advisers Tuesday morning to go over the draft of his speech on Israel, he made a clear request: The prepared remarks needed to include more details on the appalling nature of the attacks that began four days earlier.\n\nThe American people must understand just how shocking and gruesome Hamas’ actions were, Biden told his aides. Later that day, speaking from the State Dining Room of the White House, Biden would describe parents butchered as they tried to protect their children, babies murdered, and women raped and assaulted.\n\n“This,” Biden said, “was an act of sheer evil.”\n\nBiden’s deep, emotional reaction to the attack has translated into a forceful American response, including ordering US warships and planes into the region, ratcheting up intelligence sharing and making little attempt at encouraging restraint in Israel’s reprisals.\n\nGoing forward, however, the president will face a delicate balance as he works to support America’s ally while also avoiding becoming embroiled in another foreign conflict. It all is reflective of a complicated dilemma for the president, who now faces wars in Europe and the Middle East at the same time he is ramping up a campaign for reelection premised largely on his experience as a stable, competent leader.\n\nIn closed-door briefings and conversations with his team, Biden has emphasized the importance of getting the response right – and the dire consequences should the US miscalculate or misstep.\n\n“I just think that if we stay true to our values, pursue with every inch and every bit of our energy to get this right, we can bury this again and bring people back, bring people home. I think we can change the Middle East,” Biden told a group of Jewish American leaders on Wednesday. “But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist.”\n\nSo far, the balance has been playing out both in public and private.\n\nIn his conversations with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden has reiterated he understands the necessity of an overwhelming retaliation, but he has also raised the importance of adhering to the rules of war and sparing the lives of civilians.\n\nAnd even as American officials have openly acknowledged Iran’s role in supporting Hamas over the years, they are wary of the reality that should a direct link between Tehran and the weekend’s rampage be drawn, there is a greater risk of being dragged into a wider regional conflict.\n\nEven amid a dire hostage crisis, the US has maintained that it has no intention, at present, of sending American troops into the fight. But that position could change if the conflict intensifies.\n\n“If tomorrow Hezbollah started launching missiles into Israel, that would be seen as a real escalation,” according to a person close to the situation.\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said the US so far has not seen rogue actors skirt its warnings against widening the war but noted that “it’s not the kind of thing that they, you know, phone in.”\n\nAnd Biden, speaking Wednesday, said his moves so far in the region are meant in part to send a message to the Iranians: “Be careful.”\n\nBiden walks a fine line\n\nWith the images still coming in of the horrors inflicted upon civilians by Hamas, backing for Israel remains mostly unified within the administration and among American lawmakers.\n\nBut administration officials don’t necessarily expect that to last forever, particularly if civilians in Gaza bear the brunt of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks. Already, electricity and food are in short supply in the blockaded territory.\n\nIn his private conversations with Netanyahu, Biden has not urged the Israeli leader to practice restraint in its counterattack against Hamas. When they spoke Tuesday, he told his counterpart that if a terror attack of similar scale occurred in the United States, the response would be “swift, decisive, and overwhelming.”\n\nBut the president also discussed with his counterpart his concerns about civilian casualties and the importance of minimizing collateral damage in the coming days.\n\n“It is really important that Israel, in all the anger and frustration – I don’t know how to explain it – that exists, they operate by the rules of war,” Biden told the Jewish leaders Wednesday, adding later that “it’s not about revenge.”\n\nAs the world braces for a new war in the Middle East, with the prospect of escalation far beyond Israel and Gaza, Biden’s lifetime of experience and worldview comes into sharper focus. From his first visit to Israel in 1973 – which he recounted in his speech Tuesday – to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the vice presidency to the Oval Office, no American president has had a similar breadth of exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt is that unparalleled background, allies say, that will guide Biden’s next steps through remarkably uneven geopolitical crosscurrents of aid for Israel, funding for Ukraine and relations with Iran.\n\nBut it is also Biden’s unapologetic decision to withdraw from Afghanistan three years ago – defiantly but chaotically ending America’s longest war – that also serves as a guidepost for him.\n\n“This president knows every side of this,” a senior US official told CNN, “and he will not be pushed into something he is not comfortable with.”\n\nUS ramps up its presence\n\nThe Biden administration has deployed a number of assets to the region in a show of force and a warning to any hostile parties considering getting involved. A carrier strike force is now stationed in the Mediterranean, and the Defense Department has sent planes from Europe with ammunition and interceptors requested by Netanyahu that landed overnight.\n\n“The landing of American military planes – even without troops on the ground – sends the message of deterrence,” said a senior administration official.\n\nThere could be more measures taken in the future. A second senior administration official told CNN that the US wants to “see what effect” the existing actions have before deploying more.\n\nAmid concerns of the US being drawn into a Middle East conflict, a senior Israeli official told CNN’s Matthew Chance that “Israel does not expect the United States to fight for us,” saying that a US aircraft carrier group newly positioned off the Israeli coast would help provide “long-range coverage” in the event of a broader regional conflict.\n\nThe White House has remained loathe to commit to a particular role as the situation remains fluid.\n\n“I’m not here to draw red lines or issue warnings or give lectures to anybody,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters this week. “I’m here to say the president has given us direction to take a series of actions. We are undertaking those actions and we will continue to do so in the weeks ahead.”\n\nA deeply emotional moment\n\nAdvisers to the president say the past five days have been a deeply emotional time for him, as he has grappled with the second major outbreak of a war during his presidency and the images and stories of Hamas’ heinous actions have poured in.\n\n“He has always approached Israel with moral clarity and full commitment,” a senior adviser to the president told CNN.\n\nBiden’s four telephone calls with Netanyahu have been tinged with emotion as the extent of the horrors becomes clearer. A person familiar with the conversations said the first, early on Saturday morning, was “raw” as the devastation came to light.\n\n“He can hear the pain in Prime Minister Netanyahu’s voice when he talks to him,” Sullivan said this week. “I hear the pain of my counterparts when I talk to them.”\n\nThe calculated approach to Netanyahu will be a central component of Biden’s response to this weekend’s attack. The men have known each other for decades and have relied on that history as they weathered deep strains over the past year related to Netanyahu’s far-right governing coalition.\n\nBiden believes he knows Netanyahu “better than anyone,” one official said, and in the past has carefully applied pressure on the Israeli leader to avoid inflaming or escalating conflicts with the Palestinians.\n\nYet history may offer far less of a roadmap for Biden on another front, as support for Israel has fallen among some quarters of the Democratic Party, and he enters a yearlong reelection bid with the Middle East suddenly front-and-center in the US presidential campaign.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, called the attack by Hamas “absolutely horrific,” but said in an interview on Wednesday that Congress should have a “nuanced” conversation on the conflict moving forward.\n\n“This is a situation of incredible trauma for Israelis, especially on Saturday, and Palestinians who have been enduring the realities of occupation for decades,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. “And I think there needs to be space for us and the ability for us to have that real conversation, that nuanced conversation that sees the humanity of everyone impacted.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/4cb89f5a-fb08-403d-892b-0c8e496926e8', 'Headline': 'China hits out at US after Joe Biden calls Xi Jinping a ‘dictator’', 'Snippet': 'The Chinese foreign ministry described Biden’s remarks as “extremely absurd and irresponsible”, adding that they “seriously violate basic facts, diplomatic protocols and China’s ...', 'Full_text': ""Then €69 per month.

Exit polls Tuesday showed that, by a two-thirds margin, voters would prefer that he step aside. “My intention is that I will run again,” said Biden, who turns 80 this month. “But I’m a great respecter of fate. And this is ultimately a family decision.”\n\nBiden’s future will be front of mind as he heads first to Egypt, then Cambodia and Bali, where he has meetings with leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to discuss issues like the global economy, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nBiden’s counterparts overseas are looking for stability in American leadership and foreign policy, coming off years of political turbulence with no quick end in sight. At a meeting last year of the leaders of the seven largest advanced economies, he told the group, “America is back,” the president recalled at the news conference. “For how long?” one retorted.\n\nThe U.S. presidency has changed hands three times in the last five years and is up for grabs again in 2024. Sandwiched between the Biden and Obama presidencies was Donald Trump, who scorned the commitment to alliances and collaborative action that has defined American foreign policy in the post-World War II era.\n\nDefeated presidents seldom make a comeback, but Trump may announce his re-election bid next week. “If an election between Trump and Biden were held today, Trump would win and he would win in a landslide,” John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, said in an interview before the midterm elections. “Right now, Trump is the gorilla in the room.”\n\nEven if Trump were to skip the race, his movement has spawned a series of imitators who’ve bought into his “America First” foreign policy credo and may run in his stead. For the world leaders meeting with Biden over the next week, there’s no assurance that he'll be the president they’ll be dealing with for the next six years.\n\n“I don’t know that he has removed the cloud looming overhead of being a lame-duck president for two years,” said Brett Bruen, who was director of global engagement in Barack Obama’s second term. “If I’m a [world leader] looking at where I want to invest my political capital, I don’t think that Biden is going to be able to deliver aid or engagement on the hard issues of my country or region.”\n\nBiden arrives in Egypt on Friday for a conference focused on the global climate crisis. He then heads to Cambodia for meetings with Asian leaders, with whom he hopes to cement ties as the U.S. looks to curb China’s growing global influence.\n\nHe’ll be skipping a separate Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Thailand late next week, an event that conflicts with his granddaughter Naomi Biden’s wedding on the White House’s South Lawn.\n\nA challenge for Biden is to “persuade allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region that the U.S. is committed to the region and to them for the long haul,” said Matthew Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nGiven that, “I think the president’s nonattendance at APEC is an unforced error,” Goodman said. “I think he should have found a way to be there for a few hours to reassure the region that he was committed … ”\n\nThe focal point of Biden’s entire trip figures to be a private meeting in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday with China's Xi, the first time they’ll have spoken in person since Biden took office. The two will meet on the sidelines of a meeting of the G-20, a group of nations that account for 80 percent of the world economy.\n\nExpectations are low. The two leaders will not put out a joint statement, nor are they likely to announce any agreements, an administration official told reporters. The idea is for Biden and Xi to talk candidly, “build a floor for the relationship” and stop “the downward spiral,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. is unnerved by Chinese military exercises that threaten Taiwan and raise the specter of a future invasion. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August, the Chinese conducted retaliatory military drills signaling its displeasure. A Chinese government spokesman described the exercises as “a warning” to anyone wishing to establish Taiwan’s independence.\n\nWhat might come out of Biden’s appearance at the G-20 is nothing that will turn “the tide in the relationship, but just the minimum necessary to prepare ourselves for even choppier waters ahead in the U.S.-China relationship,” said David Shullman, senior director of the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.\n\nA central issue at the G-20 meetings will be the grinding war between Russia and Ukraine. But the instigator of the conflict isn’t planning to attend. Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing setbacks on the battlefield, was bound to be vilified at the summit had he decided to show, analysts said.\n\n“The noose is getting tighter and tighter around Putin,” said Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center. “So I don’t think he gains anything by going to the G-20. To the contrary, he’s just going to get lots of lectures.”\n\nOne of Biden’s aims is to persuade leaders that democracies are preferable to the autocratic model that China and Russia have embraced. Undercutting that argument was the Jan. 6 insurrection, when rioters breached the U.S. Capitol and disrupted the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThe midterm election results buoy Biden in this respect, with some of Trump’s handpicked candidates losing and finding a limited appetite for the baseless argument that the 2020 race was stolen. In defeat, a few high-profile Republican candidates he endorsed have even graciously accept the results rather than peddle claims of voter fraud.\n\n“Tuesday was a good day for America, a good day for democracy,” Biden said Thursday at a Democratic National Committee event.\n\nAnother reason that Biden might find the trip more gratifying is that he averted the midterm wipeout that sitting presidents normally endure. Though control of Congress is still up in the air, Biden can face his fellow leaders knowing that GOP lawmakers won’t be in prime position to unravel his policies, as they’d hoped to do.\n\nThe last Democratic president to visit Asia right after midterms arrived under grimmer circumstances. Obama’s party had lost more than 60 House seats and a half-dozen Senate seats in 2010. In his memoir, “A Promised Land,” Obama wrote that as Air Force One flew to India after what he famously called a “shellacking” in the midterms, he was unable to wind down and scared up a card game with his weary staff. The morning after the election, he wrote, he awoke “with a mix of weariness, hurt, anger and shame, the way a boxer must feel after coming out on the wrong end of a heavyweight bout.”\n\nThere was never any doubt, though, that Obama would run for a second term. Biden’s midterm test went much better. For the next week he’ll be touting the resilience of America’s democratic tradition. He’ll be back in the company of his fellow leaders, who may still want an answer to the question they posed to him last year: for how long?""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65969802', 'Headline': 'US-China tensions: Biden calls Xi a dictator a day after Beijing ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'China\'s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called Mr Biden\'s remarks ""extremely absurd and irresponsible"".

Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.""\n\nBiden said the sanctions were designed to have a long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and its allies. And he said Washington was prepared to do more. He added that the sanctions would limit Russia\'s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.\n\nBiden said NATO would meet on Friday to map out further measures. He reiterated that the U.S. would not engage in war with Russia but that it would meet its Article 5 commitments to defend partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nThe U.S. president said this was a dangerous moment for all of Europe and that he had authorized troops that had been placed on standby to deploy to Germany.\n\n""Putin\'s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly,"" Biden said. ""Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.""\n\nOn Friday, the United Nations Security Council will vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia for invading Ukraine and require Moscow to immediately and unconditionally withdraw, but the measure is set to fail because Moscow can cast a veto.\n\nAlthough action will be blocked in the 15-member Security Council, Washington and allies see a vote as a chance to show Moscow is isolated over its actions. Diplomats said it appeared at least 11 members would vote in favour, while it was unclear how China, India and the United Arab Emirates would vote.\n\nCanada, EU announce sanctions\n\nCanada also announced more sanctions on Thursday, targeting 62 individuals and entities connected to Russia, including members of the elite and major banks, and cancelled all export permits following the attack on Ukraine.\n\n""Today, in light of Russia\'s reckless and dangerous military strike, we are imposing further, severe sanctions,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference.\n\n""These sanctions are wide-reaching.

Biden, who spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky late on Wednesday, also convened his National Security Council on Thursday to discuss the situation.\n\nHis announcement represented the second major tranche of sanctions against Russia since Putin earlier this week declared two breakaway regions of Ukraine independent and sent troops there.\n\nThe U.S. had warned it would initiate waves of sanctions against Moscow if it further invaded Ukraine, and Russia\'s full-on military assault launched on Thursday led to the latest round of penalties in co-operation with Western allies.\n\nBritain unveiled new measures targeting banks, members of Putin\'s inner circle and the very wealthy who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament that leaders had agreed to work together to ""maximize the economic price"" Putin will pay.\n\nIn addition, Britain will also prohibit Russia\'s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at British airports.\n\nOn Wednesday, Washington imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia\'s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and on Tuesday it sanctioned two large Russian financial institutions and Russian sovereign debt, along with some members of the Russian elite and their family members.\n\nBiden had faced political pressure at home to impose sanctions before Putin invaded. The White House has held open the door to diplomacy, even agreeing in principle earlier to a summit between the president and Putin if Russia did not invade.\n\nNATO summit Friday\n\nNATO moved to beef up its eastern flank facing Russia and planned a virtual leaders\' summit for Friday after Putin warned anyone listening that any interference would ""lead to consequences you have never seen in history.""\n\nIn a joint statement earlier, G7 leaders said Putin had reintroduced war to the European continent.\n\n""This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe,"" the leaders said.\n\n""He has put himself on the wrong side of history,"" the leaders said in the statement released by Germany.\n\nThe leaders also earlier said they supported consistent and constructive engagement and co-ordination among major energy producers and consumers toward stable global energy supplies and were ready to act to address potential disruption.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said France and its European allies did everything they could to try to head off the attack on Ukraine.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Macron said that Russia\'s attack is a ""turning point in European history"" and as a result, ""there will be profound consequences for our continent and changes in our lives.""\n\n""To this act of war, we will reply without weakness,"" he said.

The EU will hold an emergency summit in Brussels.\n\nBut no one promised to move in militarily and defend Ukraine, as it could touch off a major European war.\n\nThe goal instead is to make Moscow pay so high a price by other means that the Kremlin will change course.\n\n""Our mission is clear: Diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,"" Britain\'s Johnson said.\n\nChina, Iran did not condemn invasion\n\nHighlighting a widening rift in superpower relations, China failed to condemn the attack and instead accused the U.S. and its allies of worsening the crisis.\n\nIt put its friendship in practice on Thursday by approving imports of wheat from Russia, a move that could help reduce the impact of possible increased Western sanctions. Russia is one of the world\'s biggest wheat producers, but it would be vulnerable if foreign markets block shipments.\n\nIn defence of Moscow, China ""called on parties to respect others\' legitimate security concerns.""\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that ""all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war"" — language China has consistently used to criticize the West in the crisis.\n\n""Those parties who were busy condemning others, what have they done?

Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that ""this is now an active conflict zone.""\n\nRussia\'s attack and uncertainty about the intensity of the Western response sent stocks tumbling and oil prices surging by more than $5 US per barrel. Market benchmarks in Europe and Asia fell by as much as four per cent, while Brent crude oil briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 on unease about possible disruption of supplies from Russia, the world\'s No. 3 producer.\n\nIn New York, the UN Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nSecretary General Antonio Guterres\'s plea to ""give peace a chance"" came just as Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce the military operation.\n\nTo avoid international civilian casualties, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said that ""there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft"" and that ""the presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes.""\n\nThe invasion has touched all sectors of society across the globe.

The ...', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were designed to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease, not transmission. But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The exchange soon spread widely on social media and on conservative news sites, where it was framed as a bombshell admission by Pfizer.\n\n""Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?"" Roos asked.\n\nAfter two other Parliament members asked questions, Small responded to Roos\' query.\n\n""Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market … no,"" said Small, presumably meaning to say ""transmission"" and not ""immunization."" ""We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.""\n\nThe Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\n""This is scandalous,"" Roos later said in a video he shared on Twitter, arguing that the admonition to ""get vaccinated for others was always a lie."" He also appeared on Fox News on Oct. 11, discussing the exchange with host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBut Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and news reports before the vaccine’s approval were clear that while the vaccine was effective in preventing symptomatic and severe disease, there was no data about whether it stopped transmission to others.\n\nSome may have been surprised at Small’s answer, given public officials’ comments about vaccines and transmission. Both Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said that vaccination can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC in May 2021 changed its guidance on masking, with Fauci saying on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that vaccinated people’s chances of transmitting the virus to others was low. The agency reversed course on that guidance two months later, when it became clear that wasn’t the case with the delta variant.\n\nBut the notion that Pfizer ""admitted"" it didn’t test its vaccine for its ability to stop transmission is incorrect.\n\nAndrew Widger, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said in a statement that details of its phase 3 clinical trial have been online since 2020, and that the trial was never intended to study transmission.\n\nThe phase 3 clinical trial was ""designed and powered"" to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease, Widger said. ""Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,"" he said, which means it wasn’t an outcome being studied.\n\nThe FDA, meanwhile, said in its Dec. 11, 2020, announcement of emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine that there wasn’t yet ""evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person."" A Pfizer press release that same day and another announcing its approval in the European Union on Dec. 21, 2020, made no mention of the vaccine’s effect on transmission.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the outcomes being measured in the original vaccine trials for Pfizer and Moderna were always about their effectiveness against ""symptomatic COVID-19.""\n\n""So, the prevention of transmission (and asymptomatic COVID) were not primary endpoints of these trials and were never a claim of the pharmaceutical companies in developing these vaccines,"" Gandhi said, adding, ""Indeed, this revelation is not new.""\n\nTara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiology professor, agreed, saying the Pfizer executive’s statement was ""not a ‘gotcha.’"" In a December 2020 article for the online website SELF, Smith wrote that the vaccine’s ability to stop transmission was an unanswered question, noting that it’s common in initial vaccine trials for that topic to be addressed in later studies.\n\n""We were hopeful in spring/early summer 2021 that vaccines would be effective against transmission. Delta did change that a bit, making it clear that while vaccines did, and still do, help to reduce one’s risk of infection, they alone are not enough to stop transmission,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That’s why many of us were and remain frustrated at CDC’s messaging around masks, suggesting the vaccinated could stop masking.""\n\nBefore the delta and omicron variants came along, studies suggested that the vaccines were somewhat effective in slowing transmission of the coronavirus.\n\n""In the era before omicron, and to some extent the delta variant, the vaccines clearly were transmission-halting to a high degree,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOnce variants began evading vaccine immunity and breakthrough infections became more common, he added, vaccines were less likely to stop transmission.\n\nWhen Walensky ""said that vaccines decrease transmission and therefore, getting vaccinated protected others, she was providing accurate information to the American public based on data at the time,"" said Gandhi.\n\nIt’s clear that the vaccines are not a firewall against transmission to others, despite misleading claims on two occasions by President Joe Biden that we fact-checked in 2021.\n\nCurrently, Gandhi said, a recent study during the Omicron surge showed that vaccines or prior infection each decreased transmission to others by about 20%.\n\n""The pharmaceutical companies and the CDC both were accurate in terms of their messaging and reporting on the vaccines over time in terms of their ability to reduce transmission and — currently — their incredible ability to reduce severe disease due to the generation of cellular immunity,"" Gandhi said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Instagram post claimed that a Pfizer executive suddenly ""admitted"" that its COVID-19 vaccine had not been tested for preventing transmission before it went to market.\n\nBut this is not a revelation. Pfizer’s clinical trial was always intended to study whether the vaccine prevented recipients from getting symptomatic COVID-19 and whether it prevented severe disease. Pfizer did not claim to have data about transmission of the virus to others.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/05/30/fact-check-claim-misinterprets-data-2021-pfizer-report/9898129002/', 'Headline': 'Fact check: Claim misinterprets data from a 2021 Pfizer report - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities As health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million ...', 'Full_text': 'The claim: A Pfizer trial reports 42,000 adverse events and 1,200 fatalities\n\nAs health care officials continue to urge Americansto get vaccinated and the coronavirus has led to more than 1 million deaths in the U.S., some online posts falsely claim the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine makes people sick and kills them.\n\n""So the leak distracted from the Pfizer dump. 46,000 people took the vaccine in a trial period...42,000 had adverse affects (sic) and 1200 died,"" reads an Instagram post shared May 5.

She then filed a complaint with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was subsequently fired the same day.

The findings were published in an article on November 2, 2021, after the article ""went through...the usual high level legal and editorial oversight and peer review,"" according to the journal.\n\nHowever, by November 10, the journal began receiving complaints from readers unable to share the article on social media.

""Contrary to Pfizer’s public statements, however, the pandemic did not end; it got worse"" in 2021, the complaint reads.\n\n""We are pursuing justice for the people of Texas, many of whom were coerced by tyrannical vaccine mandates to take a defective product sold by lies,"" Paxton said in a press release. ""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2628', 'Headline': 'FDA oversight of clinical trials is “grossly inadequate ... - The BMJ', 'Snippet': 'Covid-19 vaccines and drugs were developed at “warp speed” and now experts are concerned that the US Food and Drug Administration inspected too few clinical trial sites.

Similarly, only 10 out of 99 Moderna trial sites2 and five of 73 remdesivir trial sites3 were inspected.\n\nNow, facing a backlog of site inspections, experts have criticised the FDA’s oversight of clinical trials, describing it as “grossly inadequate.” They say the problem, which predated covid-19, is not limited to a lack of inspections but also includes failing to notify the public or scientific journals when violations are identified—effectively keeping scientific misconduct from the medical establishment.\n\nThe FDA is “endangering public health” by not being candid about violations that are uncovered during clinical trial site inspections, says David Gortler, a pharmacist and pharmacologist who worked as an FDA medical reviewer between 2007 and 2011 and was then appointed as a senior adviser to the FDA commissioner in 2019-21.\n\n“The lack of full transparency and data sharing does not allow physicians and other medical scientists to confirm the data independently and make comprehensive risk-benefit assessments,” continues Gortler, who is now a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington DC.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2381224/judge-scraps-75-year-fda-timeline-to-release-pfizer-vaccine-safety-data-giving-agency-eight-months/', 'Headline': 'Judge scraps 75-year FDA timeline to release Pfizer vaccine safety data ...', 'Snippet': 'Rather than producing 500 pages a month, the FDA’s proposed timeline, Pittman ordered the agency to turn over 55,000 a month.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 4: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44. Over half of American businesses in China either delayed or decreased investments in China due to lockdown measures, according to a recent survey by the local U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThanks to current measures, “China might be seen as a less reliable trading partner than previously,” says Nordin, of Kings College. “The question is how much less reliable than other possible alternatives?”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID U-Turn Reveals Xi Jinping’s Deep Paranoia - TIME', 'Snippet': 'It’s a quite staggering reversal.

On Tuesday, officials announced five deaths from COVID-19—up from two the previous day, which were the first recorded in the country since Dec. 3. On Wednesday, there were officially none. But a glance online tells a different story. Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add1891', 'Headline': 'Zeroing out on zero-COVID | Science - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID helped slow the spread and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/china/who-china-zero-covid-unsustainable-intl-hnk/index.html', 'Headline': 'WHO chief censored on China’s internet after calling zero-Covid ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'China’s zero-tolerance approach of snap lockdowns, mass testing and quarantining has protected the majority of its population from Covid over the past two years, but it has drawn rising dissent ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Down with the World Health Organization!” a top reply said.\n\n“Should the UN’s verified account be blocked this time?” another said.\n\nBy mid-morning, the post was no longer viewable on Weibo “due to the author’s privacy setting.” It is unclear under what circumstances the setting was changed.\n\nA Weibo hashtag of Tedros’ name has also been censored, with images featuring his face being scrubbed from the platform, though posts containing his name are still visible.\n\nOn WeChat, an article from the UN’s official account that included Tedros’ comments has been “banned from sharing due to a violation of relevant laws and regulations” as of Wednesday morning. Video clips of Tedros’ speech have also been removed from the platform.\n\nTedros’ comments, though in line with the assessment of most scientists, have also drawn the ire of Beijing, which called them “irresponsible.”\n\n“We hope relevant people can view China’s epidemic prevention and control policy in an objective and rational way, learn more about the facts and refrain from making irresponsible remarks,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing Wednesday.\n\nChina’s zero-tolerance approach of snap lockdowns, mass testing and quarantining has protected the majority of its population from Covid over the past two years, but it has drawn rising dissent as the lockdowns become more stringent and frequent amid the fast spread of Omicron.\n\nShanghai, the country’s most populous and cosmopolitan city, is reeling from a six-week lockdown that has sparked public outcry, while the capital Beijing has shut schools, restaurants and rolled out frequent mass testing to curb its outbreak. Elsewhere, more local governments are imposing swift lockdowns in response to just a handful of cases.\n\nBut the Chinese leadership has insisted on the strict measures, saying a relaxation will “inevitably lead to large scale infections, a large number of serious illness and deaths” due to the country’s large number of elderly people and insufficient medical resources.\n\nNew modeling by researchers mostly from Shanghai’s Fudan University predicted China could face over 1.5 million Omicron deaths if its zero-Covid measures are lifted without increased vaccine coverage or access to antiviral therapies.\n\nReleased Tuesday by the journal Nature Medicine, the peer-reviewed study found that based on immunity levels as of March, an unchecked Omicron wave would exceed critical care capacity across the country, causing 112.2 million symptomatic cases.\n\nThe research estimates that in the event of an uncontrolled Omicron outbreak, China’s national healthcare system would be completely overwhelmed, with demand for the country’s 64,000 ICU beds outstripping supply 15.6-times over, for a period of at least 44 days.\n\nBut that scenario could be avoided, according to the modeling, if the Chinese government focuses on increasing “accessibility to vaccines and antiviral therapies.”\n\nMore than 88% of Chinese people have been fully vaccinated, but immunization is much lower among the elderly. As of March 17, only half of people aged over 80 in China have been fully vaccinated, and less than 20% of that vulnerable age group have received a booster. Unlike most countries, elderly people were not originally prioritized in China’s vaccination campaigns.\n\nSince the latest outbreak, Chinese officials have vowed to speed up vaccination among the elderly. But in locked-down areas, it is virtually impossible to get vaccinated as residents are confined to their homes and allowed to go out only for Covid testing.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/china/china-zero-covid-impact-beijing-intl-hnk-mic/index.html', 'Headline': 'China scraps virus tracking app as country braces for Covid impact', 'Snippet': 'Beijing CNN —.

Sign up here.\n\nChina is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.\n\nChanges continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.\n\nThe system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.\n\nIt had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.\n\nBut as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.\n\nThroughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.'}}",96.875,1

Yet, on average, UI benefits only replace roughly 40 percent of a worker’s pre-layoff wages. This amount is insufficient to afford basic necessities, particularly for underpaid workers and workers of color who, due to systemic racism, have been segregated into underpaying occupations and have less savings and support to draw from. Underpaid parents and family caregivers are particularly harmed as they generally need to use their full salary to make ends meet. Households with children are much more likely to face housing insecurity when a job is lost.[1] And nondiscretionary expenses, such as childcare, diapers, groceries, and medical prescriptions, are higher for workers caring for dependents. Women of color disproportionately feel the impact of low UI benefit amounts, as they are overrepresented in underpaid jobs and make up a disproportionate share of single-parent households. As a targeted solution, dependent allowances can increase equity and ensure that workers—particularly single mothers of color—can support themselves and their families when they are between jobs.\n\nA dependent allowance provides parents and other caregivers with additional weekly benefits on top of their regular UI based on the number of dependents they claim. As of 2021, there were 13 states with dependent allowances: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. However, there is significant variation among the states in how they define a “dependent” and how they calculate the weekly amount workers receive. In fact, in many states dependent allowances are almost meaningless—certain state legislatures have severely restricted who is considered a dependent, how many dependents a worker can claim, and the amount workers can receive for each dependent.\n\nDefining dependents\n\nCurrent state laws providing for dependent allowances are tailored to meet the needs of the traditional “nuclear family” model and do not recognize the full breadth of caregiving and familial relationships workers experience. Every state with a dependent allowance makes the benefit available to unemployed workers with a child under the age of 18. However, there is some variation in who is considered a child.\n\nAll states except Massachusetts consider a stepchild a dependent, but only 10 states also include adopted children. A couple of states—Iowa and Michigan—use more inclusive definitions of “dependent,” but they only apply under certain circumstances. In Michigan, a parent over the age of 65 or who is permanently disabled from work may be considered a dependent. Similarly, unemployed workers can claim a sibling as a dependent in Michigan, but the sibling must be under 18, orphaned, or have living parents who are also claimed as dependents by the same worker. Similarly, Iowa adopts a more expansive definition, allowing siblings, parents, cousins, and individuals who have lived in their home as a member of their household for a whole year.[2] The state allows spouses to receive a dependent allowance, provided they do not earn more than $120 in gross wages in one week. States will not only look at the familial relationship, but also consider whether the person receives enough financial support to be considered a dependent. Generally, states will require that the person receives at least half of their financial support from the worker to be considered their dependent.\n\nExclusive definitions of “dependent” can disproportionately impact immigrant workers who are more likely to live in multigenerational households and provide care for multiple family members other than, or in addition to, minor children.[3]\n\nCalculating the amount of the dependent allowance\n\nThere is great variety and disparity in how states calculate the amount workers receive as a dependent allowance. Generally, states set a weekly allowance per dependent, either as a fixed sum or as a percentage of their weekly benefit amount (WBA). Massachusetts and New Mexico both offer weekly allowances of $25 per dependent while New Jersey offers 7 percent of a worker’s WBA for their first dependent and 4 percent for each of the next two dependents.\n\nAll states have additional restrictions, such as limiting the amount or type (e.g., child or spouse) of dependents a worker can claim and capping the total amount a worker can receive when the dependent allowance is added to their regular UI benefits. Some states also restrict dependent allowances based on minimum and maximum WBA. These formulas can be especially harmful in states with a low maximum benefit and for underpaid workers receiving the minimum WBA. For example, Ohio offers a sliding scale of $1–$155 in weekly allowance per dependent, with the most low-paid workers can receive being capped at $0, effectively barring them from receiving it, but higher-paid workers can receive up to $155 total per week.\n\nDue to these restrictions, many workers never receive the full amount. These overly restrictive limits dilute the benefit of dependent allowances.\n\nPotential Impact on employers’ experience rating\n\nAs discussed more in depth in our financing and solvency brief, the UI system is “experience rated,” which means that employers are taxed at different rates based on their “experience” with unemployment. Or, in other words, based on the UI benefits paid out to their former employees. This means that generally employers will also be charged for any dependent allowance. However, states can choose to not charge employers for the dependent allowance amount.[4] For example, both Connecticut and New Mexico do not charge employers for the dependent allowance amount. The current health of the state’s trust fund will be a factor in determining whether to charge or not charge employers for the dependent allowance.\n\nFederal Requirements and Guidance\n\nThere are no federal laws related to dependent allowances. States have broad flexibility to decide the benefit amount, who is considered a dependent, and under what conditions workers are eligible for the additional benefit.\n\nIf a state implements a dependent allowance, the additional amount is considered part of a worker’s benefit amount and is subject to the same due process requirements as regular UI benefits. This means states must also provide proper notice and appeal rights.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nDependent allowances offer a targeted way for states to improve equity within the UI system and ensure UI benefits meet the needs of working parents and family caregivers. Yet, few states provide dependent allowances and states with dependent allowances tend to have overly complicated processes and restrictive standards. Below are key policy reforms that can either improve current laws or provide a template for states seeking to enact a dependent allowance. Our suggestions fall into three categories: broad and inclusive dependent definitions, adequate and progressive funding calculations, and improved data collection and reporting. States should:\n\nBroaden and expand dependent definitions. Workers should be able to receive a dependent allowance for all the people they care for and who depend on their income to survive. States should establish simple processes for determining dependents. This would ensure workers can easily understand what they are entitled to and ease administrative burdens for state agencies.\n\nMichigan offers one of the best examples of coverage among the states with dependent allowances. In addition to an expansive definition of dependent children, the state allows spouses, parents over 65 or permanently disabled from gainful employment, siblings (orphaned or whose living parents are dependents, either under 18 or full-time student under the age of 22), and a maximum number of five dependents. However, the state’s benefit amount is too low at just $6 per dependent per week. The following are recommendations for who should be considered dependents when they receive at least half of their financial support[5] from the worker:\n\nNot only biological children but also adoptive, foster, stepchildren, and any other child the worker stands in loco parentis[6]\n\nMinor children (under 18) and those over 18 who are attending full-time school (up to the age of 26).\n\nA person who is 60 years of age or older.\n\nA person over 18 with a physical or mental disability that requires care.\n\nA spouse or domestic partner.\n\nEstablish an adequate and equitable dependent allowance amount. Dependent allowances should reflect parents’ and other caregivers’ real dependent obligations and enable them to meet their financial needs. Thus, there should not be a cap on the number of eligible dependents.\n\nOf the states with dependent allowances, Massachusetts and Illinois offer more generous amounts overall. Massachusetts offers $25 per dependent with a cap of half of the worker’s WBA.[7] Illinois uses a sliding scale of $26–$178, with $26 the maximum dependent allowance for minimum WBAs and $178 the maximum dependent allowance for maximum WBAs.[8]\n\nBelow we provide three options for the dependent allowance amount and its calculation.\n\nOption 1: Flat-rate dollar amount increases annually based on consumer price index. Under this option, the unemployed worker would receive a dependent allowance of a flat dollar amount per dependent—we recommend at least $50. The amount would be increased annually to represent the percent change in the consumer price index published in the preceding year.\n\nOption 2: Percent of the state’s annual average weekly wage. Another option for states is to provide a dependent allowance for each dependent based on a percentage of the state’s average weekly wage. We recommend using a percentage of your state’s average weekly wage that would equate to at least $50 (based on 2021 average weekly wages, this is likely around 4 percent, but should be customized based on your own state’s average weekly wage).\n\nOption 3: Percent of the state’s annual average WBA. Unemployed workers could receive a dependent allowance based on a percentage of the state’s average weekly benefit amount for each dependent. We recommend a percentage of the average weekly benefit amount that would equate to at least $50 (based on 2021 average weekly benefit amounts, this is likely around 25 percent, but should be customized based on your own state’s average weekly benefit amounts).\n\nImprove data collection and reporting. More publicly available data on dependent allowances is crucial for measuring program success and ensuring it meets workers’ needs. States should be collecting and reporting data on the current and total number of workers utilizing a dependent allowance, the average dependent allowance amount, the average number of dependents that workers claim, and the amount and reason for any challenge to a dependent allowance, the basis for the challenge, and outcome of the challenge. This data should be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and income levels.\n\nUse NELP’s dependent allowance model state legislation to help draft a bill to implement many of these policy recommendations. Please note that the process of drafting legislation can vary depending on state-specific legal and policy issues. For example, existing state UI law may use certain terms or phrases that the model language would not reflect. Similarly, different states’ laws may not include all sections in the model state legislation.\n\nResearch Findings and Arguments to Support Reform\n\nDependent allowances support economic growth.\n\nWhile there is limited data available on the impacts of dependent allowances, studies have shown that UI—especially in states that provide livable benefit amounts—leads to faster economic recovery by supporting local and state economies. For example, after the Great Recession, economists found that every $1 of unemployment generated $1.61 for state and local economies;[9] adjusting for inflation, this impact is higher today.\n\nBecause UI benefits only replace a portion of lost wages, dependent allowances provide a crucial level of support for families. Current UI benefit amounts are commonly understood to be far too low. Given the insufficiency of UI, Congress rushed to create a supplemental benefit to support the millions of workers unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) provided workers with an additional $300 per week (initially $600). Recent studies of this expanded pandemic UI program have demonstrated how increased benefits propel economic growth.\n\nAs we described in 7 Things We Learned About Unemployment Insurance During the Pandemic, when some states prematurely ended FPUC, household spending dropped drastically. Specifically, for every dollar of reduced benefits, household spending fell by 52 cents.[10] On average, workers who lost these benefits lost $264 net income per week and spent $145 less per week. The Economic Policy Institute found that the elimination of federal unemployment expansions caused an estimated $144.3 billion of loss in income and a $79.2 billion decline in consumer spending nationwide.[11] The loss of the federal expansions also slowed national gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of 2021, according to the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis.[12]\n\nDependent allowances are an anti-poverty tool.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, two-thirds of working mothers were breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families. Mothers of color and women in low-wage jobs are most likely to be the breadwinners for their families and less likely to be co-breadwinners.[13] Because of structural racism and sexism in the labor market, women—especially women of color—are often in precarious, inflexible, and underpaying work, causing more frequent and longer unemployment spells, which in turn leads to more barriers to employment.[14] For those who are even eligible for UI, many women will receive unemployment benefits that only replace a small portion of lost wages. Dependent allowances are crucial for filling in these gaps and supporting families.\n\nAs we have argued in a previous report, dependent allowances are a powerful anti-poverty tool. Households with children are much more likely to face food and housing insecurities when a job is lost. Even before the COVID-19 economic crisis, nearly 1 in 10 children in America lived in deep poverty, although that figure was closer to 1 in 5 for Black children, largely because of systemic racism.[15] Black and Latinx households endure pay disparities, leaving many struggling with less savings to rely on in times of crisis.[16] When surveyed, many households have indicated that UI is a key income source during times of crisis.\n\nAlthough a worker’s employment situation may temporarily change, their financial commitments do not. Many caregivers have financial needs such as rent, car payments, childcare, tuition, diapers, groceries, student loans, medical prescriptions, and more. These commitments, combined with inadequate UI benefits, can be even more challenging, especially for many single-parent households, compounding an already difficult economic situation.\n\nDependent allowances can help create an equitable labor market.\n\nAdequate UI benefits can increase or retain caregivers’ workforce participation while allowing workers to maintain vital supports. Caregiving challenges and shortages are cited as a top reason for reduced labor-force participation, especially among mothers.[17] In this environment of inaccessible care, Black and Latina women are most significantly impacted by having to shift to part-time work or leave employment completely.[18] Data shows that in times of crisis, mothers of children under five and single mothers are most vulnerable, with many leaving the workforce, struggling to reenter, and experiencing a “lifetime of consequences.”[19] Although women’s labor-force participation is steadily increasing, we risk losing progress without serious policy interventions. While communities grapple with safe, accessible, and affordable care shortages, dependent allowances can help caregivers maintain their care arrangements while they search for employment or if they are temporarily working part-time.\n\nData and State Comparison Resources\n\nAs of June 2022, there is no national dependent allowance data available, as states are not required to report dependent allowance data to the US Department of Labor (USDOL). Rather, dependent allowances are reported as part of a worker’s WBA. If your state has a dependent allowance, you can check your state labor department website to see if they report any data. If the data is not publicly reported, you may be able to request data from the state agency through a public records request.\n\nCompare state dependent allowances.\n\nConsult USDOL’s annual Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws Chapter 3-20 for detailed comparisons of states’ dependent allowances, including:\n\nThe current state definitions of a dependent (Table 3-9)\n\nThe amount of various state dependent allowances (Table 3-10)\n\nFor an overview chart of key statistics on state UI programs, including quick comparisons of each state’s WBA, see USDOL’s annual Significant Provisions of UI State Laws. Both of these resources are updated annually, so table references may change.\n\nEvaluate your state’s Benefit Accuracy Measurement data.\n\nTo learn the amount of dependent allowance overpayments, you can view your state’s Benefit Accuracy Measurement data. Check your state labor agency website or USDOL’s website. This data includes fraud and agency error. Nationally, dependent allowances have the lowest overpayment rate.\n\nUnderstand your state’s household economic conditions.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts a variety of surveys to understand economic conditions, including the Current Population Survey and the Census Household Pulse survey, which measures household experiences including food, housing, and childcare security.\n\nCalculate the cost of living in your state.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute’s Family Budget Calculator is a helpful tool for breaking down the average cost of living (including childcare expenses) in a city by household type and size. This can demonstrate the need for increased dependent allowances.\n\nUnderstand economic impacts by demographics.\n\nTo view national or state unemployment rates by race and ethnicity, Economic Policy Institute offers a quarterly breakdown. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases national monthly Employment Situation data, including a breakdown by race and sex.\n\nReferences and Essential Articles\n\nDependent allowances\n\nJosh Bivens et al., Reforming Unemployment Insurance: Section 5 Benefit Levels, Center for American Progress, Center for Popular Democracy, Economic Policy Institute, Groundwork Collaborative, National Employment Law Project, National Women’s Law Center, and Washington Center for Equitable Growth, July 2021, starting at 90, https://www.nelp.org/publication/reforming-unemployment-insurance-stabilizing-a-system-in-crisis-and-laying-the-foundation-for-equity/.\n\nInequities in unemployment\n\nMonée Fields-White, Vivian Graubard, Alberto Rodríguez, Nikki Zeichner, and Cassandra Robertson, Unpacking Inequities in Unemployment Insurance, New America, September 17, 2020, https://www.newamerica.org/pit/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/unemployment-insurance-isnt-enough-to-keep-the-family-fed.\n\nBenefit amounts fail to cover basic household expenses\n\nLiz Hipple and Alix Gould-Werth, Weak Income Support Infrastructure Harms U.S. Workers and Their Families and Constrains Economic Growth, Washington Center for Equitable Growth, August 5, 2021, https://equitablegrowth.org/weak-income-support-infrastructure-harms-u-s-workers-and-their-families-and-constrains-economic-growth/.\n\nAdditional talking points for expanding dependent coverage\n\nFact Sheet: The Importance of Inclusive, Realistic Family Definitions for Paid Leave, A Better Balance: Recognizing All Families, June 21, 2022, https://www.abetterbalance.org/our-issues/recognizing-all-families/.\n\n[1] Brynne Keith-Jennings, Catlin Nchako, and Joseph Llobrera, “Number of Families Struggling to Afford Food Rose Steeply in Pandemic and Remains High, Especially Among Children and Households of Color,” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, April 27, 2021, https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/number-of-families-struggling-to-afford-food-rose-steeply-in-pandemic-and.\n\n[2] See Iowa Admin.

Investing in MAP grants rather than spending more on public pensions could make a difference.\n\nIn January 2022, the unemployment rate for prime working-age Black Illinoisans was 11.1% compared to just 6.1% on average in the United States, according to data from the Current Population Survey. The unemployment rate of white Illinoisans was nearly at the U.S. average for white Americans. Furthermore, the gap between whites and Blacks in Illinois was almost 8 percentage points.\n\nAttributing this gap to racial discrimination would be misleading because it does not account for other factors that are linked to employment. For example, if white workers live closer to cities where the jobs are located, or if they have higher levels of education on average, then we would expect white workers to find themselves unemployed less often than Black workers.\n\nWhen we compare similar individuals, we learn Black Illinoisans are 6 percentage points less likely to be employed than white Illinoisans. The U.S. average racial employment gap between Black and white Americans is 2.2 percentage points for job seekers.\n\nIllinois’ unemployment gap predates the pandemic\n\nIn 2019, while the U.S. economy was thriving and the national Black unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time ever, Illinois’ Black unemployment rate stood at 7%. Even then, there was no difference between white unemployment rates in Illinois and the U.S. average. The gap between the Illinois’ Black unemployment rate and the average unemployment rate of Black Americans already existed.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately hurt the employment chances of Black workers compared to white workers, the gap increased even more for Black Illinoisans than other Black Americans.\n\nBad economic times disproportionately hurt Black workers more than white workers\n\nHistorically, Black workers have faced a comparatively higher risk of job loss at the first sign of economic downturn. A tight labor market tends to reduce the racial and ethnic unemployment gaps. This is because stiffer competition for workers among employers raises the cost of discrimination.\n\nIn 2021, there were on average 1.1 job openings for every job seeker in the U.S. Illinois barely managed 0.9 job openings per job seeker. That’s less than one job per job seeker, meaning there weren’t nearly enough jobs for unemployed Illinoisans.\n\nA tighter labor market could help improve outcomes for Illinois’ Black population. Higher job opening rates and persistent labor shortages in other states are contributing to more Blacks finding work in those states.\n\nLonger unemployment durations for Black workers will do lasting damage to Illinois’ economy because higher joblessness among Black Illinoisans represents lost production, forgone investments and reduced economic potential.\n\nHow to spur job creation in Illinois\n\nResearch shows labor market institutions affect job creation and productivity growth. Labor market institutions that favor growth include portable pension and health insurance plans, and individualized and flexible wage-setting.\n\nThe evidence supports that limiting government intervention in labor markets and constraints on government union collective bargaining agreements lead to higher employment opportunities and higher productivity growth.\n\nIllinois has the third-highest regulatory burden in the U.S., which means there are higher costs associated with forming businesses and creating jobs.\n\nIllinois is also highly unionized, and cumbersome public-sector collective bargaining agreements, as well as the state’s constitutional public employee pension protection, mean spending and tax policy cannot quickly adapt to reflect changing economic conditions.\n\nThe state’s constitutional public employee retirement protection has already resulted in skyrocketing pension costs, crowding out core government services and other necessary investments.\n\nFor example, the state could do more to close skills gaps by expanding its Monetary Award Program grants that are available to Illinois residents with financial needs.\n\nMost MAP grant recipients are low-income Black or Hispanic students whose parents never graduated from college.\n\nResearch shows an additional $2,000 in MAP grants increases the likelihood the recipient finishes a 4-year degree by 4 percentage points. MAP grants also raise the annual wages of recipients after graduation.\n\nAlthough MAP grant recipients receive on average 25% more funding than they did 20 years ago, MAP spending as a share of general funds expenditures has decreased.\n\nThis election year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker is proposing to increase MAP funding by 36%. While this a step in the right direction, it is still $42.4 million short of what MAP spending would have been had the program’s share of government spending remained at its fiscal year 2001 level.\n\nThe economic cost of racial and ethnic inequality\n\nGovernment spending not only reveals politicians’ true priorities, but it also has consequences for the state’s economy. Investments that help to close racial gaps in labor market outcomes should be the priority because these persistent gaps in opportunity come with a huge economic price tag – not just for those who are being sidelined, but for all Illinoisans.\n\nResearch shows racial and ethnic inequalities have cost the U.S. economy $51 trillion in lost economic output in the past 30 years. From labor alone, the losses add up to $22.9 trillion since 1990.\n\nAlthough racial unemployment gaps in the labor market persist, investments in Black students and workers coupled with policies that lower barriers to entry and reward productive market activity will be the first steps toward improving the lives of Black Illinoisans.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/illinois/', 'Headline': 'Economy of Illinois Statistics and Data Trends: GDP ranking ...', 'Snippet': 'The latest data shows that Illinois has a higher unemployment rate than the US overall.

If you’re trying to make child support payments while looking for a job, it can be especially stressful.\n\nYou may be wondering how you will pay child support while unemployed and how this will affect your existing order. A job loss doesn’t change your child support obligations.\n\nTo do that, you must file to modify your child support payments. If you’re facing this situation, it’s important to know your legal rights.\n\nHere are the facts on unemployment and child support.\n\nUnemployment and Child Support\n\nIf you’ve recently lost your job, you may wonder if you have to pay child support while you’re unemployed.\n\nThe answer is a definite “yes.” Your financial obligations do not change or end if your job status changes. You’re still expected to honor your child support order and pay each month.\n\nWhen you miss a payment, you still owe that amount plus interest. If you get behind on your payments, you could incur additional fees or even jail time.\n\nThe courts are not favorable to someone who evades their financial responsibility to their child, whether it’s intentional or not.\n\nReason for Unemployment\n\nThe reason you are unemployed is important if you hope to modify your child support payments. If you left your job without another job in place, your voluntary departure prevents you from receiving a modification of your payment amount.\n\nYou can only seek a modification if your unemployment is a result of a sudden or involuntary circumstance.\n\nChild Support Modification\n\nIf you’re unemployed and can’t make your normal child support payments, you can request an adjustment to your current child support order. The court bases new child support amounts on your ability to find a similar paying job.\n\nThey use your past employment record as a benchmark to determine your potential future earnings. The court refers to this amount as “imputed income.”\n\nThe dollar amount depends on a parent’s opportunity, ability, willingness to work, and earning capacity. This is based on skill set, education, past jobs, and other relevant information.\n\nWhen the unemployed parent is seeking another job and willing to work, the court makes an educated guess regarding future salary and then sets the imputed amount. If the court finds insufficient evidence, they may impute the child support amount to minimum wage.\n\nEach child support case is unique and based on the parents’ particular circumstances. When a non-custodial parent falls on difficult financial times, they should inform the court right away.\n\nYou cannot change the amount of child support you pay without seeking a modification. You should contact a qualified family law attorney to help you file a modification. The sooner you start the process, the better.\n\nChild Support and Unemployment Benefits\n\nFirst, if you are unemployed, find out if you qualify for unemployment benefits in your state. Be upfront about your outstanding child support payments.\n\nIf you’re eligible for unemployment benefits, the state can deduct child support payments from your benefits. If you’re ineligible for benefits because you are underemployed or avoiding employment, the court will defer to your imputed income to calculate child support payments.\n\nThe court strongly recommends that individuals with child support obligations find a job and communicate with the court while seeking employment. Once you gain employment, continue your child support payments until they can be deducted from your wages.\n\nYour payment amount may increase to account for the time you were unemployed.\n\nWork With the Court\n\nIf you feel your child support payments are too high for what you’re earning, don’t ignore the problem. The court will expect proof that your financial circumstances have changed and you cannot afford to pay the same amount.\n\nIt’s best to stay as current as possible on your child support payments and continue to work with the court for a resolution. Child support and child custody are typically based on what’s in the best interest of the child.\n\nDefaulting on child support payments can have long-term consequences. It’s important to be proactive if you lose your job or find yourself unable to pay your monthly child support payment.\n\nGet Legal Help\n\nIf you’re facing unemployment, you may find it hard to make ends meet, including paying child support. When you can no longer meet your child support obligations, it’s in your best interest to contact a qualified family law attorney as soon as possible.\n\nA family law attorney understands the complexities of family law, child custody, and child support. Your attorney can help you file for a modification of a child support order.\n\nNo one should have to face the hardships of unemployment and the worries of providing for their child alone. Your attorney can help you understand your rights and navigate the legal process regarding paying child support while unemployed.\n\nFind a Family Law Attorney Near You\n\nBeing unemployed is a difficult dilemma to face. When you have child support obligations to meet, it only compounds a stressful situation.\n\nLosing your job or facing a reduction in pay does not affect a child support order. You’re expected to pay the same amount unless the court grants a modification.\n\nFacing a loss of income and mounting child support payments can be scary and overwhelming. A family law attorney can help you understand the laws regarding unemployment and child support and help you find the best resolution for you and your child.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/topic/illinois-income/', 'Headline': 'Illinois Income Statistics to Know in 2024 - Neilsberg', 'Snippet': 'In Illinois, the population consists of 6.33 million males (49.39%) and 6.49 million females (50.61%).

The median household income, in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars, was $77,287 in 2012 and $83,346 in 2022.\n\nIn Illinois, the median household income for the households where the householder is Black or African American increased by $3,918(9.53%), between 2012 and 2022. The median household income, in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars, was $41,101 in 2012 and $45,019 in 2022.\n\nRead more about Illinois median household income by race ➔\n\nYear by year\n\nIllinois median household income trends by year, family type and household size (2010-2021):\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, the median household income for Illinois increased by $3,232 (4.30%), as per the American Community Survey estimates.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2021, median household income, adjusted for 2022 inflation, experienced growth year by year for 7 years and declined for 4 years.\n\nThe most significant year-by-year growth occured from 2019 to 2020, when the median household income increased by 1,888 (from $75,651 to $77,539). Similarly the most substantial year-by-year decline occured from 2010 to 2011, when the median household income decreased by 1,225 (from $75,202 to $73,977).\n\nIt then further increased to $115,980 for 7-person households, the largest household size for which the bureau reported a median household income.\n\nWith a Gini coefficient of 0.4837, it is evident that income distribution in Illinois exihibits characterstics of moderate inequality .\n\nFor the family households, the median income (in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars) was $96,948.

However, prosecutors later dropped the charges against her.\n\nBabbitt was killed during the Capitol riot, where she was seen wearing a Donald Trump flag as a cape.

He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever. But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them.""

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.

Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.

That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter.

I miss her every day,” Micki Witthoeft said through tears as members of Congress gathered inside to remember the first anniversary of the attacks.\n\n“I’m here because Americans do have the right to protest, it’s your right as an American citizen to protest,” she continued.\n\nBabbitt, a 36-year-old Air Force veteran, was shot by US Capitol Police officer Lt. Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process. Most of them veterans, who fought for their right to be in this country, to exercise their First Amendment right to protest — and they are being denied the rights they fought for,” she said.\n\nAs Congress marked the anniversary with a moment of silence and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered speeches, a few supporters of the Jan. 6 effort gathered nearby.\n\nKeith Scott, who described himself as a proud Capitol rioter, traveled to DC from Corpus Christi, Texas, to observe the anniversary.\n\n“It was the greatest day of my life,” he said as he stood near the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the base of Capitol Hill.\n\n“I felt like a patriot – like a patriot before the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and I still feel that way.”\n\nBut he said he was disappointed the anniversary didn’t draw other supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n“Loyal Trump supporters are worn out,” he said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.wjhl.com/news/politics/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

An Executive Summary[7] of the committee\'s findings was published on December 19, 2022; a Final Report[8] was published on December 22, 2022.[9]\n\nDuring the first hearing on June 9, 2022, committee chair Bennie Thompson and vice-chair Liz Cheney said that President Donald Trump tried to stay in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election. Thompson called it a ""coup"".[10] The committee shared footage of the attack, discussed the involvement of the Proud Boys, and included testimony from a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Capitol Police.\n\nThe second hearing on June 13, 2022, focused on evidence showing that Trump knew he lost and that most of his inner circle knew claims of fraud did not have merit. William Barr testified that Trump had ""become detached from reality"" because he continued to promote conspiracy theories and pushed the stolen election myth without ""interest in what the actual facts were.""[11][12]\n\nThe third hearing on June 16, 2022, examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to selectively discount electoral votes and overturn the election by unconstitutional means, using John Eastman\'s fringe legal theories as justification.[13]\n\nThe fourth hearing on June 21, 2022, included appearances by election officials from Arizona and Georgia who testified they were pressured to ""find votes"" for Trump and change results in their jurisdictions. The committee revealed attempts to organize fake slates of alternate electors and established that ""Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort.""[14][15]\n\nThe fifth hearing on June 23, 2022, focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign on the Justice Department to rubber stamp his narrative of a stolen election, the insistence on numerous debunked election fraud conspiracy theories, requests to seize voting machines, and Trump\'s effort to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.[16]\n\nThe exclusive witness of the sixth hearing on June 28, 2022, was Cassidy Hutchinson, top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[17] She testified that White House officials anticipated violence days in advance of January 6; that Trump knew supporters at the Ellipse rally were armed with weapons including AR-15s yet asked to relax security checks at his speech; and that Trump planned to join the crowd at the Capitol and became irate when the Secret Service refused his request. Closing the hearing, Cheney presented evidence of witness tampering.[18]\n\nThe seventh hearing on July 12, 2022, showed how Roger Stone and Michael Flynn connected Trump to domestic militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys that helped coordinate the attack.[19][20][21]\n\nThe eighth hearing on July 21, 2022, presented evidence and details of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack on the Capitol, despite hours of pleas from officials and insiders. According to the New York Times, the committee delivered two significant public messages: Rep. Liz Cheney made the case that Trump could never ""be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again"", while Rep. Bennie Thompson called for legal ""accountability"" and ""stiff consequences"" to ""overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy.""[22]\n\nThe ninth hearing on October 13, 2022,[23][24] presented video of Roger Stone and evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] The committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony,[27][28] and a subpoena was issued one week later.[29] Trump refused to comply.[30]\n\nThe tenth hearing on December 19, 2022, convened to present a final overview of their investigative work to date, and the committee recommended that former President Donald Trump, John Eastman, and others be referred for legal charges. The committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (CA), Rep. Jim Jordan (OH), Scott Perry (PA), and Andy Biggs (AZ) refusing to answer subpoenas.[31] The votes were unanimous.[32] Immediately after the hearing, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its findings.[33][34][35]\n\nSchedule\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly in the investigation, the committee held a preliminary hearing in 2021. It was only carried by C-SPAN and not widely covered on broadcast television.[3] In June 2022, the committee held highly publicized hearings intended for live broadcast.[36] As used by the committee, labels such as ""first hearing"", ""second hearing"", et cetera refers to this series of televised hearings.\n\nThe committee publicly voted on December 19, 2022,[37] to make criminal referrals for Donald Trump and John Eastman to the DOJ, and ethics referrals for four members of Congress (Representatives McCarthy, Jordan, Biggs, and Perry) to the House Ethics Committee.[38] (The news had previously identified Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, and Rudy Giuliani as likely to be referred.)[39][40] The committee released its final report on December 22, which became a bestseller.\n\nHearing schedule TV series number Date Day Time (ET) Video Transcript Untelevised July 27, 2021 Tuesday 9:30 A.M.

This messaging presented a challenge for them, in part because they did not know in advance what information the committee would reveal at the hearings.[68][69] McCarthy spoke to donors on the morning of the second hearing, advising Republicans to ignore the proceedings, refuse public comment and avoid the topic. He suggested their party should instead discuss election issues that could garner more votes, such as focusing on rising inflation or fuel prices. Insiders have said former president Trump was not necessarily pleased with this strategy and felt there was ""no one to defend"" him.[70]\n\nPreliminary hearing – July 27, 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\n(D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nOfficer Harry Dunn – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Michael Fanone – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\nSergeant Aquilino Gonell – United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC\n\nOfficer Daniel Hodges – Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSynopsis of preliminary hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 27, 2021, the committee held a hearing titled ""The Law Enforcement Experience on January 6th [2021]"".[42][71]\n\nAccording to C-SPAN, ""January 6 Committee Meeting with Capitol and D.C.

The committee showed never-before-seen footage of the Capitol attack to provide an accessible and compelling narrative of events for the public.[87]\n\nOpening statements by the panel members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee panel observed that Donald Trump attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy.[88][89] According to Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, ""Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan. 6, to overthrow the government ... The violence was no accident. It represents Trump\'s last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power."" According to the committee, Trump ""lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president.""[88][89]\n\nPanel members made reference to a federal district court opinion in which the Judge David O. Carter said Trump had ""likely"" violated two federal statutes and staged a ""coup in search of a legal theory"".[90][91] Rep Liz Cheney read part of the opinion, in which the court said:\n\nIf Dr. Eastman and President Trump\'s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.[92]\n\nCheney urged all Americans to read the opinion in full. Cheney said Trump\'s efforts were part of a ""sophisticated seven-part plan"", which the committee hearings would establish.[93]\n\nThe Trump administration\'s seven-part plan to overturn the 2020 election, according to the January 6 Committee[93][94]\n\n1. Trump had knowledge that he lost the 2020 election but spread misinformation to the American public and made false statements claiming significant voter fraud led to his defeat;\n\n2. Trump planned to remove and replace the Attorney General and Justice Department officials in an effort to force the DOJ to support false allegations of election fraud;\n\n3. Trump pressured Vice President Pence to refuse certified electoral votes in the official count on January 6, in violation of the U.S. Constitution;\n\n4. Trump pressured state lawmakers and election officials to alter election results in his favor;\n\n5. Trump\'s legal team and associates directed Republicans in seven states to produce and send fake ""alternate"" electoral slates to Congress and the National Archives;\n\n6. Trump summoned and assembled a destructive mob in Washington and sent them to march on the U.S. Capitol; and\n\n7. Trump ignored multiple requests to speak out in real time against the mob violence, refused to instruct his supporters to disband, and failed to take any immediate actions to halt attacks on the Capitol.\n\nA written version of the above plan was released after the hearing.[94][95]\n\nTrump knew that he lost\n\n[edit]\n\nMany in Trump\'s inner circle informed the president he had lost and there was no evidence of widespread fraud. According to several video clips of prior testimony shown by the committee:\n\nA senior adviser to the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, testified that Trump was internally advised he had lost the election. According to Miller, the campaign\'s top data aide, Matt Oczkowski, told Trump very shortly after the election ""in pretty blunt terms, that he was going to lose"".[96]\n\nTrump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon testified he had spoken to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in November 2020 soon after the election and told Meadows there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. According to Cannon, Meadows replied: ""So there\'s no there there.""[97]\n\nAccording to his testimony, attorney general Bill Barr ""said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were \'bullshit\'"".[97]\n\nIvanka Trump said she ""accepted"" Barr\'s assessment.[97]\n\nRush to issue presidential pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nCheney observed White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of lawyers had threatened to resign in response to an increasingly hostile climate of lawless activity within the Oval Office. Another video clip was then shown in which Jared Kushner characterized Cipollone\'s concerns as ""whining."" During his testimony, Kushner claimed that his primary ""interest at that time"" was to complete as many presidential pardons as possible.[98] Cheney also said that Representative Scott Perry and other Republican members of Congress had ""sought Presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.""[44]\n\nAttack on the Capitol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe committee showed video, much of it never before seen by the public, of the mob charging the Capitol and battling police. The video began with scenes of roughly 200 Proud Boys leading the assault on the Capitol. As later scenes showed a violent rampage, audio was overlaid of Trump later saying, ""The love in the air. I\'ve never seen anything like it."" As the attack lasted several hours, the video contained timestamps to illustrate the timeline.[99] Documentary filmmaker Nick Quested provided testimony during the live hearing; he was embedded with the Proud Boys on January 6. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also testified live and in-person; she was seriously injured[100] on January 6 while defending the Capitol against initial attacks by Proud Boys and during the mob violence that followed.[101]\n\nQuested testified that he joined the Proud Boys at the National Mall at 10:30 a.m., saying ""I don\'t know if violence was a plan, but I do know that they weren\'t there to attend the rally because they had already left the rally by the time the president had started his speech."" According to Quested, they then walked around the Capitol while taking some pictures and observed a sole police officer at the barricades by the Peace Circle.[44] After suggesting the Proud Boys were doing reconnaissance to spot security weaknesses, Chairman Thompson observed that the Proud Boys chose that barricade and breached it at about the same time President Trump directed the rally attendees to march to that same location. He then said:\n\nNow a central question is whether the attack on the Capitol was coordinated and planned. What you witnessed is what a coordinated and planned effort would look like. It was the culmination of a months\' long effort spearheaded by President Trump.[44]\n\nOfficer Edwards, who had sustained multiple injuries during the attack, testified that the group of Proud Boys who first approached the police barricades began by shouting rhetoric to turn the police into ""villains"" and then began their assault. She described in detail her experiences and injuries as police fell back. When asked what she remembers most vividly, Edwards described moving from an area with a relatively small field of view to one where she had her first view of the events unfolding before the Western Terrace.\n\nWhen I fell behind that line and I saw, I can just remember my—my breath catching in my throat, because what I saw was just a—a war scene. It was something like I\'d seen out of the movies. I—I couldn\'t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up ... Never in my wildest dreams did I think that, as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know, I—I\'m trained to detain, you know, a couple of subjects and—and handle—you know, handle a crowd, but I—I\'m not combat trained.""[44]\n\nPence called for the National Guard\n\n[edit]\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, in videotaped testimony, said the White House encouraged him to claim that Trump had ordered the National Guard to respond on January 6, even though it was Pence who in fact gave the order.[97] Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted on January 6 that former President Trump had ""directed"" the National Guard to respond.[102] The reasons that the White House attempted to falsely credit Trump for National Guard mobilization remains unclear.[103]\n\nIt was always known that Pence gave the order. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had publicly stated so on the day of the attack. As a result, CNN later questioned whether Pence was ""acting as commander in chief.""[102] Miller gave similar testimony to Congress on May 12, 2021, before the House select committee was formed.[104]\n\nSecond hearing – June 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nKevin Marino – attorney for Bill Stepien\n\nChris Stirewalt – former Fox News Political Editor\n\nBenjamin Ginsberg – election attorney, counsel to the George W.

J. Pak testified. Pak resigned from his position days before the January 6 attack; he later told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the White House informed him Trump would fire him if he did not publicly state his office had found election fraud in Georgia.[131][132]\n\nChris Stirewalt, a former Fox News politics editor, testified. Fox News was the first network to declare Biden as having won Arizona in the 2020 election; Stirewalt testified that as the vote count wrapped up, he saw Trump\'s statistical chances of winning shrink to essentially zero. After Stirewalt defended that journalistic choice, Fox News fired him in January 2021.[133][134]\n\nAl Schmidt, the Republican former city commissioner of Philadelphia, testified. He had drawn Trump\'s ire for refusing to publicly announce the city\'s election results were rife with fraud. He resigned in 2021, saying he had received death threats.[131]\n\nBen Ginsberg, a long-term Republican election attorney involved in the controversial Bush v. Gore litigation, testified as an expert about why Trump\'s election lawsuits failed.[135]\n\nSubpoena and absence of Bill Stepien\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Stepien was subpoenaed to testify, but his wife went into labor and he canceled his appearance;[133] his attorney was then to have read a statement on his behalf, but did not.[136] Stepien is a longtime Republican operative who joined Trump\'s 2016 campaign, later becoming the White House political director, before becoming Trump\'s campaign manager two months before the 2020 election. He was involved in the Stop the Steal effort, including spreading false information about voting machines despite a staff memo finding the allegations were false. Stepien had provided the committee a deposition under subpoena in December 2021.[137][138] The Select Committee made ten video clips of Stepien\'s deposition available following the meeting.[109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116][117][118]\n\nKnowledgeable insiders dismiss voter fraud allegations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Select Committee showed several video clips of White House and Trump campaign insiders patly dismissing claims of voter fraud.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said Rudy Giuliani was ""definitely intoxicated"" on election night when he advised Trump to lie that he had won.[139]\n\nTrump campaign staffer Bill Stepien said he disagreed with Giuliani\'s advice on this matter: ""Ballots were still being counted. It was far too early to be making any proclamation like that.""[139] Stepien said that Trump\'s advisers fell into two camps on this matter, and Stepien considered himself to be on ""Team Normal"".[140]\n\nMore video of Barr\'s testimony was presented. At times he could not control his laughter at the absurdity of some fraud allegations, such as the ""Italygate"" conspiracy theory, which claims that satellites controlled from Italy had been compromised and used to attack voting machines, and that former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez had orchestrated an election fraud scheme, despite having died seven years earlier. Barr testified Trump never gave ""an indication of interest in what the actual facts were,"" adding the president had ""become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff."" Barr also laughed at the mention of Dinesh D\'Souza\'s recent film 2000 Mules, dismissing the fictional assertions of widespread election fraud.[141][142]\n\nFalse claims appeared in Trump fundraising\n\n[edit]\n\nCommittee member Zoe Lofgren and the Select Committee\'s senior investigative counsel Amanda Wick described how Trump used false claims of election fraud by a ""left-wing mob"" to solicit donations for an ""Official Election Defense Fund"" beginning days after the election. The solicitation raised some $250 million in total, nearly $100 million in the first week. Lofgren noted most election-related litigation had ended within weeks of the election, yet the requests for cash contributions continued. Reuters analysis of the legal language of the email solicitations days after they began showed that donors were asked to register for recurring donations and that donations under $8,000 would not go into a defense fund, but rather to Trump\'s Save America PAC and to the Republican National Committee, which would have broad discretion over the funds. Lofgren asserted, ""Not only was there the big lie, there was the big rip-off."" Lofgren later said on CNN that the committee had evidence that members of Trump\'s family and inner circle had personally benefited from the post-election fundraising, specifically stating that Kimberly Guilfoyle had been paid $60,000 for delivering a 21⁄2 minute introduction at the Stop the Steal rally, though that fee was paid by Turning Point Action.[143][144][145][146]\n\nThird hearing – June 16, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nPete Aguilar – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 31st district)\n\nGreg Jacob – former Counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nJ.

Pence himself was not present at the hearing and did not offer video testimony.[13]\n\nExperts testimony on the Constitutional role of the Vice President in the election\n\n[edit]\n\nJ. Michael Luttig, a longtime Republican who had clerked for Antonin Scalia and Warren Burger before becoming a federal appeals court judge, testified in-person.[169] Had Pence ""obeyed the orders from his president,"" it ""would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis,"" he said.[170]\n\nBefore the hearing, Luttig wrote a statement for the record that Trump and his allies ""instigated"" a war on democracy ""so that he could cling to power."" He continued, ""It is breathtaking that these arguments even were conceived, let alone entertained by the President of the United States at that perilous moment in history"" and that January 6 ""was the final fateful day for the execution of a well-developed plan by the former president to overturn the 2020 presidential election at any cost."" On the day before the Capitol attack, Luttig had—at the request of Pence\'s aides—publicly opined that the vice president had no constitutional authority to intervene in the election certification, which Pence cited in his January 6 letter stating he would not intervene.[171][172]\n\nGreg Jacob, former counsel to Pence, testified in-person. He had advised Pence he did not have the authority to overturn the election results.[13] In his legal opinion, he said, those who wrote the Constitution wouldn\'t have ""put it in the hands of one person to determine who would be the president of the United States"".[170] He also said that John Eastman had told him privately that he didn\'t expect a single Supreme Court Justice would support the validity of the fake electors scheme.[173]\n\nA video was shown of testimony by Marc Short, former Pence chief of staff.[170] According to Short, Pence knew he had no legal authority to overturn the election and had said so ""many times"" to Trump.[174]\n\nNarrative of Vice President Pence and the events of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer White House lawyer Eric Herschmann had told the committee that Rudy Giuliani privately admitted on the morning of January 6 that Pence didn\'t have authority to overturn the election, even though Giuliani gave a speech at the Ellipse that afternoon telling the opposite to the crowd. Herschmann\'s videotaped testimony was publicly revealed for the first time.[175]\n\nAccording to a timeline presented by the committee, by 2:10 pm the Capitol had been breached and the mob began swarming in. Trump became aware of the breach and at 2:24 pm tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what was necessary."" The committee revealed that the mob, some chanting ""hang Mike Pence,"" came within 40 feet (12 m) of the vice president as he was evacuated from his office to an underground loading dock. Greg Jacob testified the Secret Service instructed Pence and his aides to get in cars, which most did; Pence declined, and the head of his security detail assured the vice president he would not be evacuated from the Capitol without his permission. Pence responded that he knew and trusted his security chief, but that he was not the one driving the car. Jacob said Pence did not want the world seeing him fleeing and giving the insurgents any satisfaction from it. Pence then spent the next five hours in a secure underground location within the Capitol Building complex. The Department of Justice spoke to a confidential witness who traveled to Washington with the Proud Boys and swore under oath that they would have killed Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi if given the chance.[176][170][177]\n\nThe committee alleged that Eastman was aware his ""coup memo"" and other legal recommendations and political activities were potentially criminal. He emailed Trump\'s former attorney Rudy Giuliani several days after the attack on the Capitol, saying, ""I\'ve decided I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works"", but he did not receive a pardon.[170] During his taped deposition, he pleaded the Fifth 100 times—reserving the right to avoid self-incrimination—and refused to answer any questions regarding his participation in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[178][179]\n\nLuttig warns about 2024\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the close of the hearing, Luttig said:\n\nDonald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy. They would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election, but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020. I don\'t speak those words lightly. I would have never spoken those words ever in my life, except that that\'s what the former president and his allies are telling us ... [that they] are executing that blueprint for 2024 in the open, in plain view of the American public.[180][181]\n\nFourth hearing – June 21, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Schiff – Committee Member, Representative (D-CA 28th district)\n\nRusty Bowers – Speaker of the Arizona State House of Representatives\n\nBrad Raffensperger – Georgia Secretary of State\n\nGabriel Sterling – Chief Operating Officer in the Georgia Secretary of State Office\n\nWandrea ""Shaye"" Moss – employee of the Department of Registration and Elections in Fulton County, Georgia, from 2017 until 2022\n\n""Lady"" Ruby Freeman – mother of Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, present in person but heard via pre-recorded testimony\n\nJosh Roselman – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nCasey Lucier – investigative counsel for the Select Committee\n\nWilliam Barr – former Attorney General\n\nB.

The committee presented part of a video deposition of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who testified Trump had called her about helping to further the scheme; Eastman also participated in the call.[186][187]\n\nTrump calls the Georgia Secretary of State\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, whose phone call with Trump was cited in the former president\'s second impeachment, testified that his office pursued hundreds of allegations of voter fraud but found no widespread fraud that would have changed the election result. In the end, he found only 74 votes from people who had been ineligible to vote because of felony convictions and only 4 votes in the names of deceased people. There were no votes from underage or unregistered voters.[188] (Biden had won the Georgia election by 11,779 votes.) Gabriel Sterling, Raffensperger\'s deputy, also testified.[14]\n\nDuring the Raffensperger testimony, the committee played audio excerpts of the phone call he had with Trump on January 2, 2021, and another call with Frances Watson, the chief investigative officer for Raffensperger\'s office. Trump told Watson, ""when the right answer comes out you\'ll be praised."" Trump is heard to tell Raffensperger he had won Georgia by at least 400,000 votes, though he actually lost by 11,779 votes. He told Raffensperger, ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."" Trump repeated a debunked allegation that a video showed a suitcase containing a minimum of ""18,000 ballots, all for Biden"" brought to a ballot counting facility late at night for counting. Trump pleaded with Raffensperger to find ""the real truth"" and suggested Raffensperger could be criminally liable if he did not accede to the president\'s wishes:\n\nWhy wouldn\'t you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? So look, can you get together tomorrow? And Brad, we just want the truth. It\'s simple. And—and everyone\'s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It\'s Ok. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the truth—the real truth is I won by 400,000 votes, at least. So—so what are we going to do here? Because I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break...I think you\'re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned, the ballots are—are corrupt and they\'re brand new and they don\'t have seals and there\'s a whole thing with the ballots, but the ballots are corrupt and you\'re going to find that they are—which is totally illegal. It\'s—it\'s more illegal for you than it is for them. Because you know what they did and you\'re not reporting it. That\'s a—you know, that\'s a criminal—that\'s a criminal offense. And you know, you can\'t let that happen. That\'s—that\'s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that\'s a big risk.[189]\n\nSurrogates pressured the Arizona House leadership\n\n[edit]\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified. Bowers said that Trump had personally pressured him to overturn the state\'s election results, as had Rudy Giuliani, Ginni Thomas,[190] and John Eastman. Bowers said that Eastman told him: ""Just do it and let the courts sort it out."" Bowers characterized Trump\'s scheme as ""cheating"", since there was ""no evidence being presented of any strength"" of the claims. He said that participating in Trump\'s lie would have been ""foreign to my very being."" He also testified that Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs called him on the morning of January 6, asking him to overturn the Arizona results. Shortly before the committee hearing, Trump released a statement saying that Bowers had privately agreed with him in November 2020 that the Arizona election was rigged and stolen, but Bowers specifically denied Trump\'s allegation during the hearing while under oath.[191] Bowers testified Giuliani told him, ""We\'ve got lots of theories. We just don\'t have the evidence.""[186]\n\nSean Riley ""alternate electors"" plan for Wisconsin and Michigan\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Trump fake electors plot\n\nThe committee revealed a text message sent by Senator Ron Johnson\'s chief of staff Sean Riley minutes before the vote certification began on January 6. In the message, Riley informed Pence\'s aide Chris Hodgson that the senator wanted to personally hand deliver information to the vice president about ""alternate slates of electors for MI and WI"" to which Hodgson replied, ""do not give that to him.""[192]\n\nImpact of false fraud allegations on election workers\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorgia election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea\' ArShaye Moss testified about their experiences. After the election, Trump and Giuliani amplified a video that was taken out of context, and used the footage to make baseless claims that Freeman and Moss had committed election fraud. The women and their family members were subjected to anti-Black racist smears and death threats and were warned by the FBI that they would not be safe in their home. During her testimony, Freeman said ""There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you?""[193][194] Ms. Moss said that the false accusations made against her had impacted her well-being ""in a major way—in every way—all because of lies.""[195]\n\nReactions to fourth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFox News anchor Martha MacCallum acknowledged on June 21 after the fourth hearing: ""The lack of [election fraud] evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here, where these [Republican] people are saying, \'Look, I supported you, please give me something to work with,\' and it simply doesn\'t materialize.""[196] Fox News host Brian Kilmeade similarly said on June 26 that Trump\'s allies ""couldn\'t prove"" any cheating had occurred.[197]\n\nBy the fourth hearing, committee members saw an increase in threats against them and were likely to be assigned security details. Kinzinger\'s wife received a handwritten letter that threatened to execute her, her husband and their five-month-old baby.[198]\n\nA month later, on July 20, the Arizona Republican Party censured Rusty Bowers for reasons ""including co-sponsoring Democrat-led bills"" and ""refusing to work with"" Arizona Republicans. They did not directly mention his public testimony at the committee\'s fourth hearing.[199] The state party had censured other leaders the previous year for criticizing Trump.[200]\n\nFifth hearing – June 23, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee Member, Representative (R-IL 16th district)\n\nSteven Engel – former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel\n\nJeffrey A.

Miller – former Acting Secretary Of Defense\n\nSynopsis of fifth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fifth televised public hearing focused on Trump\'s pressure campaign to influence top Justice Department officials, demanding they investigate election fraud conspiracy theories and rubber stamp his narrative that the election was stolen, despite any factual evidence to support this claim. The hearing additionally detailed Trump\'s request to seize voting machines in late December 2020; plans to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general were also revealed. Witnesses included Jeffrey Rosen, former acting attorney general; Richard Donoghue, former acting deputy attorney general; and Steven Engel, former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\n""Just say it was corrupt""\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Trump\'s request, acting defense secretary Christopher Miller contacted an attaché in Rome about the debunked QAnon theory which alleged an Italian defense contractor uploaded malware to a satellite in order to hack the election results and remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. The conspiracy theory was relayed by Congressman Scott Perry to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who then asked Rosen and Donoghue to investigate on behalf of the Department of Justice.[201] They flatly rejected the request as ""patently absurd.""[202] The conspiracy theory was also pushed by former CIA employee Bradley Johnson,[201] who was among those who gave video testimony.[203]\n\nRosen and Donoghue continued to strongly resist Trump\'s efforts to have the Justice Department announce election fraud had been found, just days after outgoing attorney general Bill Barr had resigned and announced that there was no significant evidence found which could have influenced the election.[204] Donoghue testified that during a phone call with then president Trump on December 27, he was told to ""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.""[205][206]\n\nOn December 31, Trump rushed back to Washington, D.C., from his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate in order to hold an emergency meeting at the White House, in which Justice Department officials were called upon to attend. At one point, Trump told them that voting machines had been hacked and the election stolen. Trump then asked ""why don\'t you guys seize these machines?"" Richard Donoghue explained that experts at DHS had already investigated and that there was ""nothing wrong with the voting machines ... and no factual basis to seize machines.""[207] Trump then yelled: ""Get Ken Cuccinelli on the phone"" and proceeded to insist that it was his job, as the Homeland Security deputy secretary, to seize voting machines. He told Cuccinelli ""you\'re not doing your job.""[208] During the public hearing, Jeffrey Rosen testified that the Department of Justice has no legal authority to seize voting machines and that he never informed Trump that the Department of Homeland Security could seize voting machines either.[209]\n\nAborted attempt to install Jeffrey Clark as Attorney General\n\n[edit]\n\nClark was shown to have provided a ""proof of concept"" letter, that was composed by John Eastman and Justice Department lawyer Ken Klukowsi, intending that the letter be delivered to Georgia officials. The letter falsely asserted that the Justice Department found election irregularities in that state and others, in an effort to persuade the state legislature to rescind Biden\'s certified victory in Georgia. In response to this proposed letter, a ""contentious"" meeting was held between Clark, Attorney General Rosen, and Deputy Attorney General Donoghue, in which Donoghue told Clark: ""What you are doing is nothing less than the United States Justice Department meddling in the outcome of a presidential election.""[210] When Rosen refused to send the letter, Clark then sought to take over the Department of Justice so that he could send the letter himself.[211]\n\nAccording to The New York Times it was Rep. Scott Perry who had first introduced Trump and Clark, because of Clark\'s ""openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud"" and willingness to do the president\'s bidding.[212] The committee presented text messages from December 26, 2020, between Rep. Perry and Mark Meadows, that revealed the congressman\'s role in the attempted scheme that unfolded days later to oust Rosen and install Clark as the top DOJ official.[213]\n\nWhite House call logs from the afternoon of January 3 showed that officials within the Oval Office were already referring to Clark as the ""Acting Attorney General"" although not having been officially appointed to the position. Later that day, in a meeting at the White House with top Department of Justice officials, Trump openly considered a move to replace Rosen with Clark, saying ""What do I have to lose?"" to which Deputy Attorney General Donoghue replied ""Mr. President, we\'d resign immediately. I\'m not working one minute for this guy, who I just declared was completely incompetent ... I\'m telling you what\'s going to happen. You\'re gonna lose your entire department leadership. Every single one of us will walk out. Your entire department of leadership will walk out within hours.""[214]\n\nUltimately, the effort to appoint Clark, send the letter to Georgia officials, and attempt to decertify election results was averted when a majority of the DOJ Assistant Attorneys General threatened to resign en masse if the scheme went forward.[215][216] During Clark\'s video taped deposition with the committee, he refused to answer most questions, and pleaded the Fifth more than 100 times during his 100-minutes-long interview with investigators.[217]\n\nRequest for preemptive pardons\n\n[edit]\n\nExtracts of a January 11 email sent by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks were shared. The congressman, who had championed efforts in the House to overturn the election in Trump\'s favor, contacted former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with pardon requests for himself, Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert and ""every Congressman and Senator"" who recently voted to reject official electoral college submissions for Arizona and Pennsylvania.[218][215] White House aides mentioned that Andy Biggs of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania had all requested preemptive pardons.[219][213] Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Meadows, previously told the committee that Rep. Jim Jordan also talked generally about pardons for members of Congress.[220]\n\nSixth hearing – June 28, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nCassidy Hutchinson – principal aide to President Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nMax Miller – Deputy Campaign Manager for presidential operations Trump 2020\n\nNick Luna – White House special assistant to the President\n\nKayleigh McEnany – Former White House Press Secretary\n\nMichael Flynn – Former National Security Advisor\n\nMatthew Pottinger – United States Deputy National Security Advisor from September 22, 2019, until January 7, 2021\n\nSynopsis of sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sixth televised hearing was dedicated entirely to the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.[221][222][223] Meadows had provided a large amount of documentation to the committee but then stopped cooperating,[224][225] sued the committee,[226] and was held in criminal contempt of Congress in December 2021.[227]\n\nDue to heightened security concerns surrounding Hutchinson\'s testimony, the committee announced this hearing only one day in advance.[228][229] Ms. Hutchinson obtained her own security prior to her public appearance,[230] and the committee enhanced its security for the sixth hearing at which she testified.[231]\n\nPrelude to January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson said that Rudy Giuliani told her on January 2 that Trump and his allies planned to go to the Capitol on January 6. When she reported this to her boss, Meadows, he ""didn\'t look up from his phone and said something to the effect of ... \'things might get real, real bad\'."" The committee also showed prior videotaped testimony in which Hutchinson said the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were mentioned in the context of planning the January 6 rally, especially in Giuliani\'s presence.[232] She said that White House counsel Pat Cipollone tried to prevent anyone from the White House from marching to the Capitol and told her personally: ""Please make sure we don\'t go up to the Capitol, Cass. ... We are going to get charged with every crime imaginable.""[233]\n\nHutchinson said she persuaded Meadows not to go to Giuliani and Eastman\'s ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel on the evening of January 5, where former National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was also present. Meadows, she said, told her he would instead phone into the meeting.[234]\n\nFlynn was subpoenaed by the committee. During his interview, Rep. Cheney asked: ""General Flynn, do you believe in the peaceful transition of power in the United States of America?"" He pled the Fifth. This video clip was shown at the hearing.[235][236]\n\nHutchinson testified that on the day before the Capitol attack, Trump directed Meadows to contact Flynn and Roger Stone, who both had extensive ties to extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, leaders of which would later be indicted for seditious conspiracy for their alleged roles in the attack.[237]\n\nHutchinson account of January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nTrump had insisted on specific language for his speech at the January 6 rally. Hutchinson recalled legal advice given by Eric Herschmann, who said it would be ""foolish"" to include some of the phrases, such as ""We\'re going to March to the Capitol"" and ""Fight for Trump ... Fight for the movement."" Herschmann also warned against making negative references to Mike Pence.[238][239]\n\nSome people brought weapons, including AR-15s, to Trump\'s speech, according to police radio transmissions.[240] Trump knew the crowd was armed yet wanted security checks loosened; he specifically wanted the magnetometers removed.[241][242][243] Hutchinson, who was present at the rally, testified that she heard Trump say ""something to the effect of \'I don\'t F-ing care that they have weapons. They\'re not here to hurt me.\'"" Meadows and deputy chief of staff for operations Tony Ornato were also aware of the weapons, according to Hutchinson.[232] As the mob became more vocal, calling for Pence to be hanged, Hutchinson overheard a conversation between Cipollone and Meadows, in which Cipollone argued that they needed to act urgently to prevent violence. Meadows, however, reminded Cipollone of Trump\'s current feelings that Pence ""deserves it"" and that Trump ""doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.""[232]\n\nShe testified that Trump wanted to appear in-person at the Capitol following his speech to supporters. Secret Service agent Robert Engel said it would not be safe to go to the Capitol and insisted on taking him to the White House instead. Hutchinson was told later that day by Tony Ornato that Trump became very angry and insisted he wanted to go to the Capitol.[242] Ornato said Trump grabbed for the steering wheel of the presidential SUV[244] with one hand and lunged at Engel with his other hand, according to Hutchinson.[245][232] She testified that Engel was sitting in a chair, looking ""somewhat discombobulated and a little lost"" while Ornato related the account of these events, and that Engel never contradicted the story.[246][247]\n\nCNN reported three days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump\'s driver. Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump ""tried to lunge over the seat—for what reason, nobody had any idea,"" but no one asserted Trump assaulted Engel.[248] Politico reported the same day that Engel told the committee during an early 2022 deposition that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months.[249]\n\nWhile the committee questioned Hutchinson, they showed brief clips of the videotaped testimony of others. National Security Council records, which identified Trump by his codename ""Mogul,"" also backed Hutchinson\'s claim that security was loosened, and that orders were made to NSC and Secret Service for ""clearing a route"".[250]\n\nImmediate January 6 aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson testified that during the riot she wrote down from Meadows\' dictation a proposed statement the president might release, instructing the insurgents to leave the Capitol. She said White House attorney Eric Herschmann ""chimed in"" with his input. The note was displayed during the hearing, and Hutchinson confirming it was in her handwriting. After the hearing, Herschmann said through a spokesperson that he had written the note.[251]\n\nHutchinson testified that both Meadows and Giuliani sought presidential pardons.[252]\n\nRep. Cheney addresses possible tampering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn closing remarks, Cheney expressed concern that some witnesses may have been given messages intended to influence their testimony. She said a witness, whom she did not name, told the committee they had received multiple such messages prior to giving testimony to the committee: ""What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know that I\'m on the team, I\'m doing the right thing, I\'m protecting who I need to protect, you know, I\'ll continue to stay in good graces in Trump world.""[253] She quoted another unnamed witness being told that ""he is thinking about you"", that ""he knows you\'re loyal"" and ""will do the right thing.""[253] Two days after the hearing, Politico reported that Hutchinson was the recipient of the quoted communications, prior to her March 7 deposition, and that the ""he is thinking about you"" message came from an intermediary for Mark Meadows.[254] Cheney stated that the committee was taking allegations of witness tampering seriously and that they would consider the ""next steps"" necessary to address the issue.[255][256]\n\nOn December 20, 2022, it was reported that Trump administration ethics attorney Stefan Passantino had advised Hutchinson, who was then his client, to testify that she didn\'t remember details. Trump’s Save America PAC was paying for Passantino\'s services, which Hutchinson was not aware of. Hutchinson disagreed with Passantino\'s advice and switched lawyers before she testified.[257][258]\n\nReactions to sixth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nHutchinson’s testimony was subject to significant national attention. According to Time, ""[it] garnered a reaction that no other had received to date. As she exited the hearing room when the committee broke for a short recess, a crowd in the back applauded her.""[259] Fox News host Bret Baier said her ""testimony was very compelling from beginning to end""; conservative commentator George Conway said ""This is the most astonishing testimony I have ever seen or heard or read. You could litigate or investigate for a thousand years and never see anything as mind-blowing as this.""[260] The Lawfare blog editorialized, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Testimony Changed Our Minds about Indicting Donald Trump"".[261] The testimony was widely characterized by legal analysts and the press as highly significant, particularly in the context of possible indictments of Trump and his associates in the Justice Department\'s criminal investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Former Trump attorney general Bill Barr remarked, ""the department is clearly looking into all this, and this hearing definitely gave investigators a lot to chew on.""[262][263]\n\nAfter Hutchinson\'s testimony, CNN reported that an unnamed ""Secret Service official familiar with the matter"" said Ornato denied telling Hutchinson about a physical altercation. CNN also reported that the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs would make involved agents available to the committee for sworn testimony, at which time they would be prepared to say the incident did not occur.[264] According to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, ""Some of the officers said that they would be coming and talking under oath ... [But] they have not come in"" and instead, Ornato, Engel, and the unnamed driver of the president\'s armored vehicle have all retained legal counsel.[265] (Months later, the committee interviewed the driver.)[266]\n\nOrnato led Trump\'s Secret Service detail until the president named him White House deputy chief of staff for operations in December 2019; Ornato took an unprecedented leave of absence from his civil service Secret Service position to accept the political appointment.[267][268] Politico reported two days after Hutchinson\'s testimony that members of the committee were skeptical of Ornato\'s credibility due to assertions made in his January and March depositions.[269] Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig, author of the 2021 book Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service, characterized Engel and Ornato as ""very, very close to President Trump."" During an MSNBC interview she stated: ""some people accused them of at times being enablers and \'yes men\' of the president—particularly Tony Ornato—and very much people who wanted to ... see him pleased."" Leonnig said there was a large contingent of Trump\'s Secret Service detail that wanted Biden to fail and some ""took to their personal media accounts to cheer on the insurrection and the individuals riding up to the Capitol as patriots.""[270] Two months after Hutchinson\'s testimony, Ornato, who was then serving as assistant director of the Secret Service, announced his retirement.[271] Ornato then testified to the committee that he didn\'t remember telling Hutchinson about any physical altercation between Trump and the limo driver. The committee wrote in its final report that it was ""difficult to fully reconcile the accounts"" from various witnesses regarding a physical altercation, though witnesses agreed that Trump had been angry.[272]\n\nTrump responded by attacking Hutchinson repeatedly on the Truth Social platform which he owns. He disputed the veracity of many of her statements and called her a ""liar"" and ""total phony.""[260] With regard to Trump\'s denials about Hutchinson\'s testimony, Fox News anchor Bret Baier noted on June 28: ""Cassidy Hutchinson is under oath on Capitol Hill. The President is on Truth Social ... [Her] testimony in and of itself is really, really powerful.""[273]\n\nOn the same day as Hutchinson\'s testimony, anonymous conspiracy theorist ""Q"" posted to 8kun,[274] claiming Hutchinson was involved in a plot to disparage Trump.[275][276] QAnon influencer Jordan Sather called Hutchinson a ""plant"", writing on his Telegram channel: ""Is Cassidy being used as a Trojan Horse to destroy the credibility of these hearings with her obviously fake testimony?""[277]\n\nIn response to the sixth hearing, conservative author David French wrote an article for The Dispatch titled ""The Case for Prosecuting Donald Trump Just Got Much Stronger."" According to The Guardian, ""In French\'s view, Trump demonstrably summoned the mob, knew it was armed and dangerous, told it to \'fight like hell\' and tried to march with it."" French wrote that ""Hutchinson\'s sworn testimony closes a gap in the criminal case ... Trump is closer to a credible prosecution than ever before.""[278][279]\n\nOn the day after Hutchinson\'s testimony, the Washington Examiner, a conservative publication widely read by Trump supporters, published an editorial entitled ""Trump proven unfit for power again."" The paper\'s board wrote, in part, ""Cassidy Hutchinson\'s Tuesday testimony ought to ring the death knell for former President Donald Trump\'s political career ... Trump is a disgrace. Republicans have far better options to lead the party in 2024. No one should think otherwise, much less support him, ever again.""[280][281]\n\nSeventh hearing – July 12, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nJamie Raskin – Committee Member, Representative (D-MD 8th district)\n\nStephanie Murphy – Committee Member, Representative (D-FL 7th district)\n\nJason Van Tatenhove – Former national media director for the Oath Keepers until leaving the group in 2017\n\nStephen Ayres – Participant in the January 6 United States Capitol attack who pleaded guilty to disorderly and disruptive conduct\n\nSynopsis of seventh hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe seventh televised hearing presented links between then-President Donald Trump and the extreme domestic militias that helped coordinate the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.[3][20] The committee and panel of witnesses discussed ""the rise of the right-wing domestic violent extremist groups that attacked the Capitol and how Mr. Trump amassed and inspired the mob.""[3] In addition, the panel described ""known links and conversations between political actors close to Mr. Trump and extremists.""[3] Committee member Jamie Raskin stated, ""Donald Trump solicited the mob; he summoned the mob to Washington ... All of this was targeted on the joint session of Congress.""[3] It focused on testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, plotting by far-right extremist groups and discussions about using the military to seize voting machines.""[282] Jason Van Tatenhove, who served as media director of Oath Keepers, testified as well.[283][284] The focus of the hearing was connections, including Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, between the Trump administration and militia groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.[285]\n\nIn new disclosed videotaped testimony, Pat Cipollone described, among other things, an ""unhinged"" White House meeting which took place on December 18, 2020, between himself, Trump, Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn and Patrick M. Byrne, who he named as members of an outside group pushing election conspiracy theories, and that they exhibited a ""general disregard for backing what you actually say with facts.""[286] Cipollone testified that during the meeting, a draft executive order which would\'ve directed the U.S. military to seize voting machines was discussed.[287] A former Twitter employee who testified on anonymity also testified that Twitter, which Trump used to help organize the rally, “relished in the knowledge that they were also the favorite and most used service of the former president and enjoyed having that sort of power within the social media ecosystem” and that he was concerned about Trump\'s December 19, 2020, tweet which encouraged people to come to the ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.""[288] This tweet would lead to further solicitation of the January 6 rally on extremist Internet sources and right wing media.[289] One notable example came from Kelly Meggs, the head of the Florida Oath Keepers, who posted a message on Facebook pledging that his group would ""work together"" with the Three Percenters and Proud Boys, two other right-wing extremist groups, just hours after the tweet was posted.[289] Trump was also revealed to have posted the tweet not long after a meeting with Powell, Flynn and Rudy Giuliani had concluded.[288]\n\nIn videotaped testimony, former White House officials testified about an extremist rally which was held outside the White House at Freedom Plaza the night before the U.S. Capitol attack, which Sarah Matthews described as bringing Trump a good mood.[290] In their videotaped testimonies, former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia and Ivanka Trump stated that they called on Trump to concede the election after the Electoral College votes were cast in respective states on December 14, 2020, but were ignored.[291][292] Documented draft speeches were also revealed showing that Trump had in fact edited his January 6, 2021, Ellipse speech as well, to include negative words towards Vice President Mike Pence.[290] Important information about Roger Stone\'s direct links to Proud Boys, which included encrypted chats with the Proud Boys Florida leader and video evidence showing him appear with members and reciting the Proud Boys\' ""Fraternity Creed"", would be revealed as well.[293] Kellye SoRelle, a lawyer who assists the Oath Keepers and a volunteer attorney for the Trump campaign, named Stone, Info War\'s Alex Jones, and pro-Trump organizer Ali Alexander as the people who organized the January 2021 Stop the Steal rallies.[293] Footage of Stone, Jones, Alexander and Michael Flynn speaking at the January 5, 2021, Freedom Plaza rally were shown as well.[294]\n\nJason Van Tatenhove, who was first hired by the Oath Keepers in 2014, gave live testimony about the group\'s radicalization and how Stewart Rhodes, the group\'s founder, used conspiracy theories to increase membership and funding, stating that Oath Keepers drifted ""further and further right—into the alt-right world, into White nationalists and even straight-up racists and it came to a point where I could no longer continue to work for them"".[295] He said he finally decided to leave the group was when he heard members talking about how the Holocaust was not real.[295]\n\nA text message which rally organizer Kylie Kremer sent to election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell on January 4, 2021, and which was made public during the hearing, revealed that Trump would ""call for [the march] unexpectedly"" but they didn\'t want word to get out in advance in order to avoid a countermarch.[289] During his live testimony, Ohio resident Stephen Ayres, who participated in the riot despite not being affiliated with any extremist organization, noted how Trump ""got everybody riled up, told everybody to head on down"" and that ""We basically were just following what he said.""[289] Ayres also stated that he did not plan to go to the U.S. Capitol until Trump encouraged the Ellipse crowd to do so.[289]\n\nIn her closing statement, Liz Cheney stated that Donald Trump attempted to contact an unidentified witness who has yet to appear in the hearings, hinting at the possibility of witness tampering: ""That person declined to answer or respond to President Trump\'s call, and instead alerted their lawyer to the call. Their lawyer alerted us. And this committee has supplied that information to the Department of Justice.""[296][297]\n\nEighth hearing – July 21, 2022 – Primetime\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses In pre-recorded testimony In audio visual exhibits\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)[a]\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nAdam Kinzinger – Committee member, (R-Ill 16th district)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nSarah Matthews – Former Deputy Press Secretary in the President Trump Administration\n\nMatthew Pottinger – Former National Security Aide in the President Trump Administration\n\nMarc Short -

Mark Robinson, a former MPD police officer who was assigned to the presidential motorcade\'s lead TS vehicle on January 6, 2021.[304] Robinson stated that he was told firsthand that Trump got into a ""heated discussion"" about wanting to go to the U.S. Capitol.[304]\n\nSarah Matthews, deputy press secretary in the Trump White House, and Matthew Pottinger,[305] who served on the National Security Council, testified in person. Both had resigned shortly after the attack on the Capitol.[306] Evidence and details were presented of Trump\'s refusal to call off the attack, in spite of numerous pleas from officials, for hours.[307] Never-before-seen footage of Trump\'s January 7, 2021, speech criticizing the January 6 attack was also released which revealed Trump\'s hesitance to make the speech as it was written.[308] Former White House advisor, as well as Trump son-in-law, Jared Kushner stated in videotaped testimony that House of Representatives leader Kevin McCarthy pleaded for White House intervention during a January 6 phone call and that he thought McCarthy was ""scared.""[309] A newly disclosed January 6 text message between Donald Trump Jr. and Mark Meadows revealed that Trump Jr. wanted his father to ""condemn this shit"" and ""go to the mattresses,"" a film reference which Trump Jr. claimed during video testimony he thought meant ""go all in.""[310] Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney stated, ""Every American must consider this ... Can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of Jan. 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?"". Committee Chair Thompson said, ""If there is no accountability for Jan. 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy ... There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.""[22]\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Cheney said, ""In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward ... Doors have opened. New subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break ... We have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people and more to gather ... So our committee will spend August pursuing emerging information on multiple fronts before convening further hearings this September.""[311]\n\nNinth hearing – October 13, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nZoe Lofgren – Committee member, Representative (D-CA 19th district)\n\nAdam Kinzinger (R-IL 16th)\n\nElaine Luria – Committee member (D-Va 2nd district)\n\nAdam Schiff (D-CA 28th)\n\nStephanie Murphy (D-FL 7th)\n\nJared Kushner - former White House advisor, voice only\n\nBill Stepien - former Trump campaign manager, in video\n\nGreg Jacob - former counsel to Vice President Pence\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, in video - pled 5th\n\nJason Miller - former senior campaign staffer, in video\n\nChris Stirewalt - a former Fox News political editor, video of previous January 6th heating.\n\nMark Milley - General, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voice only.\n\nAlyssa Farah - former White House communications director, in video\n\nCassidy Hutchinson - former aide to Mark Meadows, in video\n\nKeith Kellogg - former national security advisor to Vice President Pence, in video.\n\nJohn McEntee - former director, White House Presidential Personnel, in video.\n\nDouglas Macgregor - former advisor to the Secretary of Defense, in video.\n\nAlex Cannon- former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMatt Morgan - former Trump Campaign lawyer, in video.\n\nMike Pompeo - former Secretary of State, in video.\n\nIvanka Trump - voice only.\n\nWilliam Barr - former Attorney General, in video.\n\nJudd Deere - former White House Deputy Press Secretary, in video\n\nEugene Scalia - former Secretary of Labor, in video\n\nRichard Donoghue – Former Acting Deputy Attorney General\n\nDonald Trump - in video, in audio, and written communications\n\nGreg Jacob - in written memo for Marc Short\n\nTom Fitton - written communications in an email to Molly Michael and Dan Scavino\n\nSteve Bannon - Trump outside advisor, voice and video interviews with media.\n\nRoger Stone - Trump outside advisor, video footage, and written communications\n\nAmy Berman Jackson - Judge, January 6th defendant sentencing hearing\n\nKelly and Connie Meggs - in written documents\n\nMike Pence - former Vice President, in video speech at Federalist Society 4th February 2022\n\nSynopsis of ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth televised hearing was held October 13, 2022, at 1 pm Eastern time. It was originally scheduled for September 28[312][313] but postponed due to the devastation of Hurricane Ian.[314][315] The hearing focused on evidence and testimony regarding Trump\'s involvement in events surrounding the attack of the Capitol, as well as information on the controversial website ""thedonald.win"", newly released videos of Nancy Pelosi, her Congress members, and lawmakers at their secure location during the attack, newly released videos on the rioters\' reactions to Trump\'s ""go home"" message, and newly released texts from Secret Service agents demonstrating the awareness and warning signals about potential threats to both Pence and Congress in advance of January 6.[27][28][316] The committee was also expecting to vote on its next investigation steps, and unanimously voted to subpoena Trump to make him testify.[27][28][317]\n\nAmong those shown in video testimony footage were former Trump Administration officials Mick Mulvaney and Elaine Chao.[316] Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Washington, also gave video testimony about what she claimed Kevin McCarthy told her about his phone conversation with Trump, which Mulvaney corroborated.[316] Video testimony was also shown of former Twitter employee Anika Navaroli, who was revealed to have previously testified anonymously.[316] Although the committee had already interviewed Ginni Thomas, it didn\'t feature any of her testimony in this public hearing.[318] Video of Roger Stone was also presented, as well as evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results.[25][26] Stone was also shown endorsing ""the right to violence.""[319]\n\nPrior to the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ninth hearing—which the committee had planned to hold since July[320]—included further details regarding ""the potential unauthorized deletion"" of text messages, particularly those from January 5 and 6, 2021, by the United States Secret Service, which has been headed by Director James M. Murray, a Trump appointee.[321][322][323][324] Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, a Trump appointee, alerted Congress on July 13, 2022, that Secret Service communication records had been deleted, following a months-long delay in reporting the matter.[325][326] According to The Washington Post, the whistleblowers who revealed this delay said they ""shared a concern that Cuffari\'s office not alerting congressional investigators to the missing records reduced the chances of recovering critical pieces of evidence related to the Jan. 6 attack.""[322][327]\n\nOn August 1, 2022, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson reiterated calls for Cuffari to step down due to a ""lack of transparency"" that could be ""jeopardizing the integrity"" of crucial investigations regarding the missing Secret Service text messages.[328] That same day, an official inside the DHS inspector general\'s office told Politico that Cuffari and his staff are ""uniquely unqualified to lead an Inspector General\'s office, and ... The crucial oversight mission of the DHS OIG has been compromised.""[329] Congress also obtained a July 2021 e-mail, from deputy inspector general Thomas Kait, who told senior DHS officials there was no longer a need for any Secret Service phone records or text messages. Efforts to collect communications related to Jan. 6 were therefore shutdown by Kait just six weeks after the internal DHS investigation began. The Guardian wrote that ""Taken together, the new revelations appear to show that the chief watchdog for the Secret Service and the DHS took deliberate steps to stop the retrieval of texts it knew were missing, and then sought to hide the fact that it had decided not to pursue that evidence.""[330]\n\nText messages from January 6, 2021, were deleted from the phones of Trump-appointed officials at the Pentagon after the watchdog group American Oversight filed FOIA requests to obtain the messages. This was not addressed in the July hearings because it was first reported on August 2.[331][332]\n\nOn August 29, 2022, Representative Kinzinger had stated in a Meet the Press interview that the next public hearings would focus on donations Trump solicited for the ""Stop The Steal"" movement but did not use for that purpose, as well as on the possible Secret Service coverup.[333]\n\nAftermath of the ninth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Politico reported that they had obtained some of John Eastman\'s e-mail correspondences. The series of messages were from December 31, 2020, and had been turned over to congressional investigators, but had not yet been made public. In one exchange, Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro wrote ""We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue some sort of stay or other circuit justice opinion saying Georgia is in legitimate doubt"", and posited that Justice Thomas would be their ""only chance to get a favorable judicial opinion by Jan. 6, which might hold up the Georgia count in Congress"". Attorney John Eastman replied ""I think I agree with this"", saying that they needed to ""kick the Georgia legislature into gear"" in order to favor Trump and overturn election results. The plan was to file a lawsuit and have a pending case with the Supreme Court, thus delaying the Senate\'s count of Biden\'s electors. Chesebro wrote that Justice Thomas would be the key figure necessary, if the plan were to succeed, because he would be the justice assigned to dealing with any emergency legal matters sent to the southeastern region\'s Eleventh Circuit court.[334][335]\n\nTrump subpoena\n\n[edit]\n\nThe January 6 Committee\'s subpoena for testimony and related documents was formally issued to Trump on October 21, 2022.[336] Under the subpoena, the committee demanded that Trump hand over documents related to communications with Roger Stone, John Eastman, and others by November 4, and requested testimony by November 14. The committee also specified that they wanted ""information sufficient to identify every telephone or other communications device"" used by Trump between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021.[337][338]\n\nOn November 11, 2022, Trump sued the House select committee and challenged the subpoena, seeking to block testimony and submission of documents. Chairman Bennie Thompson has called the legal effort a ""delay tactic"".[339][340][341]\n\nThe committee\'s official legal capacity to conduct their investigation expired on December 31, 2022. Just days before the end of December, the committee formally withdrew Trump\'s subpoena. Chairman Thompson said ""... the select committee has concluded its hearings, released its final report and ... In light of the imminent end of our investigation, the select committee can no longer pursue the specific information covered by the subpoena"".[342]\n\nTenth hearing – December 19, 2022\n\n[edit]\n\nParticipants\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect Committee members Witnesses On pre-recorded testimony On audio-visual exhibit\n\nBennie Thompson – Chairman, Representative (D-MS 2nd district)\n\nLiz Cheney – Vice Chair, Representative (R-WY)\n\nSynopsis of tenth hearing\n\n[edit]\n\nFull-length video of the tenth and final public hearing of the Select Committee.

They recommended that Trump be charged with four crimes:[344] 18 U.S.C § 1512(c),[345] 18 U.S.C § 371,[346] 18 U.S.C § 1001,[347] and 18 U.S.C § 2383.[348] (These are: Obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and ""incite,"" ""assist"" or ""aid or comfort"" an insurrection.)[349][350] Raskin also stated that the subcommittee\'s work had been limited by the lack of cooperation, and hopes the DOJ can use the subcommittee\'s work for their own investigation.\n\nThe committee also referred John Eastman.[351]\n\nNewer, previously un-televised video testimony from Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway was shown as well.[352] In her testimony, Hicks, who was Trump\'s White House communications director, claimed that Trump at one point told her ""something along the lines of \'nobody will care about my legacy if I lose ... the only thing that matters is winning.\'""[353] Conway, in her testimony, claimed that she briefly spoke with Trump the day after the Capitol attack and that he said his supporters were upset.[354]\n\nThe committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (California), Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Scott Perry (Pennsylvania), and Andy Biggs (Arizona) refusing to answer subpoenas.[31]\n\nImmediately after the hearing, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its findings.[33][34][35] It said it was ready to release its final report. The vote of the committee was unanimous.[349][350]\n\nMedia coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, ""The eight hearings held by the House committee investigating the ... attack on the U.S. Capitol have been riveting to watch—and even more remarkably, they have captured the daily news cycle again and again, not only finding substantial TV and streaming audiences as they aired but also consistently landing at the top of broadcast and cable news reports and of newspaper front pages."" The Post referenced several factors for the popularity of the hearings, stating that ""Each hearing has produced at least one legitimate nugget of actual news, and sometimes more than one."" They cited the importance of the brisk pace of the hearings which ""move[d] expeditiously from brief opening statements to video or live testimony"" and without extemporaneous speeches or tedious delays. Liz Cheney was called ""a compelling central character"" with ""steely resolve and understated intensity"" who ""is hard to look away from."" The Post also gave some importance to timing, saying that ""other major news stories of recent months ... have not occurred on the same dates as the hearings themselves.""[355]\n\nAccording to CNN, ""the committee has certainly succeeded in keeping the attention of America\'s political junkies. Trump devotees are the exception to that rule, but even they have dropped the \'nobody\'s watching the hearings\' talking point that was trotted out in June.

Cobb on Friday asked a federal prosecutor to explain the Justice Department\'s handling of a misdemeanor case against a Jan. 6 defendant who admitted that he ""scuffled"" with officers inside the Capitol, including an officer who later died by suicide.\n\nDavid Walls-Kaufman, a Washington, D.C., resident, was supposed to be sentenced on Friday, but Cobb delayed imposing the sentence after receiving information from the officer\'s family. The family is pursuing a civil suit that accuses Walls-Kaufman of assault and playing a role in the death of Jeffrey Smith, a Metropolitan Police Department officer who died by suicide following the Jan. 6 attack. Cobb, on Friday, asked the department for their view of the evidence of the alleged assault, noting he was only charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nWalls-Kaufman, who lived just blocks away from the U.S. Capitol and told investigators he previously worked for a congressional committee, was arrested in June 2022 and charged with four counts. His arrest came after he was identified by the ""Sedition Hunters,"" online sleuths who have poured over evidence of the Jan. 6 attack, and after Walls-Kaufman was sued by Smith\'s widow.\n\nOfficer Smith\'s body-worn camera footage, which was released because of the civil suit, appeared to confirm that Walls-Kaufman grabbed Smith\'s baton during a scuffle on Jan. 6, and that Smith appeared shaken up afterward. The footage also showed that, later in the night, Smith was separately struck by a flying metal object that an unknown person threw at the police line as police attempted to clear the western front of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSmith’s widow said that the late officer was a different person when he returned from duty after Jan. 6. He sought medical attention that night, but the police and fire clinic was overwhelmed, dealing with dozens of officers who suffered injuries that day. He died by suicide the day he returned to duty. Last March, the D.C. Police and Firefighters’ Retirement and Relief Board found that the injuries that Smith sustained on Jan. 6 were “the sole and direct cause,” declaring his death to be in the line of duty.\n\nIn January, Walls-Kaufman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of ""parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building,"" admitting in his agreed-upon statement of offense that he entered the Capitol through the rotunda doors on the east side of the building ""shortly after they were first breached"" and made his way into the office of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. There, prosecutors say video shows him disabling the lock on the top of a double door, allowing more rioters to flow in-and-out of the room where Pelosi took conference calls. Walls-Kaufman, prosecutors say, snapped a photo of a laptop that Pelosi used for her Zoom calls shortly before another rioter grabbed it.\n\nWalls-Kaufman soon headed over to the House chamber, where Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot as she jumped through a broken window leading into the Speaker\'s Lobby off the floor of the House, as lawmakers evacuated. Walls-Kaufman admitted that he ""scuffled with officers"" and was forced out of the Capitol at around 2:57 p.m., about a half-hour after he entered the building.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors sought 60 days of incarceration for Walls-Kaufman, saying that he ""minimized his conduct"" and even claimed ""that he had gone into the Capitol to assist an elderly woman and man,"" a story that prosecutors called a ""fanciful tale.""\n\nThey wrote that Walls-Kaufman was ""slow to acknowledge and obey police officers’ commands to leave the building"" and told one of the officers, “Get your f---ing hand off of me.” They said that Walls-Kaufman remained on Capitol grounds for hours, until at least 5:37 p.m., when he was ordered to leave.\n\n""Walls-Kaufman also described holding a position as a \'gopher\' at Congress’s Joint Economic Committee in 1980 or 1981, and as such he stated he was familiar with the Capitol, and merely walked around to find a way to get out, a claim belied by his thirty minutes inside the Capitol,"" they wrote. During his FBI interview, they said, Walls-Kaufman ""extensively discussed misinformation about the 2020 election being \'stolen.\'""\n\nSmith\'s family, and many online sleuths, believe Walls-Kaufman\'s conduct warrants more serious charges than a misdemeanor ""parading"" count. Smith\'s widow Erin Smith, in a letter to Judge Cobb, wrote that Walls-Kaufman ""should be sentenced to spend the maximum amount of time in jail,"" writing that Walls-Kaufman should have known about the rules about entering federal buildings as a D.C. resident.\n\n""The scuffle between Walls-Kaufman and my husband can be viewed on Jeffrey’s body-worn camera in addition to the record of injuries received during the altercation, which include fractures to his face and sub-orbital cavities, as well the traumatic brain injuries and concussion, all referenced by Dr. Arden,"" Erin Smith wrote. ""When the body camera video is slowed to a frame-by-frame view, Walls-Kaufman struck Jeffrey at least twice in the face with his own baton, after gaining control of it in the Capitol. Walls-Kaufman is a trained martial artist and used his training for malicious conduct that day when he came into contact with police.""\n\nErin Smith wrote that Walls-Kaufman chose to “physically engage with police officers including my husband after trespassing a federal building and using his trained martial arts skills for evil.”\n\nJudge Cobb, after receiving Erin Smith\'s letter, wanted to hear more about the allegations and decided not to sentence Walls-Kaufman on Friday until she heard additional argument.\n\n“The case seems a bit different than the case that I thought I was preceding over when I took the plea,” Judge Cobb said in court Friday. “There’s a big difference between a scuffle ... and an allegation of someone using a baton to strike an officer.”\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Kiok said in court Friday that the government believed that ""there was physical contact"" between Jeffrey Smith and Walls-Kaufman, but said that they did not believe there was sufficient evidence to sustain an assault conviction and that calling it a scuffle was a ""deliberately chosen word.""\n\nKiok said the incident took place during a ""very tense situation"" and that Walls-Kaufman\'s actions did not ""rise to the level"" of an assault charge, and that it was not the government’s position that Smith was struck by the baton in Walls-Kaufman\'s hands.\n\nJudge Cobb said her role was to ""search for the truth,"" and she noted that she went through the video frame by frame. ""I do see [Walls-Kaufman\'s] hands on the baton,"" Cobb said.""I do see Officer Smith fall forward.""\n\nAttorney Hughie Hunt, who is representing Walls-Kaufman in his civil case, called the proceeding ""sentencing by ambush"" and objected to allowing either Erin Smith or Jeffrey Smith\'s father, Richard, to address the court, saying that they were trying to advance a lawsuit in a criminal case.\n\n""What they\'re trying to do is pursue their civil case at a sentencing hearing,"" Hunt said.\n\nKiok said that the family should be allowed to speak before the court, and noted that Jeffrey Smith would be allowed to speak, were he still alive.\n\n""There are people who loved Jeffrey Smith, and they were affected by his passing,"" Kiok said, noting that the story of what happened to the officer went beyond Walls-Kaufman.\n\nJudge Cobb said it was a ""unique situation"" and noted that she could examine the video evidence herself and try to determine what took place and if that should factor into his sentencing.\n\n""I just want to know, factually, did Mr. Kaufman hit anyone,"" she said, noting that there\'s ""a lot of range in terms of what the ultimate sentence will be,"" from probation to six months in prison.\n\nShe set another hearing for May 19, apologizing to the Smith family for the delay, but saying she was inclined to allow Jeffrey Smith\'s family members to speak at the next hearing.'}}",94.08333333333333,1

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/post-misrepresents-legal-power-of-arizona-resolution-on-electronic-voting-machines/', 'Headline': 'Post Misrepresents Legal Power of Arizona Resolution on Electronic ...', 'Snippet': ""The Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state. The state's Democratic ..."", 'Full_text': 'Quick Take\n\nThe Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state. The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

So he issued an order confirming the Arizona election, which Biden won with a 10,457-vote edge over Trump.\n\nFederal court case remains to be heard\n\nFriday’s ruling, however, is not the last word.\n\nWard, in anticipation of the case going against her, already had announced she plans to seek review by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAnd a separate lawsuit is playing out in federal court, which includes some of the same claims made here along with allegations of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThat case, set for a hearing Tuesday, also seeks to void the results of the presidential contest.\n\nIt includes allegations that the Dominion Software voting equipment used by Maricopa County is unreliable and was programmed to register more votes for Biden than he actually got.\n\nLegislative leaders call for audit but not to change election results\n\nAlong the same lines, Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the software and equipment used by Maricopa County in the just-completed election.\n\n“There have been questions,” Fann said.\n\nBut she told Capitol Media Services it is not their intent to use whatever is found to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election.\n\nIn fact, she said nothing in the Republican legislative leaders’ request for the inquiry alleges there are any “irregularities” in the way the election was conducted.\n\n“At the very least, the confidence in our electoral system has been shaken because of a lot of claims and allegations,” Fann said. “So our No. 1 goal is to restore the confidence of our voters.”\n\nBowers specifically rejected calls by the Trump legal team that the Legislature come into session to void the election results, which were formally certified on Monday.\n\n“The rule of law forbids us to do that,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Bowers pointed out, it was the Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted a law three years ago specifically requiring the state’s electors “to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide canvass.”\n\nHe said that was done because Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote nationwide in 2016 and some lawmakers feared that electors would refuse to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Trump, who won Arizona’s race that year.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in a prepared statement. “But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen. David Farnsworth was leading with 64% of the vote to Bowers\' 36% as of Wednesday morning, according to the Arizona secretary of state\'s office. Trump supported Farnsworth in the race, and blasted Bowers as a ""RINO coward"" at a rally last month.\n\nBowers testified on June 21 before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing focused on a plan by Trump\'s allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona.\n\nBowers resisted that effort, telling the committee that the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody.""\n\nEarlier this year, Bowers helped block a bill to empower the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted.\n\nBowers has been a Republican for 30 years. But ahead of a visit by Trump to Arizona in July, the state Republican Party voted to censure him. Kelli Ward, chair of the Arizona GOP, announced the condemnation by the panel on Twitter, saying Bowers is ""no longer a Republican in good standing & we call on Republicans to replace him at the ballot box in the August primary.""\n\nIn an interview ahead of Tuesday\'s primary, Bowers\' told CBS News\' Ed O\'Keefe said he had heard from people who called the censure ahead of a visit by Trump ""cheap theatrics.""

""It\'s not like it\'s a surprise.""\n\nBowers testified that after Trump and his allies made baseless claims of voter fraud in Arizona and called to put forward fake electors, Trump supporters began descending on his neighborhood and family, claiming he was a pedophile and a corrupt politician.\n\nHe said his family had begun to dread Saturdays, when the supporters descended on his neighborhood.\n\n""At the same time ... we had a daughter who was gravely ill, who was upset by what was happening outside and my wife — that is a valiant person, very strong, quiet, very strong woman,"" he said, growing emotional.

It would mandate, for instance, that election workers hand-count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nThe bill would “create a system where losers can set aside the will of the people,” said Alex Gulotta, who runs the Arizona chapter of the voting rights group All Voting is Local. “This is an all-out assault on the freedom to vote.”\n\nThe bill’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. John Fillmore, told CNN in a telephone interview that he’s trying to “ensure the integrity of the voting process.”\n\nUnder his proposal, lawmakers would meet to either “accept or reject election results” following primary and general elections. If legislators reject the results, any qualified voter “may file an action in the Superior Court to request that a new election be held,” according to the bill.\n\nFillmore said lawmakers should possess authority as “representatives of the people” to review the vote count. But, he said, “if there’s a problem, we’re not overturning anything. We’re just trying to put the skids on it and say, ‘This has to be adjudicated.’ “\n\nCurrently, in Arizona, the secretary of state certifies the statewide election results, which also are signed by the governor, state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also would eliminate the state’s widely used early voting-by-mail program and prohibit officials from requiring voters to wear masks at polling places.\n\nFifteen other lawmakers have cosponsored Fillmore’s bill, including state Rep. Mark Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed his bid to become Arizona’s election chief.\n\nFinchem did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\n“The fact that (Arizona lawmakers) are willing to put their names on these democracy-ending bills is a sign of where we’re going to go if we don’t, as a country, start speaking out against this stuff,” Gulotta said.\n\nArizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate last year commissioned an error-plagued hand count of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix.\n\nThe review, undertaken by a Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas, affirmed Biden’s win, but election officials widely discredited the company’s methods and most of its conclusions. The firm recently shut down.\n\nThe state will hold one of the marquee US Senate contests this year as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection to a full term. Kelly, one of the chamber’s most vulnerable incumbents, won a special election in 2020 to fill the seat once held by late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.\n\nIt’s not clear that Fillmore’s measure will gain traction in the legislature.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers, but by narrow margins. As a result, a handful of GOP defectors can sink legislation pushed by others in their party. Last year, a GOP proposal that would have allowed the state legislature to revoke presidential electors chosen through the popular vote and appoint its own slate failed.\n\nFillmore’s proposal – along with his recent remarks suggesting the state return to what he described as 1950s voting practices – sparked rebukes.\n\n“We need to get back to 1958-style of voting,” Fillmore said during a House committee meeting Wednesday – as he argued that voters should cast paper ballots, in person, on Election Day.\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, denounced the comments.\n\n“Republicans have started saying the quiet part out loud: their restrictive voting laws have nothing to do with promoting safe and accessible elections — they just want to drag us back to before the Civil Rights Movement,” Gabrielle Chew, the group’s vice president of communications, said in a statement.\n\nIn the interview with CNN, Fillmore said that by calling it a “1958 bill” he was describing the procedures he prefers, not an era. “In person, no electronics, on paper, count the ballots that day,” he added, ticking off his preferred voting rules.\n\nSo far this year, Arizona Republicans have introduced dozens of bills they say are needed to restore voter trust in elections.\n\nOne, approved by a House committee this week, would ban the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes. Another bill would create a new “bureau of elections” in the governor’s office with a $5 million budget and subpoena powers to “investigate allegations of fraud in any state county or local government election.” (It follows a proposal that Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis first advanced last November to establish a new elections police force with 52 employees.)'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/21/us/jan-6-hearing-trump/rusty-bowers-arizona-trump-jan-6', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Hearings Day 4: Panel Ties Trump to False Electors Plan - The ...', 'Snippet': 'An aide to Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange for the senator to provide fake electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. ... of Arizona’s electors for ...', 'Full_text': 'The hearing demonstrated the human costs of the waves of threats and intimidation set off by Mr. Trump and his supporters as they pressured state officials and election workers to find a way to deprive Joseph R. Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/arizona-fake-electors-kifle-invs/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election ...', 'Snippet': 'But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across ...', 'Full_text': 'They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/analysis-arizona-nightmare-scenario-driving-election-reform-rcna41543', 'Headline': ""Analysis: Here's why Arizona is the nightmare scenario ... - NBC News"", 'Snippet': 'Kari Lake, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, waves to supporters prior to speaking at a news conference after the election on Aug. 3, 2022, in Phoenix.', 'Full_text': ""When politicians, legal experts, and activists say they’re worried that the forces behind Jan. 6th could successfully overturn a future election, the picture they have in mind looks an awful lot like what’s shaping up in Arizona.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's preferred candidates, who are closely aligned with his election lies, are on the verge of taking over the state government from top to bottom after Tuesday’s primaries, potentially sweeping positions from governor (still uncalled) to secretary of state, and taking out the Republican speaker of the state house who stood up to the former president’s attempts to throw out election results.\n\nA fully, or even partially, Trumpified Arizona government could have sown chaos had it been in place in 2020 and followed through on demands from the former president and his allies. The governor or secretary of state might have refused to certify an election, or issued conflicting claims. A state legislature built in Trump’s image could have tried to toss out the results and appoint their own electors. All of this would have set up tough votes for Republicans in the House and Senate in response, who already faced threats to both their careers and lives on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Arizona results, along with similar candidates winning nominations in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan, raise the prospect of more forceful attempts at these tactics in 2024 should the Republican presidential nominee lose.\n\nBut this is a nightmare scenario that the House and Senate were already thinking about long before Tuesday’s results. In fact, the Senate held a hearing on Wednesday on a bipartisan bill to reform the Electoral Count Act designed with exactly this case in mind.\n\nWhile not foolproof, election experts advocating for the legislation argue it would provide a potentially strong defense against every one of the above possibilities.\n\nHere’s how it would work: The bill would require states to abide by their pre-election laws for appointing electors, making it harder to ignore the election results. If, say, the Arizona governor certified the results, but the secretary of state or other officials sent a rival slate of electors, only the governor’s would count. If the governor were the one refusing to honor the results, it would provide a direct path for federal courts, and eventually the Supreme Court to weigh in, and direct Congress to accept their decision. It would also clarify the definition of a “failed election” that was a prerequisite for some attempts to overturn the results in state legislatures.\n\n“The bill would limit the ability of both the legislature and the governor to mess with genuine election results,” Rick Hasen, an elections expert at UCLA's law school who has supported the legislation, told NBC News. “If the governor tries to not follow state law in certifying the election for Trump or someone like him, there is a procedure to get courts involved.”\n\nSeparate from the state concerns, the bill also would address “potential for mischief” in Congress, as Genevieve Nadeau, a lawyer with the nonpartisan group Protect Democracy, put it to reporters Wednesday. It raises the threshold for objections to results and clarifies that the vice president can’t overrule results, which were the two immediate triggers for the Jan. 6th protests that ended with rioters storming the Capitol.\n\nThe House is also considering election legislation, and some experts supportive of the Senate bill's goals have raised technical concerns about some provisions. But the Senate version has significant Republican support already and could become law in some form this year. If it does, the unfolding story in Arizona goes a long way to explaining why.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/arizona-election-changes-ctzn/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona is ground zero for election changes | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Maine Sen.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party’s most extreme election ideas.\n\nFirst up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn’t like.\n\nIn a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a “12-committee lynching.”\n\nArizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take – describing Bowers’ takedown as “killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.”\n\nThen came Rep. Mark Finchem’s resolution this month on Arizona’s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump’s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nBowers’ response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: “Mr. Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.”\n\nBowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history – at least when it comes to some of his party’s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.\n\nHe has described Trump and the then-President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.\n\nBowers told CNN’s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. “I said, ‘No, I won’t,’” Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, “‘3.5 million people voted here, I’m not gonna unilaterally do that.’”\n\nBowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.\n\nArizona at ground zero\n\nEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThey include bills that would:\n\nA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.\n\nAlex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with “holding the line” to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.\n\nBut, he said, “there are actually a lot of bad things” moving through the legislature “that people are being silent about.”\n\nThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.\n\nVoters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, and decide whether to return one of most vulnerable Senate incumbents, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, to Congress.\n\nThe filing deadline for candidates in Arizona is April 4. The primary election for legislative and statewide offices is slated for August 2.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in that primary is July 5.\n\nThe state’s full calendar, along with information on how to check your voter registration status if you live in Arizona, can be found here at the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nLone star on the horizon\n\nControl of both chambers of Congress and a slew of governorships are on the line in upcoming primaries around the country.

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website. And you see, ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says, ‘contribute here,’ you can do $5, $10, $20, $100,” he said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nFauci brought a similarly pointed tone to his exchange with Marshall after the Kansas Republican falsely accused him of withholding financial disclosure forms.\n\n“You’re so misinformed, it’s extraordinary,” a visibly frustrated Fauci told Marshall, calling his financial information “public knowledge” for nearly four decades. After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen. Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe. We would encourage these Republicans to join us.”\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/teakvetenadze/2022/01/11/fauci-clashes-with-rand-paul-at-senate-hearing-you-keep-distorting-the-truth/', 'Headline': 'Fauci Clashes With Rand Paul At Senate Hearing: ‘You Keep ... - Forbes', 'Snippet': 'In their latest fiery exchange, Sen.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China has been at the centre of the debate over COVID-19’s origins. ...

The NIH’s dealings with ...', 'Full_text': 'Researchers are upset over a new policy released by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tighten oversight of its ‘subawards’. These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/', 'Headline': ""NIH director Francis Collins wanted a 'take-down' to stifle ... - STAT"", 'Snippet': 'In October 2020, the U.S. needed scientific debate on how best to control Covid-19. NIH director Francis Collins tried to quash it.', 'Full_text': 'This week, emails released through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Institute for Economic Research revealed what I see as worrisome communication between Francis Collins, Anthony Fauci, and others within the National Institutes of Health in the fall of 2020. At issue was the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter written in October 2020 and eventually signed by thousands of scientists. It argues that Covid-19 policy should focus on protecting the elderly and vulnerable, and largely re-open society and school for others.\n\nAt the time, Americans would have benefited from a broad debate among scientists about the available policy options for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, and perhaps a bit of compromise. The emails tell us why that isn’t what we got.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn email written by Collins, the director of the NIH, which was addressed to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several others read:\n\nCollins appeared on television this week to confirm that the email was authentic, and that he stood by the message. At the time, he believed the Great Barrington Declaration idea of focused protection would result in more deaths than the alternative view of one-size-fits all restrictions. Collins also confirmed that he believed the three authors of the declaration were “fringe” scientists.\n\nOctober 2020, when Collins wrote that email, was a time fraught with uncertainty. Positive results from Pfizer’s ongoing vaccine trial were still four weeks away. Many Americans were fatigued with ongoing restrictions, either imposed by governments or self-imposed. And two dueling documents — the Great Barrington Declaration and the John Snow Memorandum — were released and garnered thousands of signatures. The declaration argued for focused protection and permitting many people to return to normal life. The memorandum favored prolonged one-size-fits all restrictions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the time, I did not take sides, and urged public dialogue between scientists who held both views. We needed “a Covid policy response that engages with people who hold views and perspectives different than our own,” I wrote then.\n\nWhat concerns me about the NIH director’s email and his interview on television is that he appeared unwilling to have this dialogue. Collins’s day job does not make him arbiter of scientific truth, the Pope for all scientists. On questions of unprecedented pandemic policy, he is surely entitled to his opinion — as we all are — but his is just one opinion of many.\n\nWhen it comes to lockdowns or school closures, the answer to the question of whether the benefits exceed the harms and, if so, under what conditions, is far from certain, and scientists will continue to study this for decades. As a good scientist, Collins should have recognized the massive uncertainty around these policies.\n\nCollins’s response to a memo signed by thousands of scientists should not have been to call for an immediate and devastating take down, but to use his pulpit as NIH director to hold a series of public discussions and dialogues. In a world where scientists were trapped in their own homes for months, a series of dialogues — even virtual ones — made available for the broader scientific community, policy makers, and the public would have benefited us all.\n\nIt is possible that through the heat of dialogue, weak premises of the argument for focused protection might have been revealed. But it is also possible that the idea might have attracted even more scientists to devise creative ways to achieve the goal, and who would have recognized the gargantuan trade-offs involved in pandemic policy to date.\n\nIt’s also possible that compromises might have been struck. One tenet of the Great Barrington Declaration was that schools should reopen immediately and broadly. In hindsight, it is now clear that reopening schools could have been done safely, as was done in many European nations in 2020 and in the U.S. in the fall of 2021, even before vaccines became available for children. A public forum between scientists might not have accepted all of the reasoning in the declaration, but might have reached a vital compromise, which would have benefitted millions of children, particularly poor or disadvantaged children — and their parents. Unfortunately, we failed them all.\n\nA dialogue might also have led to better strategies for nursing home residents, the group most decimated by Covid-19. The U.S. did not — but could have — launched a large, registry-based randomized trial in this cohort, similar to the U.K.’s recovery trial. Such a trial might have helped vaccinate more of these at-risk individuals sooner and, with the first hint of vaccine efficacy in November 2020, all participants could have been crossed over to receive vaccines. Other intense strategies to aggressively test nursing home workers may have been proposed and received unanimous support.\n\nJeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, and I called for dialogue and debate among scientists without demonization in April 2020. I’m disappointed to see a few months later that the NIH director, a man uniquely positioned to foster such a debate, had actively sought to thwart and discredit scientists with alternative ideas to the pandemic response. His ad-hominem comment that the authors were “fringe” was unnecessary and unhelpful. In the weeks that followed, more and more mud would be slung against the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, as well as against scientists who held alternative policy views, and favored more and stronger restrictions. The vitriol ensured that the country would not have the dialogue it so desperately needed.\n\nI must admit that I don’t know what would have happened had scientists been more willing to talk to each other. I believe that the world of social isolation — a world of seeing each other through the Post-it-sized Zoom squares — led to dehumanization and irrational hatred, which led to two entrenched policy poles with little room for compromise.\n\nHad Collins, a man who has contributed greatly to science, chosen dialogue instead of contributing to animosity and combativeness, we might have been in a better place today.\n\nVinay Prasad is a hematologist-oncologist, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco, and author of “Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Evidence Harm People with Cancer” (Johns Hopkins University Press, April 2020).'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57268111', 'Headline': 'Covid origin: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory is so disputed - BBC', 'Snippet': 'But on 28 February 2023 the controversial claim that the pandemic might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory - once dismissed by many as a fringe conspiracy theory - resurfaced with FBI Director ...', 'Full_text': 'More than three years after Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how the virus first emerged remains a mystery.\n\nBut on 28 February 2023 the controversial claim that the pandemic might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory - once dismissed by many as a fringe conspiracy theory - resurfaced with FBI Director Christopher Wray\'s comments that the bureau believes Covid-19 ""most likely"" originated in a ""Chinese government-controlled lab"".\n\nIt is the first public confirmation of the FBI\'s classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.\n\nIn response, Beijing accused Washington of ""political manipulation"".\n\nSo what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter?\n\nWhat is the lab-leak theory?\n\nIt\'s a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\n\nIts supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.\n\nThe institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.\n\nThose who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.\n\nThe controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.\n\nWhile many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.\n\nA classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.\n\nBut it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.\n\n""That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,"" Anthony Fauci, President Biden\'s chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.\n\nPresident Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, ""including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident"".\n\nIn May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to ""redouble"" their efforts on this.\n\nWhat do scientists think?\n\nThe issue is still hotly contested.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.\n\nA team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was ""extremely unlikely"".\n\nBut many have since questioned their findings.\n\nA prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.\n\n""We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,"" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.\n\nThey\'re not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.\n\nEven the WHO\'s own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: ""All hypotheses remain open and require further study.""\n\nAnd Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was ""not convinced"" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.\n\nWhat does China say?\n\nChina has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.\n\nResponding to Mr Wray\'s remarks, China\'s foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.\n\nThe US intelligence community had a history of ""misdeeds"" involving ""fraud and deception"", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.\n\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia.\n\nThe Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\n\nProf Shi Zhengli - often referred to as ""China\'s Batwoman"" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.\n\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\n\nOnce the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.\n\nIs there another theory?\n\nYes, and it\'s called the ""natural origin"" theory.\n\nThis argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.\n\nSupporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or ""intermediary host"".\n\nThat idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was ""likely to very likely"" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.\n\nThis hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.\n\nNevertheless, following FBI Director Wray\'s remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.\n\nA natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.\n\n""There\'s been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,"" he said.\n\nProf Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy\'s conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan ""appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus"".\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nGiven the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.\n\nAny confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.\n\n""From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,"" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021\n\n""We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that\'s required.""\n\nBut others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.\n\n""We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can\'t do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,"" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore\'s National University Hospital, told the BBC.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment.

The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit.

By', 'Full_text': 'The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reinstated a grant to a highly scrutinized research organization that studies bat coronaviruses — but the agency has placed several stipulations on the scope of the research and on the organization’s accounting practices.\n\nThe move caps a years-long saga that has thrust the EcoHealth Alliance, a small non-profit organization in New York City, into the political fray for its collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}}",96.38888888888889,1

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system.\n\nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\n\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66983060', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists behind mRNA Covid vaccines - BBC', 'Snippet': 'EPA.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers-heres-how-their-discovery-was-integral-to-covid-vaccine-development-214763', 'Headline': 'Nobel prize in medicine awarded to mRNA pioneers – here’s how their ...', 'Snippet': 'Researchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest.

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses. They published a seminal paper describing their work in 2005.\n\nWhen the pandemic erupted, the vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech used the pair\'s techniques to create highly safe and effective vaccines in record time.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times,"" Rickard Sandberg, a Nobel committee member said Monday in announcing the award.

In addition, the work ""contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.""\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the University of Pennsylvania Monday, Weissman, 64, said the pair had to overcome many obstacles.\n\n""We couldn\'t get funding. We couldn\'t get publications. We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting. And pretty much everybody gave up on it,"" Weissman said. ""But Kati (Karikó) lit the match and we spent the rest of our 20 plus years working together figuring out how to get it to work.""\n\nKarikó, 68, had to overcome big challenges. For years, she went from one low-paying research job to another and even slept in her office at times. She says she was forced to retire from Penn and then commuted to work at BioNTech.

The laureates are Dr. Katalin Karikó (68), an advisor to the German biotech company BioNTech and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA, and Dr. Drew Weissman (64), a professor at the same university. In a press conference on October 2, the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden highly praised the research achievements of the two scientists, stating, ""13 billion doses of the vaccine were administered worldwide, and this saved the lives of millions of people, allowing for society to return to normal.""\n\nDr. Karikó and her colleagues developed a technology that allows mRNA to enter the body without triggering an inflammatory response. They achieved this by replacing certain substances that make up mRNA. Based on this technology, BioNTech collaborated with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and US-based Moderna also developed a vaccine with a similar mechanism. At the end of 2020, less than a year from the start of development, the vaccine was put into practical use and has been widely used in various countries worldwide.\n\nDr. Karikó was born in Hungary during the Cold War and learned molecular biology while living a modest life. After struggling to immigrate to the USA, she met Dr. Weissman, and they continued their research together. Karikó was asleep early in the morning when she received the call from the Nobel Foundation. She later attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania and encouraged female students to follow in her footsteps.\n\nThe two researcher\'s technology allows for practical use of the vaccine in less than a year\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In Japan, the first infected person was confirmed in mid-January 2020, after the new year. The disease quickly spread to various European countries, the USA, and Asia. Meanwhile, the viral genome sequence was disclosed to the public shortly after the first confirmation of infection. Less than a year afterward, BioNTech and Pfizer developed mRNA vaccines. In December of the same year, vaccination with the Pfizer−BioNTech vaccine started in the UK, and the vaccine was quickly disseminated worldwide. Vaccination with the Moderna vaccine followed.\n\nVaccines that protect against viral infections have used viral proteins and other substances that are harmless to the human body to date. However, the drawback is that it takes time for such vaccine development and production (i.e., before practical application). The process typically requires 10 years. The accumulation of basic research on mRNA technology by Karikó and her team is behind the rapid practical application of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nmRNA serves as an \'intermediate\' in the synthesis of proteins based on genetic information encoded in DNA. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this property. Instead of injecting the viral protein itself, its \'blueprint\' is injected, allowing spike proteins to be produced in human cells. The host immune system recognizes this protein and produces antibodies to fight the real virus when it enters the body.\n\nEntering the human body through a \'replacement method\' without being recognized as a foreign substance\n\nUsing mRNA to create vaccines has been around since 1990. However, mRNA is easily degraded and is often considered a foreign substance by the body, leading to strong reactions like inflammation. This made its practical application difficult.\n\nAccording to organizations such as the Nobel Foundation, Karikó and Weissman, who were researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, began their comprehensive research in 1997 to solve the problems associated with the development of mRNA vaccines. They discovered that replacing uridine (a common mRNA component) with pseudouridine (a molecule commonly present in transfer RNA [tRNA]) prevents the mRNA from being recognized as a foreign substance in the human body. The paper on this \'replacement method\' was published in 2005. The two researchers repeated countless experiments before making this discovery.\n\nAs explained by a representative from the Karolinska Institutet at the press conference, ""Dr. Karikó, who is knowledgeable on mRNA, and Dr. Weissman, who has a deep knowledge of immunology, advanced their research by complementing each other\'s expertise.""\n\nWhat background did Dr. Karikó and Dr. Weissman each have, and how did they eventually meet and come to share the same fate of achieving research results that would save many people worldwide&quest; Looking at their backgrounds again, Karikó was born in Hungary on January 17, 1955, received her PhD from the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1982, and moved to the USA in 1985 after working at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. She served as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in the USA and as a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before joining BioNTech in 2013. She has concurrently served as a professor at the University of Szeged and a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania since 2021.\n\nWeissman was born in the USA on September 7, 1959, graduated from Brandeis University in 1981, received his PhD in Immunology and Microbiology from Boston University in 1987, and served as an associate professor at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a professor in 2013.\n\nKarikó, whose research was terminated in her home country, also faced hardship in the USA\n\nKarikó was awarded the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2021 and the Japan Prize in 2022. She held an online lecture at the \'Science Agora 2021\' conference organized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in November 2021. She visited Japan many times for award ceremonies and lectures. In her lectures and media interviews, she looked back on her research career and shared stories regarding the difficulties and hardships she experienced before achieving success in mRNA vaccine research.\n\nAccording to Karikó and documents published about her, she was born in Szolnok, a rural city in Eastern Hungary. The city was devastated by air raids during World War II. However, the city was being rebuilt by the time she was born and growing up. Nonetheless, life was not easy, as supplies were scarce during the Cold War, and there was no running water or television. However, she described her days with her parents (who ran a butcher shop) and her younger sister as ""happy."" As a teenager, she enthusiastically studied biology with her parents\' encouragement. ""I was a curious child. At the age of 16, I decided to become a scientist,"" she mentioned in her acceptance speech for the Keio Medical Science Prize. She then enrolled at the University of Szeged, a university with a long tradition and outstanding achievements, to study molecular biology in depth.\n\nShe received her PhD from the same university and continued her research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. However, in 1985, when she was 30 years old, her research funding was terminated. She searched for research opportunities in European countries and found no institutions willing to accept her. When she found that only Temple University would accept her, she decided to move to the USA with her husband, who was an engineer, and their eldest daughter, who was 2 years old at the time. With only an estimated 200,000-yen equivalent in cash, she made a ""determined journey to the USA"" without considering returning to her homeland.\n\nTaking foreign currency out of Hungary was prohibited at the time. As the story goes, she concealed the cash in her daughter\'s stuffed teddy bear to bring to her new home. Her eldest daughter became a rower in the USA. She won two consecutive gold medals as a US national rowing team member at the Olympic Games in London in 2008 and in Beijing in 2012.\n\nKarikó then moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1989, where she met Weissman, who was working on an AIDS vaccine. Although she began in-depth research on the medical applications of mRNA, research on fragile mRNA did not gain widespread understanding. She experienced a difficult time when her grant funding was terminated. Nevertheless, she continued her research. However, even after she published a paper on mRNA vaccines in 2005, it initially did not garner much attention. Her research career was never smooth sailing.\n\nInteracting with Japanese researchers, and discoveries made by the late Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi contribute to Karikó\'s research.\n\nDr. Karikó repeatedly mentioned Dr. Yasuhiro Furuichi in her lectures. Furuichi was a Japanese molecular biologist who passed away in October 2022 at the age of 81. Furuichi graduated from the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Toyama and received his PhD from the Graduate School of the University of Tokyo. He continued his research on mRNA at the National Institute of Genetics, where he discovered the \'cap\' structure at the tip of RNA in the mid-1970s. The structure was named after its cap-resembling shape.\n\nRNA will not function correctly without this structure. Compared with DNA studies, RNA research, especially mRNA research, has been less spectacular. However, mRNA cannot function without the cap structure, and proteins cannot be produced. For this reason, Furuichi\'s work is considered crucial and is said to have led to the practical application of mRNA vaccines. Unfortunately, Furuichi passed away last year without hearing the news of the Nobel Prize awarded to Karikó. However, he must have been pleased to see the worldwide dissemination of antiviral mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause of their similar research fields, Karikó had interactions with Professor Keiji Itaka, who conducts research on biofunctional restoration at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and Professor Ken J Ishii, who specializes in immunology at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo and is responsible for reviewing Karikó\'s papers. Osaka University posted a message on its website, stating, ""Dr. Karikó has deep connections with researchers at our university, and we at Osaka University, which has strongly promoted this research field for many years, sincerely congratulate both of the two scientists on this honor.""\n\nFurthermore, Director Emeritus/Professor Shinya Yamanaka of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University posted the following message on the Center\'s X (formerly Twitter) account: ""Congratulations on your award. I was deeply impressed after hearing that you have been persistent in your research when I had the opportunity to have a conversation with you. Your groundbreaking invention of the mRNA vaccine technology has saved many people.""\n\nMany of her close Japanese acquaintances have expressed their congratulations, and the common impressions they share are her ""friendly personality"" and ""persistence in diligently pursuing comprehensive research.""\n\nA meeting in line for the photocopier leads to discussion on \'research barriers\'\n\nAfter being selected for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023, Karikó told the Nobel Foundation in a telephone interview, ""At first, I thought someone was making a joke."" When it became clear that it was not a mistake, she and Weissman attended a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAt a press conference, Karikó happily recounted how she met Weissman while waiting in line for a photocopier in 1997. At that time, there were few photocopiers, and the waiting time became a great opportunity to exchange information. In their research, both researchers faced a wall. ""It was nice to talk about various ideas,"" she said. ""Although our laboratories were in different buildings, it was fun to start working together.""\n\nWeissman stated, ""(When I met Dr. Karikó,) I could not get research funding, and nobody was interested in my research. Clinical trials continued to fail. However, I met her, and we worked together for the next 20 years. We never gave up and persevered in our research patiently.""\n\nWhen asked by the moderator for her advice to female students, researchers, and others following in her footsteps, Karikó replied, ""If you want to be in the spotlight, become an actress. If you want to follow orders, the military would be a good choice. However, if you enjoy solving problems, science is for you.""\n\nHigh expectations for application of vaccines to various infectious diseases and cancer treatments\n\nAt a press conference for the Japan Prize laureates, Karikó mentioned their mRNA research, stating, ""We did not originally intend to create a vaccine. Instead, we continued our research, intending to use it for pharmaceuticals. The research to develop a COVID-19 vaccine stemmed from an ethical obligation (to save those infected).""\n\nAs a result, it protected many people worldwide from COVID-19 infection or from the disease becoming more severe. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the technology developed by Karikó and her colleagues ""played a crucial role in controlling the pandemic."" There is a high expectation that the technology they develop will have broad applications.\n\nThe Karolinska Institutet expects the technology to be applied to vaccines for malaria, influenza, and other infectious diseases, and cancer treatment. In her lecture explaining the research findings, Karikó presented research on vaccines that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.\n\nThe institute also highly praised the achievements of the two scientists. However, at the press conference, questions were raised on the safety of mRNA vaccines. In response, a representative of the institute expressed an opinion, stating, ""13 billion people have already been vaccinated, and adverse reactions have been limited, and we do not consider them a significant concern. Actual infection with the novel coronavirus may have a higher risk of long-term health effects."" The representative further noted, ""We need to continue to explain how the mRNA vaccine works (in the body).""\n\nThe Nobel Foundation is known for not awarding any prize in the field of science to research findings that still have safety or ethical concerns. The decision to award a Nobel Prize at this time to the researchers behind the technology of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is a recognition of their safety. However, it means taking on the responsibility of awarding the Prize.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/covid-vaccine-pioneers-awarded-nobel-prize-in-medicine-20231002-p5e984.html', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize in Medicine for scientists who paved the way for COVID vaccines', 'Snippet': 'The discoveries of Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and could be used in the future to create other shots. ...

It starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Pick the right virus protein to target, and the body turns into a mini vaccine factory.\n\nDr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia, described the mRNA vaccines as a “game changer” in helping to shut down the coronavirus pandemic, crediting the shots with saving millions of lives.\n\n“If it hadn’t been for the mRNA technology, COVID would have been much worse,” he said.\n\n“Vaccines generally were the turning point in slowing down COVID and the mRNA vaccines were just so much better than all the others”, noting that the main vaccine used in Britain, made by AstraZeneca, is barely in use anymore.\n\n“We would likely only now be coming out of the depths of COVID without the mRNA vaccines.”\n\nLoading\n\nKarikó was a senior vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to make one of the COVID-19 vaccines. The BioNtech website says that since 2022 she has been an external consultant. She is the 13th woman to win the Nobel Prize in medicine. Weissman is a professor and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovations at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases expert at Exeter University, said that a major advantage of mRNA technology was that vaccines could be made in extremely large quantities since their main components were made in laboratories.\n\nPankhania predicted the technology used in the vaccines could be used to refine vaccines for other diseases like Ebola, malaria and dengue, and might also be used to create shots that immunise people against certain types of cancer or autoimmune diseases like lupus.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday.

Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nRead more: More COVID shots are coming. Will a weary public be more interested this year?\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat ""impressive success story"" alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee ""proper and appropriate,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she\'s been ""passionate about this fragile molecule ever since."" She was exploring DNA\'s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nRead more: Scientist who decoded Neanderthal DNA wins Nobel Prize for insights on human evolution\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci\'s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA\'s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells\' outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\nRead more: Nobel Prize in medicine goes to U.S., U.K. scientists who discovered hepatitis C virus\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,"" Weissman said. ""We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n""They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. ""They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,"" he added. ""It’s a great example of the scientific process.""\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus\' spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n""As important as the vaccine is, if you don\'t take it, it doesn\'t work,"" he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nRead more: 3 scientists who learned how cells react to oxygen levels win Nobel Prize in medicine\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna ""Susan"" Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n""I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,"" she told nobelprize.org on Monday. ""Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.""\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,"" she added. ""It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times. Together they have saved millions of lives, prevented severe COVID-19, reduced the overall disease burden and enabled societies to open up again,"" said Thomas Perlmann, member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute.\n\nThe Nobel Prize was created by wealthy Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who in his will dictated that his estate should be used to fund ""prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind."" The first awards were given out in 1901.\n\nKey development in 2005\n\nKariko was senior vice-president and head of RNA protein replacement at BioNTech until 2022 and has since acted as an adviser to the company. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nWeissman is professor in vaccine research at the Perelman School.\n\nThe two have said they met and began chatting in 1998 while waiting for rationed photocopying machine time.\n\n""Maybe you have some more copy machines now,"" Kariko said at UPenn on Monday. ""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday. The economics prize is announced on Oct. 9.\n\nWinners of this year\'s Nobel Prizes will get an extra 1 million crowns compared to last year, partly because the Swedish crown has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the euro the past decade. The prize money of 11 million Swedish crowns is the equivalent of $1.36 million Cdn.\n\nThe Nobel prizes are presented to the laureates on Dec. 10.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/mrna-discovery-paved-way-covid-19-vaccines-wins-nobel-prize-physiology-medicine', 'Headline': 'mRNA discovery that paved way for COVID-19 vaccines wins ... - Science', 'Snippet': 'The seed for the mRNA vaccine idea was planted in the 1980s, following the development of techniques to generate the genetic strands in the lab. ...
