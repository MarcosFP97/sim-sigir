Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Trump Rejects 'Fake' Jan. 6 Panel: 'Will Nancy Investigate Herself?'
 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

President Trump asks who shot Ashli Babbitt. Every American should know who shot Ashli Babbitt. An unarmed young woman was

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.

For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Continued via threadreaderapp (emphasis ours):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Trump Rejects 'Fake' Jan. 6 Panel: 'Will Nancy Investigate Herself?'
 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.

“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.

“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research

rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: "This Is Worrying Me Quite A Bit": mRNA Vaccine Inventor Shares Viral Thread Showing COVID Surge In Most-Vaxxed Countries
 Body of the Webpage:Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend; the
most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are
not.
"This is worrying me quite a bit," tweeted Malone, embedding the lengthy thread authored by Twitter user @holmenkollin (Corona Realism)
via the 'thread reader' app.
this is worrying me quite a bit.https://t.co/c3uwlLAeCr
— Robert W Malone, MD (@RWMaloneMD) July 17, 2021
Here's what has Malone worried: 
Also take a look at what went on in the 15 most vaccinated countries
worldwide
(SPOILER: doesn‘t look to good)

Cyprus: majority of people vaccinated.
Highest case count in the world. https://t.co/gNb0kpb0hc

What‘s special about small kingdom of Bhutan is that they jabbed 64% of
their population within one week, starting 27/3.
Just a few days after the start of the rollout, cases went up.

Emirates: highest vaccination rate in the whole world.
They just experienced their second highest peak since pandemic began.

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.
They even had hygiene rules, distancing etc
Wait 2 months…
1 in 16 (= higher case rate than any country!) turns out to be
infected.https://t.co/X8EANXaTVQ

„But the vaccine also makes people less transmissible?“
That’s what some studies claimed, yes.
But at what point in time did they measure this effect?
The jabs initially trigger your immune system.
But what if the effect fades and you walk around bar any mucosal protection?

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Continued via threadreaderapp (emphasis ours):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

2024-12-04 19:18:45,476 - Given the headline of a webpage and its body, generate a query that a user of a web retrieval engine would type to verify the correctness of the information provided in the webpage.         Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.
Advertisement - story continues below
An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.

“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.

“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.

Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Continued via threadreaderapp (emphasis ours):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.

For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.
— Kyle Becker (@kylenabecker) July 15, 2021

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Continued via threadreaderapp (emphasis ours):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

2024-12-04 20:14:04,564 - Given the headline of a webpage and its body, generate a query that a user of a web retrieval engine would type to verify the correctness of the information provided in the webpage.         Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

President Trump asks who shot Ashli Babbitt. Every American should know who shot Ashli Babbitt. An unarmed young woman was
shot at point-blank range and killed for trespassing. Any cop in this country they did that anywhere else would already be in prison.

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.

For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Continued via threadreaderapp (emphasis ours):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

What‘s special about small kingdom of Bhutan is that they jabbed 64% of

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

Huh? pic.twitter.com/VOaCNt2zSG

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

President Trump asks who shot Ashli Babbitt. Every American should know who shot Ashli Babbitt. An unarmed young woman was

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.

“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: "This Is Worrying Me Quite A Bit": mRNA Vaccine Inventor Shares Viral Thread Showing COVID Surge In Most-Vaxxed Countries
 Body of the Webpage:Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend; the
most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are
not.
"This is worrying me quite a bit," tweeted Malone, embedding the lengthy thread authored by Twitter user @holmenkollin (Corona Realism)
via the 'thread reader' app.

Here's what has Malone worried: 
Also take a look at what went on in the 15 most vaccinated countries
worldwide
(SPOILER: doesn‘t look to good)

Cyprus: majority of people vaccinated.
Highest case count in the world. https://t.co/gNb0kpb0hc

What‘s special about small kingdom of Bhutan is that they jabbed 64% of
their population within one week, starting 27/3.
Just a few days after the start of the rollout, cases went up.

Emirates: highest vaccination rate in the whole world.
They just experienced their second highest peak since pandemic began.

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.
They even had hygiene rules, distancing etc
Wait 2 months…
1 in 16 (= higher case rate than any country!) turns out to be
infected.https://t.co/X8EANXaTVQ

„But the vaccine also makes people less transmissible?“
That’s what some studies claimed, yes.
But at what point in time did they measure this effect?
The jabs initially trigger your immune system.
But what if the effect fades and you walk around bar any mucosal protection?

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Trump Rejects 'Fake' Jan. 6 Panel: 'Will Nancy Investigate Herself?'
 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

Huh? pic.twitter.com/VOaCNt2zSG
— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) October 27, 2021
After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

President Trump asks who shot Ashli Babbitt. Every American should know who shot Ashli Babbitt. An unarmed young woman was
shot at point-blank range and killed for trespassing. Any cop in this country they did that anywhere else would already be in prison.

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.

“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

 Body of the Webpage:Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend; the
most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are
not.
"This is worrying me quite a bit," tweeted Malone, embedding the lengthy thread authored by Twitter user @holmenkollin (Corona Realism)

Just a few days after the start of the rollout, cases went up.

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.
They even had hygiene rules, distancing etc
Wait 2 months…
1 in 16 (= higher case rate than any country!) turns out to be
infected.https://t.co/X8EANXaTVQ

„But the vaccine also makes people less transmissible?“
That’s what some studies claimed, yes.
But at what point in time did they measure this effect?
The jabs initially trigger your immune system.
But what if the effect fades and you walk around bar any mucosal protection?

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Trump Rejects 'Fake' Jan. 6 Panel: 'Will Nancy Investigate Herself?'
 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

First, Biden said during a speech about infrastructure that a computer spoke to him.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.

An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”

In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.

“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.

“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.

Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR

Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: "This Is Worrying Me Quite A Bit": mRNA Vaccine Inventor Shares Viral Thread Showing COVID Surge In Most-Vaxxed Countries
 Body of the Webpage:Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend; the
most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are
not.
"This is worrying me quite a bit," tweeted Malone, embedding the lengthy thread authored by Twitter user @holmenkollin (Corona Realism)
via the 'thread reader' app.
this is worrying me quite a bit.https://t.co/c3uwlLAeCr
— Robert W Malone, MD (@RWMaloneMD) July 17, 2021
Here's what has Malone worried: 
Also take a look at what went on in the 15 most vaccinated countries
worldwide
(SPOILER: doesn‘t look to good)

Cyprus: majority of people vaccinated.
Highest case count in the world. https://t.co/gNb0kpb0hc

What‘s special about small kingdom of Bhutan is that they jabbed 64% of
their population within one week, starting 27/3.
Just a few days after the start of the rollout, cases went up.

Emirates: highest vaccination rate in the whole world.
They just experienced their second highest peak since pandemic began.

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.
They even had hygiene rules, distancing etc
Wait 2 months…
1 in 16 (= higher case rate than any country!) turns out to be
infected.https://t.co/X8EANXaTVQ

„But the vaccine also makes people less transmissible?“
That’s what some studies claimed, yes.
But at what point in time did they measure this effect?
The jabs initially trigger your immune system.
But what if the effect fades and you walk around bar any mucosal protection?

Headline of the Webpage: U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter
 Body of the Webpage:As the nation's supply chain crisis worsens, three things are becoming apparent: One, there doesn't seem to be a solution around the corner; two, the nation's food supply is now being affected; and three, the crisis appears to have been manufactured by the current regime in order to squeeze working-class Americans, the largest faction of those who voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020.

"Parts of the US are now battling food shortages as worried Americans have emptied supermarket shelves amid the supply chain crisis threatening the nation’s economy and holiday shopping," the New York Post noted this week in an incredibly eye-opening report that is as shocking as it is incredulous.

As the supply crisis has deepened, Americans have begun to do what they did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: They are panic-buying and hoarding goods and foods, making less available for the general market (meaning a lot of folks are going to go hungry very soon -- which will make them extremely angry, frustrated and volatile).

"The surge in demand comes as two of America’s major container ports in California face a massive pandemic-related backlog," The Post added.

Adnan Durrani, the CEO and founder of Saffron Road, a company that produces frozen and shelf-stable meals, told Bloomberg that not only are products disappearing, but prices are skyrocketing as well.

“People are hoarding,” he told Bloomberg. “What I think you’ll see over the next six months, all prices will go higher.”

He went on to say that his company has begun stocking up more inventory than usual, stacking up about four months' worth of supply instead of the normal one or two months.

Meanwhile, Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted in Friday's Situation Update that the situation for many Americans is about to go so far south they are going to have to begin to prepare for collapse conditions now, as well as an entirely different lifestyle:

The world we are about to be plunged into will be unrecognizable by today’s standards. Navigating it successfully will require radical changes in mindset, action and courage. You’ll also need to get good at growing your own food, which is why I’ve just posted this video explaining the technology called “suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponics” which is completely “grid down proof” because it uses no circulation pumps whatsoever. If the power grid fails, the plants don’t die.

“I never imagined that we’d be here in October 2021 talking about supply-chain problems, but it’s a reality,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., who repeated the same complaints and observations of other food retailers, told Bloomberg. “Any given day, you’re going to have something missing in our stores, and it’s across categories.”

Here's the goof: There is plenty of food for all Americans. But as Adams notes in his podcast (watch below) getting it to market is the problem. And that problem isn't getting solved by the Biden regime.

The food/supply chain crises are also beginning to negatively impact some public schools.

“We’ve been struggling with supply-chain issues with different items since school started,” said Theresa Hafner, the executive director of food services at Denver Public Schools. “It just continues to pop up. It’s like playing whack-a-mole.”

And in Chicago, Dill Pickle Food Co-Op ran out of some dry goods because its two principal suppliers have not been able to ship them full orders for weeks.

“Early in the pandemic, panic buying was the cause of many of the out-of-stock situations that grocers experienced,” general manager I’Talia McCarthy noted in an email to store owners this month. “Although the food industry was able to somewhat rebound, the sustained nature of the pandemic, combined with the slow pace of vaccination globally and the recent surge caused by the delta variant, have resurfaced the problem.”

Republicans are onto the Biden regime, though; they are calling out Biden himself over what he's done to make the supply chain problems worse.

Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last week that the administration and Democrats were instead “exacerbating or ignoring the underlying supply chain issues.”

“On infrastructure specifically, the President and the Majority are using the issue to advance their socialist agendas instead of concentrating on addressing congestion and freight bottlenecks,” Graves said. “Their first step now needs to be recognizing that the core purpose of the Nation’s infrastructure network is to move people and goods safely and efficiently.

“Americans are paying a heavy price for these failures, including skyrocketing inflation and the growing scarcity of goods on the shelves that will get worse with Christmas fast approaching,” he added.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Indictment shows it was Hillary who colluded with Russia
 Body of the Webpage:Hillary Clinton and many Democratic Party leaders have never accepted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, accusing him of colluding with Russia to steal the election from her.

But the evidence continues to grow that it was Hillary Clinton who engaged in collusion with Russia while her presidential campaign was threatened by the FBI’s probe of her mishandling of classified information.

It’s been known for some time that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee financed the bogus Steele dossier, which became the premise for an Obama FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that triggered a nearly two-year, $45 million special counsel probe that dominated

Now, the arrest and indictment of the Russian citizen believed to be the dossier’s primary “sub-source” has given the saga a new wrinkle.

Some of the anti-Trump document’s most sensational and now debunked claims, including the infamous “pee tape,” came originally from a Hillary Clinton lieutenant, according to an indictment handed down Thursday by special counsel John Durham’s office.

The Clinton aide is communications consultant Charles Dolan Jr., who is identified in the indictment of Igor Danchenko as “PR Executive-1.”

Danchenko, who was born in Ukraine and has worked in the United States, is charged for concealing the fact that Dolan was one of his sources for the information he gave to former British spy Christopher Steele for the dossier.

The Clinton operative Dolan, meanwhile, has extensive ties to the Russian government, including relationships with “senior Russian Federation leadership,” the Danchenko indictment states.

Among them are President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary and staff.

Dolan, according to Durham, “spent much of his career interacting with Eurasian clients with a particular focus on Russia.”

He handled “global public relations for the Russian government and a state-owned energy company.” And he had a friendly relationship with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and his deputies.

The Clinton-manufactured ‘pee tape’ claim

The indictment spells out Dolan’s role in creating the dossier.

He arranged for Danchenko to meet in Moscow with Russian officials and “sub-sources” who offered information that ended up in the document.

Dolan himself turned out to be the source of the allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel on which President Obama supposedly slept.

The Clinton operative stayed at the hotel and was given a tour by management, the indictment states.

Identified by Durham as “Organizer-1,” Dolan was told by a hotel staffer during a tour of the Presidential Suite that President Trump stayed there.

But, significantly, the “staff member did not mention any sexual or salacious activity.”

Danchenko specifically has been charged for falsely stating Dolan was not a source for “Trump’s stay and alleged activity in the Moscow hotel.”

He also is charged with fabricating the claim that the president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce informed him that Trump was involved in a well-developed “conspiracy of cooperation” with Putin’s regime. The conversation never took place, the indictment concludes.

‘Sights set on the Clinton campaign’

Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy believes the indictment of Danchenko shows Durham “has his sights set on the Clinton campaign.”

“Durham’s charging instruments suggest that the Clinton campaign used its agents to peddle the Trump-Russia rumors to the government and the media, then used the fact that Trump was being investigated as part of its campaign messaging,” he writes in the New York Post.

McCarthy points out that Danchenko worked at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank formerly led by Strobe Talbott, a college friend of Bill Clinton’s who worked in the Clinton State Department.

At Brookings, Danchenko worked with Fiona Hill, who later became a member of President Trump’s National Security Council and was a key witness in the first Trump impeachment over the Ukraine controversy.

It was through Hill, McCarthy notes, that Danchenko became acquainted with Steele, who had been running a London-based intelligence firm after his retirement from MI-6.

McCarthy notes the FBI interviewed Danchenko “because it was desperately trying to corroborate the Steele dossier claims.”

“One question that Durham must be pressing is: What took the bureau so long?”

He recalls that the Obama Justice Department brought the FBI’s sworn claims to the secret federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016 to obtain a permit to spy on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.

The dossier turned out to be the primary evidence submitted to the court.

The FBI is required to verify its allegations before going to court, but it apparently did not interview Danchenko, the main source for the dossier, until January 2017.

By that time, the Obama FBI was obtaining its second 90-day spy warrant.

“It appears that Durham theorizes that the Trump-Russia collusion narrative was a political attack manufactured by the Clinton campaign,” McCarthy says. “Relying on Danchenko, Steele compiled the reports for Glenn Simpson, co-founder of intelligence firm Fusion-GPS, which specializes in digging up political dirt. Fusion-GPS was retained for the Trump project by Perkins-Coie, the Clinton campaign’s law firm.”

In September, Durham indicted former Perkins-Coie attorney Michael Sussmann for making a false statement to the FBI while peddling Trump-Russia allegations that the bureau eventually found unsubstantiated.

Durham alleges that Sussmann concealed the fact that he was working for the Clinton campaign and a tech executive who sought an important government job if Clinton was elected.

Hillary Clinton continues to claim Trump stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller’s highly motivated, Democrat-stacked team came up empty.

In May 2019, for example, she told supporters on the “Evening with the Clintons” national tour with her husband that she had been pouring over Mueller’s report and feared the same “interference” tactics would be “alive and well” in 2020.

“You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” she said to cheers in Los Angeles.

Months later, in a CBS News interview, she called Trump an “illegitimate president” and suggested “he knows” he stole the 2016 election.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, which exposed Clinton’s unauthorized email system, said the Obama administration’s Russia probe was “never about Russia.”

“Targeting of Trump and team served to protect Hillary Clinton (and now Obama, Biden, McCabe, Brennan, Comey, Schiff, etc) and their enablers/co-conspirators in Obama admin from prosecution,” he wrote on Twitter.

Strzok again

Meanwhile, the FBI investigator whose personal animus toward President Trump fueled his efforts to advance the Trump-Russia investigation amid an acknowledged lack of evidence, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday night he’s “concerned” about the indictments of Sussmann and Danchenko.

Peter Strzok said the indictments “have subtle dog whistles to these kinds of pro-Trump conspiracy theories.”

“The indictment makes a point to note that the FBI was unable to corroborate Steele’s reporting,” Strzok claims, “but, at the same time, it neglects to mention that we weren’t able to disprove it either.”

Strzok said the indictments are “seeking to lay out a false narrative about the entire effort of what the FBI and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller did.”

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Looks like New York prosecutors have a witness directly incriminating Donald Trump
 Body of the Webpage:When New York prosecutors criminally indicted Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization two weeks ago, it was clear that prosecutors were looking to flip Weisselberg against Trump. Some pundits insisted that Weisselberg would never flip and that without him, prosecutors wouldn’t be able to criminally indict Donald Trump personally.

But of course these kinds of doomsday narratives are always overly simplistic, relying on the old tired trope that there’s only one possible path to success – and that the one path is doomed. In reality, things are always more complex than that, and there is typically more than one path to success. It turns out another witness in the case has already directly implicated Donald Trump in the crimes that Allen Weisselberg has been indicted for – and her name is also Weisselberg.

It’s long been established that Allen Weisselberg’s former daughter in law Jennifer Weisselberg has been a cooperating witness in the New York criminal case. But what hasn’t been known is what she’s specifically told prosectors – until now.

Daily Beast is reporting that Jennifer Weisselberg told New York prosecutors that Donald Trump “personally guaranteed” the unreported benefits that were used to allow Allen Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes on large chunks of his income. Given that Allen Weisselberg was just indicted for knowingly having been on the receiving end of this fraudulent scheme, it stands to reason that prosecutors will also indict Donald Trump for knowingly having been on the paying end of this fraudulent scheme.

Of course we expect New York prosecutors will aim to indict Donald Trump for a lot more than just the Allen Weisselberg benefits scheme, and that they’ll seek more witnesses than just Jennifer Weisselberg. After all, when they take their big swing at Trump, they’ll want it to be as comprehensive as possible, in order to guarantee a conviction. But Jennifer Weisselberg’s testimony alone lays out the path for Trump to be criminally indicted.

Headline of the Webpage: Enthusiasm for Trump's rally in Arizona dwarfs President Biden's town hall just days earlier
 Body of the Webpage:On Wednesday, President Joe Biden had a town hall event in the Cincinnati area. What most people noticed about the event was some of Biden’s strange answers during the event.

In one viral clip, where he was ostensibly answering a question about when 12-year-olds would get vaccinated, he said, “And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are — why can’t the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact — is, is, is going to be — or, excuse me — we, we, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” Right.

In another clip, he began by talking about vaccine hesitancy and ended up babbling about “whether those aliens are here or not” and whether “there’s a man on the moon or whatever.”

There was another unpleasant political reality those clips obscured, however: The fact that that the town hall was virtually empty.

That’s a mostly empty auditorium to see a president we’re told is unbelievably popular. It may have been a weeknight, but the optics are pretty underwhelming.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, a former president we’re told is radioactive appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, for an election integrity rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point Action.

The optics of Wednesday’s town hall meeting got even more underwhelming for President Biden at that point:

We’ll get into what this means in a bit — and it’s bigger than just Trump being more popular than people think (and Biden being less popular than the media cheerleaders make him out to be). But first the particulars.

According to The Hill, Trump was speaking at the “Rally for Election Integrity,” which was in support of both election integrity laws and the ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where Pheonix is the county seat.

During his remarks, Trump thanked “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate” who’ve stood behind the audit.

“I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy; I’m trying to save American democracy,” Trump said to wild applause, according to The Arizona Republic.

While the atmosphere was lively inside, it began hours before as Trump supporters lined up to get into the event, held at the 5,000-seat Arizona Federal Theatre:

Conservative pundit Todd Starnes noted that many would-be participants were being turned away after the venue reached capacity:

Even Trump remarked on the crowd during his speech.

“What a crowd, what a crowd,” Trump said. “And if you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. It’s an incredible group. So thank you to the people outside, we love you.”

The obvious takeaway is the difference in the enthusiasm gap between President Biden and former President Trump. Even though the media loves telling us Biden is a historic president who won a historic election and is doing historic things, look at the crowd that showed up in Cincinnati.

Given his rate of gaffery at these town hall events, you’d think at least some people would show up to watch him wipe out, if not to see a sitting president of the United States. Meanwhile, despite no Twitter account, no social media presence and overwhelmingly negative media coverage, Trump is outdrawing Joe Biden easily — something that should worry Democrats hoping they’d be rid of Trump in 2022 and 2024.

However, what Trump was in Phoenix to speak about could be just as important for the midterms and the next presidential election, as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk pointed out in a tweet:

“Donald Trump is pulling bigger crowds after leaving office than Joe Biden has since he took office—or at any point during the campaign,” he wrote. “And to Republicans, take note—this is a rally to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS. Listen to your base. Secure the vote.”

Democrats and their media propagandists like to describe anything that has to do with election integrity as part of the so-called “big lie.” And yet, it draws this kind of a crowd. For Democrats and squishy Republicans, these aren’t pictures you want to look at.

For Biden, meanwhile, they encapsulate why he should have a lot to worry about if he is a candidate in 2024. He can’t generate any kind of enthusiasm.

Trump can and election integrity does. The crowds don’t lie.

Avoid using stopwords. Queries should have between 3-5 words length. Answer ONLY with the query. Headline of the Webpage: Trump Rejects 'Fake' Jan. 6 Panel: 'Will Nancy Investigate Herself?'
 Body of the Webpage:With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., moving forward with the Jan. 6 Select Committee with only Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans not approved by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., former President Donald Trump called out Pelosi's conflict of interest.

"Nancy Pelosi is spending a great deal of time, effort, and money on the formulation of a Fake and highly partisan January 6 Committee to ask, 'what happened?'" Trump wrote Monday night in a statement from his Save America PAC.

"Will Nancy investigate herself and those on Capitol Hill who didn't want additional protection, including more police and National Guard, therefore being unprepared despite the large crowd of people that everyone knew was coming?"

Numerous Republicans have not only called out Pelosi's "unprecedented" blocking of Republican select committee nominees, but they also called her a "target" of any Jan. 6 investigation because she was in charge of Capitol security. Also, as Trump noted, she rejected National Guard before the protest and the joint sessions of Congress to certifying the 2020 presidential election and consider debate on allegations of election fraud in key battleground states.

"Will Nancy and her Committee study the massive voter fraud that took place during the 2020 presidential election, particularly in swing states, that was the reason hundreds of thousands of people came pouring into Washington and, therefore, must be a big factor in the final committee report?" Trump's statement continued.

"Now would be a very good time to study the large scale voter fraud in our presidential election."

Newsmax hosts and White House and Washington, D.C., correspondents have also noted full transparency of the events of Jan. 6 are compromised because of the withholding of surveillance footage of the protest at the Capitol and the storming of it.

"Will Nancy release the thousands of hours of tapes so we can see the extent to which ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter played a role, while also revealing 'who killed Ashli Babbitt?'" Trump's statement continued. "A real and thorough investigation of this must be done — and what about all of the violence, murders, riots, and fires that took place in Democrat run cities throughout the United States by ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, with virtually no consequence for this death and destruction?"

Trump has also revealed earlier this summer the protected shooter of Babbitt was allegedly a "head of security" for a top House Democrat, adding potential conflicts of interest for Pelosi and Jan. 6 Select Committee Democrats. Babbitt, an unarmed U.S. veteran, was shot as she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the Capitol. Despite myriad claims five Americans died in the unrest at the Capitol, she was the lone fatality attributed to the melee. The other deaths were ruled to have been suicides and natural causes.

The unnamed Babbitt shooter has been cleared from any investigation by the Biden administration's Justice Department, which Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, rebuked on Newsmax's "Spicer & Co." earlier Monday night as "all too happy" to abuse power.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has alleged a Democrat "cover-up" in a previous appearance on Newsmax.

Trump's statement concluded with a rebuke of partisan attacks on him, his backers in Congress, and Make America Great Again/America First supporters.

"Will Nancy look into the vicious partisan investigations of Conservatives and Republicans that are taking place by prosecutors all over the Country?" Trump's statement read. "The five-year investigation of me, and all that so many have been through, including the fake Russia, Russia, Russia charge, and including the local Democrat-controlled New York prosecutors who work around the clock to get President Donald Trump, while murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers go free!"

Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee is set to first hear from four law enforcement officers about defending the storming of the Capitol. The hearing will start at 9:30 a.m. ET with opening statements from Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. – the chair of the select committee – and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

Cheney was removed from her past position of GOP leadership in the House for her breaking from the party and voting to impeach the former president for incitement of insurrection after Trump left office.

 Body of the Webpage:The bad guys just got what they deserved. So, after an emotional and sad day, the worst of the insurrection party decided to stage a protest at the DOJ. Perhaps you heard these monsters were planning it. Only things did not go quite like the terror team thought they would.

The goal of the insurrection supporters was to demand answers about the Capitol terrorist prisoners. Why were they still in jail? What was the government doing to them?

I can answer these questions. They’re in jail because they’re cruddy and rotten psychopaths who tried to overthrow our government. It would seem that the terror team is on the side of the insurrectionists-not surprising.

So, those human scumbags went to do their evil little thing. Only the American people refused to have it. Protesters showed up. They showed up with loud voices and…..whistles.

The temper tantrums of the evil insurrection party members were drowned out by screams, catcalls, and some very deafening whistle noise.

High-haired Matt Gaetz was called a “pedophile.” Yay!

The crowd labeled the evil terrorist supporters “traitors.” Yay!

Many of the protesters also sang. Yay!

The vile GOP members couldn’t get a word in edgewise. Whenever they tried, the whistle would sound. Never let it be said that our fellow Americans lack balls. This joke of a GOP protest ended with the insurrectionists being chased away. The bad guys got what they deserved.

Headline of the Webpage: Banks: Pelosi Doesn't Want 'Tough Questions' Because She's Responsible for Breakdown of Security on Jan. 6'
 Body of the Webpage:On Sunday morning, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) spoke to Martha MacCallum on "Fox News Sunday" about the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot. The congressman was one of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) five picks for the committee, though McCarthy pulled all five after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rejected Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Throughout the segment, Rep. Banks emphasized that Pelosi objected to such picks because she was afraid of "tough questions." She's also "only interested in a narrative," and answers which fit that narrative, Banks offered, and that "that's all that this comes down to," which includes how "she has already predetermined a narrative about Donald Trump, about Republicans."

Banks found out over Twitter that Pelosi objected to him being picked, he shared with MacCallum. Earlier that day he was meeting with the head of the U.S. Capitol Police Union. "They weren't prepared for it, they weren't trained for it, and, maybe most important of all, they weren't equipped for it," he said, noting the police "lacked equipment" when it came to "something like what at that point should have been expected would occur."

Banks explained how it all comes back to Nancy Pelosi because as the speaker, she "has more control and authority and responsibly over the leadership of the Capitol Police than anyone else in the United States Capitol." He went onto explain "she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the Capitol that happened on January 6th."

Banks made it clear that he wanted to ask such questions to do with the vulnerability of the Capitol on that day, noting how "three weeks before January 6th there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the Capitol Police were aware of."

Another point of concern also existed with the ramifications of Pelosi objecting to Banks and Jordan, which meant objecting to their questions. "Well, again, it's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That's why she's picked the group that she's already picked," he answered when MacCallum showed a clip of Rep. Liz Cheney's (R-WY) calling the "rhetoric around this from" Banks "disgraceful."

"And anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will--will be stuck to her-- her narrative, to her point of view," Banks said, referring to Pelosi. "There won't be another--another side. And that's--in the history of the Congress, something like this has never happened before. In the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the House deny the -- the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee. It's never happened before. It's a break in precedent," Banks warned. "And as everyone in America knows, you have a majority view, a minority view. That's the whole point of our committee structure in the Congress."

He also laid the blame on Pelosi when it comes to a report coming out of the Homeland Security and the Rules Committee from June, which "talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the breakdown of security on January 6." Banks raised concerns about the documents the speaker's office did not release, which he suggests aren't being released because they show that "the speaker was involved and the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred in January 6th."

Congress had also considered investigating the Capitol riot in the form of a special commission. While it passed the House with bipartisan support, and did have some Republican support in the Senate, it was ultimately filibustered by Republicans. Some critics in their opposition referenced such other investigations taking place.

News was later leaked by a staffer that Pelosi was going with a select committee, which she confirmed a few days later. Only two Republicans, Reps. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of it.

After previously playing coy, Speaker Pelosi on Sunday officially named Rep. Kinzinger to fill one of the spots, which he accepted. Cheney had been chosen and accepted last week.

Headline of the Webpage: Biden Gang Reportedly Running Two Secret Lists Used to Prevent Outspoken Conservatives from Owning Guns – Laura Loomer Speaks Out on This Injustice
 Body of the Webpage:Representative Paul Gosar accused Biden’s government of maintaining two secret lists that it uses to strip its enemies of their constitutional rights.  These enemies, like activist and congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are those Americans who love God, their country, and freedom.Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) released a letter this week he sent to Biden’s corrupt Attorney General Merrick Garland addressing the secret lists he has put in place illegally and unconstitutionally.
Here is Gosar’s letter:
Activist Laura Loomer released the following statement regarding these secret government lists:BREAKING: Congressman Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has drafted a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray inquiring about why they’re illegally red flagging conservatives through the secret FBI NICS database.Congressman Gosar asked the FBI whether or not they were trying to entrap me when they illegally red flagged me, BANNING me from ever being able to own or possess a firearm, without ever notifying me when they placed me on the NICS database after I confronted former FBI Director James Comey.I’m pleased to announce I will be working with Congressman Gosar on ANTI-RED FLAG legislation so the FBI & DOJ can no longer politically target Americans & strip them of their Second Amendment Rights!Thank you Congressman Gosar! I’m proud to have Congressman Gosar’s endorsement in my FL Congressional campaign. #AmericaFirst
Loomer also shared with TGP.First they ban you on social media. Then the banks ban you. Then you’re banned from owning a gun.I’m the test case and the original canary in the coal mine for what Big Tech and the Biden regime want to make mainstream for all Consevative Americans.I’m running for Congress, and when I win I’m going to fight like hell to make sure what has happened to me NEVER happens to you or any other American EVER AGAIN!#LauraLoomerForCongressThis should never happen in America.  We must end the Biden gang’s assault on America for the sake of our children’s future.

Headline of the Webpage: Foreign News Media Laughs at Joe Biden: He 'Needs a Retirement Home and a Warm Bowl of Soup'
 Body of the Webpage:As President Joe Biden continues to make public blunders nearly every time he speaks, the United States is losing respect on the world stage. In
order to see this happen in real time, you just need to turn on a foreign news channel.
Last week on Sky News Australia, Rita Panahi was hosting “The Friday Showdown.” On the show, she jokingly dubbed one of her segments
“What in God’s name is Joe Biden trying to say?”
Panahi went on to show two videos of bizarre blunders that occurred just last week.

Later in the week, Biden slurred his words to the point they were indiscernible while speaking at a campaign event for Virginia gubernatorial
candidate Terry McAuliffe.

Huh? pic.twitter.com/VOaCNt2zSG

After showing the clips, Panahi gave her own take on Biden, and she did not pull any punches.
“This man needs a retirement home and a warm bowl of soup, not access to the nuclear codes,” she said. “When he’s not making a fool of himself
misreading auto-cues, Biden is making utterly incomprehensible decisions that further weaken the U.S.”
To support this second point, Panahi brought up a Thursday article from The Wall Street Journal in which the outlet reported Biden planned to give
about $450,000 per person to immigrant families who were separated at the border under former President Donald Trump.

“Of course, the Biden administration has completely lost control of the southern border with more than 200,000 illegal immigrants encountered
crossing a month — and that’s the ones encountered,” Panahi said.
She continued by saying Biden’s inability to even speak clearly proves he is completely unqualified to deal with this crisis or any others facing
America.
“The man is in need of a lie down, a pudding, time with his grandchildren. He has no business being in the White House,” she said.This video from Sky News Australia should be concerning to Americans for a couple of reasons.
First, Panahi raised some legitimate concerns about this president’s ability to lead the country.
Anyone who has been watching the news knows that Biden’s gaffes are both frequent and troubling. As America faces a mounting list of problems,
it is fair to wonder whether Biden has the mental or physical capacity to address them.
Second, even if you do believe Biden is fit to be president, the fact is that optics also matter. When Biden continues to slur his words and say
things that make absolutely no sense, it weakens America’s image.

The United States holds itself as the most powerful nation in the world, yet news outlets thousands of miles away are mocking its leader. That is not
a recipe for success.

Headline of the Webpage: 'Falsified Data': Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal
 Body of the Webpage:A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III Covid-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical
publication that poor practices at the contract research company she worked for raise questions about data integrity and
regulatory oversight.
Brook Jackson, a now-fired regional director at Ventavia Research Group, revealed to The BMJ that vaccine trials at several sites in Texas
last year had major problems - including falsified data, broke fundamental rules, and were 'slow' to report adverse reactions.
When she notified superiors of the issues she found, they fired her.
A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the
company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on
adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by
the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook
Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.
Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. -The BMJ
Poor laboratory management
Jackson, a trained clinical trial auditor with more than 15 years' experience, says she repeatedly warned her superiors of poor
laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. After she was ignored, she started documenting problems
with the camera on her mobile phone.
One photo, provided to The BMJ, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box.
Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open,
potentially unblinding participants. Ventavia executives later questioned Jackson for taking the photos.
The unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial's design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either
Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff - including the
principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants' charts and accessible to
blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants
already enrolled.
Jackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company
couldn't quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.
"In my mind, it's something new every day," they said, adding "We know that it's significant."
According to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry - as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.
"The expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding
queries older than three days in yellow. Examples included two individuals for which “Subject has reported with Severe
symptoms/reactions … Per protocol, subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an
UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” According to the trial protocol a
telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”
FDA Inspection woes
Other documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August
2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to "Go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc."
One of the employees was "verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry," a note reveals.
During the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On
former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact
expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.
"People working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits," Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does
anything except review paperwork - usually months after a trial is over. "I don’t know why they’re so afraid of them," she added - saying that
she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.
"You would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that."
FDA notified
Jackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full
trial's 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns
over issues she had witnessed, including:
Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Hours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which
may result.
That said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine
out of the trial's 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia's operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the
December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.
Other employees corroborate Jackson's complaints
Two former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed 'broad aspects' of Jackson's account.
One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never
experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.
“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little
different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”
She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.
After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked
enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed
symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August
this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-
19.)
“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy
mess.” -The BMJ
The second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.
Since her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her
a text message, which reads "everything that you complained about was spot on."
Meanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company
for four other vaccine clinical trials.

Headline of the Webpage: “Zero COVID” Catastrophe: Participating Nations See New Records Across the Board
 Body of the Webpage:Zero Covid, the idea that heavy-handed government edicts and population controls can permanently eliminate a coronavirus from a country, is now failing spectacularly
everywhere it is being tried.
According to Zerohedge, Zero Covid nations are seeing explosions in Covid-19 cases across the board. The widely praised “success story” countries that followed the radical
ideology that is Zero Covid have not only failed to contain a virus, but are now witnessing the uncontrolled spread of that virus in their population centers.
Australia is arguably the most dedicated large nation to a Zero Covid strategy. The country has been closed off from the vast majority of the world. Zero Covid has been an
unmitigated disaster, as Canberra’s elimination strategy has unsurprisingly failed to permanently move cases to zero. 
The countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand and New Zealand have also been using strict lockdowns, Covid surveillance systems and contact
tracing measures. They have been labeled a Zero Covid “success story” or “model nations” by the press. But recently, they have experienced an explosive increase in COVID-
19 cases without exception, or set their own Covid case records.

Headline of the Webpage: Chicago Chamber Of Commerce Rages As Average Unemployed Illinoisan Parent Earns $35/Hour Sitting On The Couch
 Body of the Webpage:Illinois employers are hurting from a lack of workers while the state unemployment rate remains high. When a parent can stay
home and make $51,627 on unemployment, the prospects of getting more workers back to work this summer appear dim.
Illinois’ unemployment rate rose to 7.2% July 15, the 8th worst in the nation, at the same time employers are having trouble filling job
vacancies.
The average Illinoisan earns $55,770 a year at work. If that person stayed home with their kids and collected unemployment, it
would be $51,627.
For a parent earning around the state average, that’s $4,000 less for deciding not to work, and with no child care or transportation
expenses.
Crunch the numbers another way and add federal stimulus, and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce calculated an unemployed
worker receives $35 an hour.
“In Illinois alone, there are tens of thousands of unfilled jobs. Employers are offering substantially higher wages, employment
bonuses and taking other steps to encourage people to return to work,” the chamber wrote in an open letter to Gov. J.B.
Pritzker.
“The problem is employers cannot compete with the approximate $35 per hour unemployed workers have received
over the last four months as a result of enhanced UI benefits, tax credits, and stimulus payments.”
Illinois’ 7.2% unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 5.9%. Government policies are not helping reduce it.
Unemployed Illinoisans before the COVID-19 pandemic were required to upload a resume on IllinoisJobLink.com, a state-run job bank. The
state rescinded the requirement for those unemployed by the pandemic. Currently, employers have posted over 120,000 jobs on the state
jobs site; residents have only posted 37,834 resumes.
This month, Washington joined a growing list of states to require unemployment recipients to search for a job. Illinois will not be joining
them.
“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under people that have certainly legitimate reasons for remaining on
unemployment,” Pritzker said when asked about the reform.
He also promised to keep paying the extra $300 in federal pandemic unemployment relief through the federal expirationdate of Sept.
6. Over half of states are already putting an early stop to the additional $300 over concerns it is incentivizing people to stay unemployed.
Pritzker’s solution has been to ponder paying people bonuses for returning to work. The program has been used in Arizona,
Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma and replaces extended benefits with a $1,000 bonus received upon return to work. Even with the
bonuses, recipients will still have trouble making more by working than by staying home.
Maximum unemployment benefits – which are set based on the average wage of a person paying into unemployment – are currently $805
per week for single, childless Illinoisans. That is $505 from the state and $300 from federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment

Compensation funds. Because lower wage individuals are more likely to collect unemployment benefits, average unemployment payouts
are lower than what the average worker would make on unemployment. Across all recipients, the average benefit paid out was $364.76 as
of May 2021 plus the additional $300.
A recipient with a child can receive up to $993 in weekly benefits. The state gives a maximum of $693 to individuals with children,
regardless of how many children, plus the $300 from the federal government. Parents as of July were also eligible to receive their child tax
credit monthly, which has also been increased per child and per month.
So go to work, average $55,770 and pay for child care, transportation and taxes. Stay home, save the expenses, collect tax
breaks and get up to $51,627.
It would be nice if Illinois didn’t leave people questioning their work ethic.

 Body of the Webpage:After nearly eight months of questions and controversy surrounding the events of Jan. 6, the most prominent question remains unanswered: Who
killed Ashli Babbitt?
Michelle Witthoeft, Babbitt’s mother, says Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is responsible for her daughter’s death.
“My daughter was a California constituent, and Nancy Pelosi not only, I feel like, orchestrated the death of my daughter.”

“I’ve reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office several times, and she has yet to call me back because she’s too busy playing in her clubhouse with all
of her elite people,” Witthoeft said.
She also reminded Nancy of her place in the government.

“You know, it’s the people’s house. It’s not your house, Nancy. It’s the people’s house. That’s my message to Nancy Pelosi,” Witthoeft said.
Despite the many claims of violence that occurred on Jan. 6, evidence has yet to surface suggesting Babbitt herself was reckless or threatening.
Advertisement - story continues below
An earlier report from The Western Journal found that there had been no documented reports of Babbitt starting fires or attacking police officers.
Her mother wants to know who is responsible for her death.
“The Capitol Police should be held accountable like every other police department in the country.”
Witthoeft isn’t the only one fighting for Babbitt.
In a July 1 statement, former President Donald Trump asked only the following question: “Who shot Ashli Babbitt?”

President Trump asks who shot Ashli Babbitt. Every American should know who shot Ashli Babbitt. An unarmed young woman was
shot at point-blank range and killed for trespassing. Any cop in this country they did that anywhere else would already be in prison.

Trump’s statement brought national awareness to the issue, causing Babbitt’s name to trend on Twitter.
Back in April, Babbitt’s family announced that they were suing the Capitol Police for “at least $10 million” in damages.
Advertisement - story continues below
For the suit to be successful, the family would have to prove that the officer responsible had used “constitutionally unreasonable” force against
Babbitt.
On April 14, after conducting an investigation, the Department of Justice released a statement on the matter.
“Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,” the DOJ said.
“As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or
even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required under Section 242.”
Advertisement - story continues below
In the era of police accountability and transparency, why has the death of Ashli Babbitt been swept under the rug? No one is marching in the
streets for her. No one is burning down police precincts.
Despite what the establishment media and Democratic politicians have claimed, the events of Jan. 6. — while shameful and wrong — did not
constitute an “insurrection.”
The continued problem from that day has been the government’s lack of transparency about Babbitt’s death.
People want answers. They won’t forget — and Babbitt’s mother isn’t going to let them.

Headline of the Webpage: AZ State Senator Demands Biden Electors Be Recalled, New Election Be Held After Shocking Audit Revelations
 Body of the Webpage:In the wake of the Maricopa County audit of the 2020 election results, one GOP Arizona state senator is demanding that the state’s electors —
which went for President Joe Biden — be recalled, and a new election be conducted in the state.
In a Twitter thread on Thursday, state Sen. Wendy Rogers said the revelations from the audit were severe enough that she thought the election
needed to be rerun.
“I have heard enough,” Rogers tweeted.

“With the tens of thousands of ballots mailed without being requested, the over ten thousand people who voted after registering after November
3rd, the failure of Maricopa to turn over the 40% machines, the passwords that Dominion still refuses to turn over, & tens of thousands of
unauthorized queries demonstrating how insecure the election was, I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be
conducted,” she wrote.
“Arizona’s electors must not be awarded fraudulently & we need to get this right.”

On Friday, Rogers further called for an audit of all 50 states’ results from the 2020 election.
#AuditAll50States to #DrainTheSwamp and put #AmericaFirst!!! — Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) July 17, 2021
Rogers was quoting from a statement by the cybersecurity firm auditing the election in Maricopa County — Cyber Ninjas. According to
Newsweek, Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan told the Arizona state Senate this week, “Thousands of names were added to the voting rolls after
election day, but are recorded as casting a ballot in the 2020 election.”
Logan also told the Senate that up to 74,000 records for mail-in ballots were missing from Maricopa County — Arizona’s most populous
jurisdiction, home to Phoenix. The ballots were received but there was no record of them being sent by elections officials, according to Logan.
NOW I get why Maricopa County and Biden admin fought tooth and nail to prevent an independent audit. 74,000 absentee ballot
mail-in records missing, 25K duplicates, voter rolls a mess, bleed throughs, tens of thousands of ballots on demand, admin
passwords issues. A disaster.
— Kyle Becker (@kylenabecker) July 15, 2021

The lead auditor also said his findings lent support to a theory that’s taken on the name “SharpieGate.”
Ballots in Maricopa County are supposed to use a type of paper called VoteSecure which doesn’t let markers like Sharpies bleed through the
sheet. However, auditors reportedly found that Sharpies caused significant voter discrepancies in the Maricopa County tally.
Another auditor and digital security expert, Ben Cotton, said the security on Maricopa County’s election systems was so poorly secured it could
be hacked in under 10 minutes.
Advertisement - story continues below
“We know through public record, public statements, that an element of the election system was actually compromised or breached during the
course of the November 2020 election,” he said.
“The registration server that was public-facing did have unauthorized access to that in cybersecurity terms, it was breached. We know that the
county has accepted that as an unauthorized breach because they actually issued a letter to a small subset of the voters who were affected by that
breach.”
Cotton also said auditors found 37,000 queries on an elections system in one day for using a blank password; the system only contained eight
accounts, making this highly unusual activity on the system, to say the least. The issue is that chain of custody information might have been
compromised because several individuals might have gotten access and run multiple processes under one account.

“Accountability is out the window, from an individual aspect,” Cotton said.
Auditors also said 11,326 voters that weren’t on Nov. 7 voter rolls were suddenly on the voter rolls on Dec. 4.
Now, granted, the likelihood that all 50 states will be audited or that Arizona’s 11 electoral votes will be decided by a new election is roughly
similar to your chances of finding both Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper alive, well and managing a Quiznos in Cincinnati that they co-own.
Still, if there’s something behind Cyber Ninjas’ allegations, the voting process in Arizona needs to be put under the microscope. The 11 electoral
votes in the state aren’t likely to swing — but there are plenty of people like state Sen. Wendy Rogers who don’t believe the voting process was
on the up-and-up — and it’s not because they believe “the big lie” or are carrying water for QAnon.
Advertisement - story continues below
Instead, it’s people who are losing faith in our election processes — and are seeing Democrats trying to erode that faith further by passing an
electoral power-grab at the federal level. That’s going to be poisonous for our republic going forward. It’s something that needs to be squared
away to restore trust in the integrity of our elections.

Headline of the Webpage: Rand Paul is left speechless after Dr. Fauci tears into him for lying in Senate hearing
 Body of the Webpage:So desperate are they to cover up Donald Trump’s outsized role in botching the federal response to the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans have decided to scapegoat one of the few officials to
consistently approach the pandemic in a responsible fashion: Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Today, the Senate 
 on whether or not the National Institutes of Health provided funding for a kind of research that right-wingers like Senator Rand Paul (R-TX) want us to believe helped
cause the coronavirus outbreak. Called “gain-of-function research” the process revolves around studying how changes to the nature of a virus can make it more effective at transmitting itself to new
hosts. Conservatives have rallied around the idea that the NIH backed such research and that it led to the pandemic despite Fauci denying such allegations during a previous Senate testimony.
During his testimony today, Fauci locked horns with Senator Paul. As expected, Paul tried to push his Fox News-friendly narrative about the NIH and gain-of-function and as expected the accomplished
Dr. Fauci had no problem dismantling his bad faith fishing expedition.
“Knowing it’s a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” asked Paul.
“Senator Paul I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement,” said Fauci without hesitation. “This paper that you’re referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the
chain as not being gain-of-function. What was– Let me finish!” said Fauci as Paul rudely interrupted.

“You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function,” said Paul, who is an ophthalmologist, not a virologist.

“That is correct and Senator Paul you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,” said Fauci, visibly irritated by the senator’s weaponized ignorance. “You do
not know what you are talking about. Okay, you get one person…” Fauci tried to explain before Paul interrupted him.
Paul continued his grandstanding rant by rambling about virology concepts that he clearly doesn’t fully understand. Fauci then tried to explain the details about the science and research funding which
Paul so clearly couldn’t care less about.
RAND PAUL: Knowing it's a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement where you said the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?
FAUCI: I've never lied before Congress & I don't retract that statement … you don't know what you're talking about pic.twitter.com/UtWoO2KHsb
— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 20, 2021
Fauci wasn’t done reprimanded Senator Paul just yet though.
“I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator,” said Fauci. “Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments, that were given in the annual reports, that were
published in the literature it is molecularly impossible–” Fauci said before Paul once again interrupted him to spew his talking points.
Fauci finally got a chance to make his point. He explained Paul’s implication that the NIH is responsible for COVID-19 and the ensuing deaths simply doesn’t make sense to anyone who actually
understands the science.
“And if anybody is lying here senator it is you,” said Fauci. Paul was left speechless and just sipped his water as he tried to recover from Fauci’s blunt words.

Headline of the Webpage: NIH Director Shredded Over Risky Research In Wuhan After CNN Interview Goes Sideways
 Body of the Webpage:While most corporate media outlets are throwing softballs at Dr. Anthony Fauci over revelations that the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, Fauci's 'boss' - NIH Director Francis Collins - wasn't so lucky.
In a blistering Sunday night interview, CNN's Pamela Brown (credit where it's due) absolutely grilled Collins over the NIH's funding of New
York-based nonprofit, EcoHealth alliance, which performed textbook Gain of Function research - genetically engineering bat coronaviruses
so they can infect humans. Last week the NIH admitted that EcoHealth violated the terms of a grant by failing to report their achievement
(which EcoHealth denies), sending both Fauci and Collins into full damage control over the weekend.
Now, the official story is that while EcoHealth violated their contract, and are allegedly 'in trouble' for failing to report their achievement, the
NIH and NIAID (Collins and Fauci) maintain that the research still wasn't risky enough to qualify for enhanced oversight.
CNN's Brown didn't let Collins get away with his carefully crafted talking points - repeatedly pressing him over what else the NIH may be
funding that they don't know about, and asking why the American people should trust them after last week's revelation.
Breaking down the interview is Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin - who in March revealed in his book: "Chaos Under Heaven:
Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century" that the (NIH) "had funded a number of projects that involved WIV scientists,
including much of the Wuhan lab's work with bat coronaviruses." In April, Rogin revealed that in 2018, diplomats with the US State
Department warned over safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat COVID. In short - few journalists are as qualified as Rogin to opine
on what's going on.
Jumping right into it (video at the bottom):
Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR
TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had done research
making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every
rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll explain...

Brown repeatedly presses Collins to explain how NIH could not know FOR TWO YEARS that its own contractor @EcoHealthNYC had
done research making bat coronaviruses more infectious to humans, and Collins uses every rhetoric trick to dissemble and distract... I'll
explain...
Fauci claimed no "Gain of Function research was being funded in Wuhan.
Brown to Collins: “How could [Fauci] say that when you are just now finding out that US taxpayer dollars were being used to pay
for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago?" GOOD QUESTION
Collins tries to go down a rabbit hole semantic debate about the definition of gain of function (this is his usual filibuster tactic), but Brown
stops him and asks the direct question again:
Brown: “EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its contract... So the question is.. How can you know what this money is going
toward… in places the Wuhan lab if you are just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance, how the US taxpayer dollars were
being used?" EXACTLY.
Collins acknowledges EcoHealth violated its contract but then says, weirdly:
"Yes, they did some things they should have told us about, but they did not do the kind of Gain of Function research that requires
special, high level oversight." WTAF?
The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE
triggered the extra, high level oversight. Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?
https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/energy-commerce-gop-l…
There's more...
Then Collins constructs and attacks a straw man by saying: “This was in no way connected with the advent of SARS-CoV-2."
Brown points out he's refuting an assertion nobody made. She steers the interview back to the issue at hand, why didn't NIH know what
they were funding?
Brown: “There was risky research being conducted in that lab with US taxpayer dollars that NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.
So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with US taxpayer funding that you don't know about."
PRECISELY
Collins responds he doesn't think this kind of lax reporting is widespread. "This particular grantee is in trouble for not being completely
transparent about the work they were doing and we are very much following up on that.” No specifics.
Brown presses Collins (again) to acknowledge NIH has some responsibility for not knowing it was funding this research: “Isn’t this also
an oversight failure of the NIH, because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants." OF
COURSE IT IS...
This time, Collins actually blames Congress for preventing NIH from interacting with sub=grantees (the Wuhan lab), completely
sidestepping why NIH didn't ask EcoHealth (the primary grantee) for its Wuhan report FOR TWO YEARS, while a pandemic raged coming
from Wuhan...
Brown presses Collins to on the core issue:“Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of covid origins, when you didn’t
even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?" LOGICAL QUESTION
First, Collins basically makes the argument that most of the planes landed safely so nothing to see here:
“Well, that’s a little too strong, Pam... The vast majority of what they did was what we gave them permission to do.”
Then Collins makes what seems to me to be a sexist comment to Brown
“So please, relax here." (seems sexist)
"This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that could put human lives at risk.” (A bold if not
misleading assertion)
Brown stands her ground, defends her legitimate and sensible questions:
"It certainly raises questions about transparency and oversight by the NIH of where this grant money goes… Will the NIH now pull funding
from EcoHealth Alliance?"
Collins misleads again, saying the EcoHealth funding in Wuhan was cut off (true) but neglecting to mention that NIH and NIAID have
awarded EcoHealth Alliance millions more in other contracts since then for other stuff. Some accountability...
This Collins statement struck me as the most audacious:
"The last thing that needs to happen now is any sense that we are not revealing everything that we know.”
NIH is currently ignoring several Congressional requests for information and record about its work in China....
Brown ends with a simple and true statement:
“This is US taxpayer dollars going to risky research and I believe every American deserves to know about it.”
Amen.

Headline of the Webpage: "This Is Worrying Me Quite A Bit": mRNA Vaccine Inventor Shares Viral Thread Showing COVID Surge In Most-Vaxxed Countries
 Body of the Webpage:Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend; the
most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are
not.
"This is worrying me quite a bit," tweeted Malone, embedding the lengthy thread authored by Twitter user @holmenkollin (Corona Realism)
via the 'thread reader' app.

Here's what has Malone worried: 
Also take a look at what went on in the 15 most vaccinated countries

Just a few days after the start of the rollout, cases went up.

Here you go: 1600 double-jabbed british soldiers on HMS Queen Elizabeth.

Wait 2 months…
1 in 16 (= higher case rate than any country!) turns out to be
infected.https://t.co/X8EANXaTVQ

„But the vaccine also makes people less transmissible?“
That’s what some studies claimed, yes.
But at what point in time did they measure this effect?
The jabs initially trigger your immune system.
But what if the effect fades and you walk around bar any mucosal protection?
