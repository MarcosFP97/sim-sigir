Hale ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://record.umich.edu/articles/lockdowns-saved-lives-but-not-a-go-to-strategy-moving-forward/', 'Headline': 'Lockdowns saved lives, but not a go-to strategy moving forward', 'Snippet': 'A new University of Michigan-led study shows the lockdowns implemented in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic saved lives — but the decision to use lockdowns is much more nuanced and the research shouldn’t be used to justify lockdowns now or to retroactively endorse that approach, said health economist Olga Yakusheva, associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing.', 'Full_text': 'The U.S. pandemic lockdown in 2020 caused a $2.3 trillion economic downturn and split the nation politically, and now some European nations are locking down again as omicron surges through the global population.\n\nBut do these drastic measures save lives? Are they worth massive job and income losses?\n\nA new University of Michigan-led study shows the lockdowns implemented in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic saved lives — but the decision to use lockdowns is much more nuanced and the research shouldn’t be used to justify lockdowns now or to retroactively endorse that approach, said health economist Olga Yakusheva, associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing.\n\nThe study found that from March through August 2020, implementing widespread lockdowns and other mitigation in the United States potentially saved more lives (866,350 to 1,711,150) than the number of lives potentially lost (57,922 to 245,055) that were attributable to the economic downturn.\n\nHowever, the results are more ambiguous when looking at the quality-adjusted life expectancy added by lockdown (4,886,214 to 9,650,886) vs. quality-adjusted life years lost (2,093,811 to 8,858,444) due to the economic downturn.\n\nThis is because many of the people saved were high-risk older adults with multiple illnesses and fewer healthy years left to live, while those most affected by the economy were younger people in service jobs and other lower-paying occupations who found themselves without employer-provided health insurance and, in many cases, unable to pay for health care or even life-saving medications. A quality adjusted life year is one year of life in perfect health.\n\nThe study, published in PLOS One, should not be used to justify more lockdown measures, Yakusheva said. Nor is it a retroactive endorsement of the strict economic lockdown approach the United States imposed during the first six months of the pandemic.\n\n“We evaluated the full packet of public health measures as it was implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but lesser mitigation measures may have worked just as well to reduce lives lost,” Yakusheva said. “The fact is, we just will never know. At the time, we had to work with the information that we had. We knew the pandemic was deadly, and we did not have therapeutics or a vaccine.”\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since the pandemic began, and we have more tools to battle the virus, Yakusheva said. Vaccines and therapeutics are available, as are other mitigation measures.\n\nThis is the first known paper to measure the effect of pandemic lockdown mitigation measures on lives saved and lost, as opposed to typical economic evaluations, which examine the cost per life saved, she said.\n\n“This is tough for people to agree upon. Typically, people are in one of two camps — pragmatics who worry about the economy and ethicists who say any amount of money is worth saving a life,” Yakusheva said. “Some value loved ones more, or their own lives. It’s very subjective.\n\n“What we did was look at empirical correlations between loss of income and mortality, and created a range of estimates on how many people could be expected to die as a result of the downturn, which is essentially the estimated collateral damage of the public health measures. What our analysis did was to allow us an apples-to-apples comparison of lives saved vs. lives lost.”\n\nThere are important study limitations. Chief among them are that some answers to major questions were unobserved — for instance, how many lives would have been lost had COVID-19 been unmitigated. In other words, if it had just run its course with no public health measures in place.\n\n“We know how many people died with public health measures in place, but we can’t know how many people would have died without those measures in place,” Yakusheva said.\n\nThe team estimated that number based on published literature, and the accuracy of that literature, or the public’s behavior, could lead to an over or underestimate.\n\nAlso, all of the human toll of the lockdown won’t be seen immediately. For example, the health toll could manifest later as disease progression because someone who was unemployed couldn’t buy medications.\n\n“We tried to be very careful and produced a range of numbers of lives potentially saved and lost, and we hope the true numbers lie within those ranges,” Yakusheva said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06883-y', 'Headline': 'Online searches to evaluate misinformation can increase its perceived ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, we analysed the search terms for those searching online about the false/misleading article titled: “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to ...', 'Full_text': 'The theory of data voids suggests that, when individuals search online about misinformation, especially misinformation around breaking or recently published news, search engines may return little credible information, instead placing non-credible information at the top of results20. These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.acsh.org/news/2022/09/21/did-covid-lockdowns-work-16563', 'Headline': 'Did COVID Lockdowns Work? - American Council on Science and Health', 'Snippet': ""Lockdowns that were initiated early and that were strictly enforced seemed to save lives.

This makes both common and scientific sense as the closer our contact with one another, the more likely we are to transmit the virus to one another through our exhalations. Lockdowns with quarantining of infected individuals are the most effective means we have of distancing individuals. But as Mr. Berra points out, the practical application determines how much of the theoretical impact occurs.\n\nLockdowns that were initiated early and that were strictly enforced seemed to save lives. Nowhere have lockdowns been more prompt and draconian than in China. Johns Hopkins reports that China\'s cases per 100,000 are 1.6, and in the US, 318/100,000. Of course, the problem with initiating a lockdown early is that your fears may not be well founded. Early lockdowns risk “crying wolf” when the infectious threat is not as significant as initially perceived. Remember how much higher R0 was at the beginning of the pandemic, as the virus worked through the frail in our nursing homes?\n\nHuman behavior\n\n“There’s a fundamental difficulty with analyzing the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns: it is hard to know what would have happened in their absence.”\n\nFrom the viewpoint of scientific inquiry, without a control group, it is challenging to project how many lives were saved by lockdowns – although that difficulty has not kept researchers from making those estimates. The first difficulty is that lockdown meant different measures in each country. The second and more intractable problem is our human response to the pandemic and public health guidance and mandates. Those who perceived themselves as most at risk didn’t wait for government guidance; as the Florida data on cell-phone measured movement confirms, the concerned stayed home weeks before any State imperatives. Lockdowns, by that measure, have less effect.\n\nOne of the other findings was that similar lockdowns applied in different countries (a marker of cultural differences) had very different impacts. Consider Peru, which employed early and strict measures. Despite their efforts, they experience 655 deaths per 100,000 population, the highest of any country. While, in part, due to an expensive and inadequate health system, its “large informal workforce” continued to shop and work, making enforcement difficult and blunting the efficacy of lockdowns on transmission. In a country as culturally diverse as the US, local human behavior may have just as easily mitigated the effectiveness of lockdowns as the stay-at-home early adopters.\n\nThe accompanying graphic shows that the most effective lockdowns involved small and large groups.\n\n“This pandemic was crying out for [a] precision public-health response because the risks associated with the public-health threat with the virus were so focused on a small minority, and the harms done by things like lockdown were not focused on the same people.”\n\n- Mark Woolhouse, epidemiologist University of Edinburgh\n\nThis raises the fundamental issue of whether lockdowns could have been more targeted to at-risk populations. Again, early in the pandemic, it was easy to make a case to lockdown nursing homes, the frail and the elderly. Of course, that alone was insufficient because those individuals require care and caregivers. Effective isolation of the at-risk requires us to lock down their caregivers and the caregiver’s families – all chinks in the lockdown armor.\n\nA far greater debate has surrounded the lockdowns of schools. Again, early in the pandemic, there was no data on the impact of COVID on children; historically, children and the frail elderly are the most at-risk. Coupled with the very human desire to protect “our children,” it is not surprising that lockdowns included schools. While there was some evidence that older children, mid-teens and older, experienced COVID more like adults, there was a paucity of early data on the impact on younger children. Rather than a strategic lockdown of college or high school, all education was shut down. Even our late in the pandemic strategery of identifying at-risk neighborhoods was contentious – were cases, hospitalizations, or deaths the best or even accurate measure of risk?\n\n“Pure economic analyses of whether lockdowns were worth it generally try to estimate the value of lives saved and compare that with the costs of economic downturns. But there is no consensus on how to make this comparison.”\n\nLockdowns come with costs; economic, social, educational, and psychological – all difficult to quantify. When we compare those costs to the efficacy of lockdowns, when we consider the tradeoff, any number of biases influence our findings. Despite the efforts by researchers to put a value on lives lost and economic disruptions, those seemingly objective dollar values are, in fact, subjective. Economic and social costs are less weighty when we believe every life is precious. When we think that the disruption of our day-to-day lives contributes to our well-being, the balance may tip in the other direction. These are ethical, subjective choices. Using the refrain, “follow the science,” as the explanation belittles the role of science and makes public health decisions less transparent and accountable.\n\n“[the public needs to know more about how pandemic- control policies are decided]“That makes public-health policymaking seem less capricious because it’s reactive to both the science and values.”\n\n- Thomas Tsai, MD T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nThere it is, a reminder that regulatory policy, guidelines, mandates, and the acceptance and push-back they engender are human enterprises.

This is in part by design. The U.S. Constitution makes states the primary engine of public health emergency response. Yet the role of local authorities became even larger when the White House opted to leave it “up to states to figure out what they want to do.” The isolation of local decision-makers in this crisis was compounded by the persistent struggle of U.S. federal agencies to provide timely data and practical, transparent guidance to states and the public. As a result, state and local authorities were left to decide how to balance protecting health in an emergency against other societal priorities such as economic productivity, educational needs, and personal liberty.\n\nStates were the essential unit of change in this pandemic. With little political appetite to bolster federal public health authorities, states are likely to retain that central role in future U.S. public health emergencies, too. Accordingly, efforts to improve U.S. performance ahead of the next pandemic should start with examining why some states did so much better than others, even according to the various metrics governors set for themselves.\n\nThis interactive presents three ways of assessing U.S. state performance in COVID-19:\n\nMore From Our Experts\n\nHealth: a composite measure based on cumulative COVID-19 deaths and infections, adjusted for state-level differences in age and rates of diabetes, obesity, and other important health conditions that made COVID outcomes worse. Deaths are weighted as 75 percent of this composite measure.\n\nEconomy and Education: a composite measure based on changes in state gross domestic product (GDP) and employment, relative to what was expected for each pre-pandemic, and on changes in states’ fourth grade test scores between 2019 and 2022 in the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The economic measures are adjusted for the composition of economic sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, to ensure fair cross-state comparisons. GDP, employment, and test scores are equally weighted in this measure.\n\nMore on:\n\nCOVID-19\n\nPublic Health Threats and Pandemics\n\nHealth Policy and Initiatives\n\nEducation\n\nU.S. Economy\n\nAll-around: a combination of the health measure and the economy and education measure. Health is weighed more heavily (66 percent) in our measure given the priority on saving lives in a pandemic.\n\nThe data for this assessment covers the period from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2022, and is drawn from our recent peer-reviewed study published in the medical journal the Lancet. A full description of our methodology, data sources, and a few necessary simplifying assumptions can be found here.\n\nHere are a few of the lessons that can be observed from each assessment.\n\nHealth: Separate Americas\n\nThe health disparities among U.S. states in the COVID-19 pandemic were so large that to write about them is like describing the travails of different nations. For most of the pandemic, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Washington posted COVID-19 death rates comparable to those in Denmark, Germany, or Switzerland, while mortality rates from the virus in Arizona and Mississippi rival those in the world’s three worst-performing countries during that same period: Bulgaria, Peru, and Russia. Even after accounting for the relevant biological factors in this pandemic—variation in the age of state populations and in the local rates of diabetes, obesity, and other exacerbating health conditions—there is still a nearly fourfold difference between COVID-19 death rates in the best- and worst-performing U.S. states. Geographic disparities are not new to U.S. health, but the state-level differences in COVID-19 death rates are much larger than on other population-wide health measures such as average life expectancy at birth. In this pandemic, it has been as if the residents of those best- and worst-performing U.S. states reside in separate Americas.\n\nThese large interstate differences cannot be explained by politics, urbanization, and community mitigation measures alone. The leading states in this composite health measure tilt Democratic, but the Lancet study found no relationship between the political affiliation of state governors and the number of deaths that state suffered in the pandemic. The top ten in this composite measure for health are a mix of rural and urban states. Policy mandates, such as stay-at-home orders, business closures, and mask mandates, worked synergistically to reduce infections, but do not on their own explain the large state variance in COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 vaccine mandates and coverage rates, however, were strongly associated with fewer deaths and infections.\n\nNew Hampshire ranks second on our composite health measure during the pandemic, but it is middle of the pack on other population health measures (such as life expectancy). It also falls in the bottom half nationally on mandate propensity, a summary measure of a state’s overall use of COVID-19 policy mandates, such as business and school closures, mask mandates, and gathering restrictions.\n\nSo, what else mattered in the Granite state? Social, economic, and racial disparities, and the measures that the state took to address those disparities and to protect vulnerable populations, played a central role.\n\nNew Hampshire distinguished itself during the pandemic by being more aggressive in protecting vulnerable populations and in addressing its social and economic disparities. Its early vaccine allocation strategy departed from federal guidelines in prioritizing the medically vulnerable and other disproportionately affected populations, including marginalized racial and ethnic groups, the homeless, the medically homebound, and others experiencing transportation or language barriers to vaccination. The state deployed a fleet of mobile vax vans and hosted mass vaccination sites to reach more politically conservative populations, such as at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. It undertook measures to expedite access to testing and therapeutics in nursing homes and promote telehealth for rural settings, and worked with the private sector to promote more statewide sharing of essential medical supplies and load balancing at hospitals.\n\nLike some other top-performing states, New Hampshire also benefited from already low levels of social, economic, and racial disparities. It has the nation’s lowest poverty rate, high levels of average educational attainment, excellent access to quality health care, and low rates of uninsured residents. New Hampshire also reports the nation’s highest levels of interpersonal trust—the trust that people have in one another—which makes it easier to mobilize against a pandemic. New Hampshire is one of the least diverse states in the country, which matters because a key legacy of this pandemic was the degree to which individuals identifying as Black, Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Natives disproportionately suffered. Essential workers are drawn disproportionately from those groups and are more likely to live in multigenerational households, where SARS-CoV-2 spreads more easily. Long-standing and systemic discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantages in accessing health-care services, including vaccination, clearly contributed in many other states as well.\n\nFinally, the proximity of New Hampshire to early hard-hit states could have also played a role. Many top health performers were neighboring states that were all struck early in the pandemic, such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Those searing examples could have motivated citizens and policymakers in New Hampshire and other top-performing states to adopt protective behaviors and take COVID-19 seriously. A similar phenomenon occurred with nations and territories near China.\n\nThe False Trade-Off Between Health and the Economy\n\nThe dominant perception is that the pandemic presented states with a choice of protecting public health or protecting their economies and preserving in-person schooling, with Democratic governors favoring the former (lives) and Republican governors prioritizing the latter (personal freedoms and the economy). For the most part, however, this perception does not correspond with the story told by our data.\n\nNearly all states, Republican and Democratic alike, instituted protective health mandates (such as gathering restrictions, mask mandates, and closures of bars, restaurants, and gyms) during the pandemic. Most states had such mandates in place between March 2020 and June 2020. The biggest difference between the use of mandates among states occurred in November 2020 with the emergence of the Delta variant. At this point, more Democratic-leaning states than Republic-leaning states reinstituted protective health mandates. Almost no states employed protective health measures after July 2021.\n\nOverall, there is no association between these differences in states’ use of health mandates and changes in GDP or employment. The only exception is restaurant closures, which were associated with fewer jobs in our analysis.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic coincided with substantial declines in U.S. educational performance, but those learning losses were not systematically associated with state-level primary school closures. California, a state with long school closures during the pandemic, had test-score declines similar to or smaller than those in Florida and Maine, states with low rates of school closures. Those results, however, could be well different if the analysis were performed at the district or county-level.\n\nAll that said, the vast majority of states that did well on our economic and education composite measure were led by Republican governors. Only six Democrat-led states—Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin—were in the top half of states in this ranking. Those differences cannot be explained by sectoral differences in those states’ economies, such as tourism or agriculture, which were controlled for in our analysis.\n\nThe reason for those differences could be tied to population behavior and perceptions of risk differing in states along political lines. Previous analysis from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that only small a portion of the decline in economic activity during the pandemic was associated with protective policy mandates; individual choices and fear of infection played a larger role in shifting consumers away from busy in-person businesses. That result is consistent with our data, which shows that higher infection rates were associated with higher employment and better education performance. In other words, states where more people were willing to frequent in-person stores, restaurants, and schools appear to have done better on our economic and education measure. None of the states hit hard early by COVID-19 rank among the best on economic and educational performance, perhaps because that early experience shaped individual behaviors for the remainder of the pandemic. In contrast, states in which COVID-19 cases started to appear later do best on this composite measure—Alabama, Montana, and South Dakota—and the population in those states continued to exhibit high levels of mobility relative to most other U.S. states during the pandemic.\n\nAll-Around: Not All U.S. States Struggled Equally\n\nThe United States struggled in this pandemic, but not all states struggled equally. Some states managed to keep deaths and infections relatively low, even by international standards, without shutting society down or ignoring the COVID crisis. The top performers in this measure are split almost evenly between states with Democratic governors (six) and Republican governors (four). They are not confined to a single geographical region and represent a mix of urban and rural states.\n\nLike New Hampshire, Washington has relatively low levels of poverty and high levels of educational attainment, access to quality health care, and interpersonal trust. Washington deployed protective health mandates more than nearly any other state. Yet the Evergreen State economy is also host to a large and vibrant technology sector, which was better equipped than most to shift to remote work. Washington also faced challenges in this pandemic: a politically polarized population, with liberal coastal cities and conservative rural areas around the I-5 corridor; a large Native American and Alaska Native population—a group that disproportionately suffered in other states in this pandemic—and a large unhoused population in Seattle.\n\nIn interviews, Washington state health officials credit Governor Jay Inslee’s leadership and historical investments in the state public health system for more regular access to relevant data to support decision-making; an existing infrastructure for community engagement and trusted messengers, including with tribal authorities; and the human and financial resources to support rural communities and mobile vaccination campaigns. Exceptionally strong public-private partnerships enlisted leading local companies and nonprofits, such as Amazon, Starbucks, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to advise on test-kit logistics, mass-vaccination centers, and public-health data analysis. Collaboration with neighboring state authorities enabled state officials to adapt and innovate in the face of changing circumstances, including early adoption of wastewater surveillance to monitor changing disease patterns. Identification of the first U.S. cases of COVID-19 in Washington state illustrated the seriousness of the pandemic early to Governor Inslee, state officials, and the public.\n\nStates as the Essential Unit of Change in Pandemic Preparedness and Response\n\nOur assessments reveal that, whether the metric is health or the economy, the most important lessons from this pandemic were not about protective policy mandates or countermeasures, but instead what COVID-19 revealed about the communities that deployed those measures. Doing better in future health crises depends on investments to mitigate the socioeconomic and racial inequalities that led to higher death rates in this and previous pandemics. Partnering with local physicians, health centers, and faith-based institutions in divided communities can help identify trusted messengers and advance public health priorities, data collection, and two-way decision-making and communication with constituents in future crises. If the United States can learn from the best-performing states in this pandemic, perhaps other states will not struggle so much when the next health emergency happens.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02823-4', 'Headline': 'What scientists have learnt from COVID lockdowns - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Most scientists agree that lockdowns did curb COVID-19 deaths and that governments had little option but to restrict people’s social contacts in early 2020, to stem SARS-CoV-2’s spread and ...', 'Full_text': 'In March 2021, a doctor in Brazil named Ricardo Savaris published a now-discredited research paper that went viral on social media1.\n\nIt had been a year since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to apply the desperate measures collectively known as lockdowns — cancelling sporting and cultural events, closing retail outlets, restaurants, schools and universities, and ordering people to stay at home. At the time, countries were once again dialling lockdown policies up or down, as the Alpha variant of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 surged in different places.\n\nLockdown measures did what they were supposed to. When they were enforced rigorously enough to reduce people’s social contacts sharply, they shrank COVID-19 outbreaks; several studies had demonstrated this.\n\nBut Savaris, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, tried a fresh analysis together with three colleagues (who worked in statistics, computer science and informatics). They compared 87 locations around the world, in pairs, to see whether a lower rate of COVID-19 deaths correlated with greater time spent at home, assessed using anonymized cellphone data released by Google. In most cases, their paper in Scientific Reports concluded, it didn’t.\n\nThe paper was highlighted by prominent lockdown sceptics and some news sites and swiftly gained notoriety. “The findings were quite remarkable, on the face of it,” says Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist at the University of Wollongong, Australia. As he and others would show, the results were wrong, because of errors in the paper’s choice of statistical methods.\n\nWithin a week, Scientific Reports added an ‘editor’s note’ to the paper, alerting readers to criticisms. Nine months later, the journal published two letters2,3 that laid out the paper’s errors. A week after that, it retracted the work, although neither Savaris nor his co-authors agreed with the retraction. (Scientific Reports is published by Springer Nature; Nature’s reporting is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nThe retracted paper is not the only one to contend that lockdowns failed to save lives. But these analyses are out of step with the majority of studies. Most scientists agree that lockdowns did curb COVID-19 deaths and that governments had little option but to restrict people’s social contacts in early 2020, to stem SARS-CoV-2’s spread and avert the collapse of health-care systems. “We needed to buy ourselves some time,” says Lauren Meyers, a biological data scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe pandemic’s true health cost: how much of our lives has COVID stolen?\n\nAt the same time, it’s clear that lockdowns had huge costs, and there is debate about the utility of any subsequent lockdown measures. School and university closures disrupted education. Closing businesses contributed to financial and social hardship, mental ill health and economic downturns. “There’s costs and benefits,” says Samir Bhatt, a public-health statistician at Imperial College London and the University of Copenhagen.\n\nScientists have been studying the effects of lockdowns during the pandemic in the hope that their findings could inform the response to future crises. They have reached some conclusions: countries that acted quickly to bring in stringent measures did best at preserving both lives and their economies, for instance. But researchers have also encountered difficulties. Analysing competing harms and benefits often comes down not to scientific calculations, but to value judgements, such as how to weigh costs that fall on some sections of society more than others. That is what makes lockdowns so hard to study — and can lead to bitter disagreement.\n\nTricky calculation\n\nThere’s a fundamental difficulty with analysing the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns: it is hard to know what would have happened in their absence.\n\nLockdowns do reduce viral transmission, as the shutdown of Wuhan, China, showed when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. Even in countries that didn’t emulate China’s all-in approach of closing borders, ordering citizens to stay at home and isolating people with COVID in central facilities, lockdown measures still cut disease spread. In May 2020, for instance, Bhatt and others analysed lockdowns in 11 European countries and extrapolated from the fall in viral transmission that these measures alone had saved more than 3 million lives4.\n\nThat paper’s methodology has also been questioned, however. One issue is that it could have overstated the size of the benefit because it assumes that without lockdown mandates, people wouldn’t have reduced their social contacts. In reality, rising deaths would probably have changed people’s behaviour.\n\nThat happened in Florida, for instance, where data show a reduction in mobility during the first wave about two weeks before lockdowns, says health-policy researcher Thomas Tsai at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. “People were watching the news in New York and Boston and seeing how severe COVID could be,” he says.\n\nOne analysis5 by political scientist Christopher Berry and his colleagues at the University of Chicago, Illinois, supports this. It suggests that US states’ shelter-in-place orders did little to further reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths, not because social distancing doesn’t work, but because people were already avoiding contact before the orders were imposed.\n\nOther researchers have tried instead to compare whether countries with stricter lockdown policies performed better than those with more relaxed ones on measures such as disease transmission rates or deaths. This isn’t simple, either: enforcement, levels of government aid and compliance with official policies differed from one region to another — as did cultural context and a host of other factors, including population densities, levels of social contact and viral prevalence.\n\nTake Sweden, for instance, which imposed relatively light restrictions in early 2020, keeping schools open for all but the oldest students. It experienced a lower rate of excess deaths in 2020 than did many other western European nations. But it is also a country where many people live alone (the average household size in Sweden is the lowest in the European Union), and where people have high trust in government, making it much easier for official recommendations alone — rather than mandates — to reduce social contacts and slow disease spread. Far from carrying on life as normal, Swedes reduced their mobility, as shown by mobile-phone data. Even so, its Nordic neighbours that imposed lockdowns performed better in 2020: age-standardized mortality rates show that Denmark, Finland and Norway experienced fewer deaths than normal that year, whereas Sweden experienced slightly more than usual. (As in other countries, Sweden also failed to prevent the most vulnerable people, such as those in elder-care homes, from dying of COVID-19.)\n\n“It wasn’t really clear what is the best way of estimating the effectiveness of [lockdown] measures,” says Peter Klimek, a data scientist at the Medical University of Vienna. Still, by tracking the stringency and timing of government policies in more than 100 countries, researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, and their colleagues did find6 that the more stringent a nation’s containment policies, the more successful it was at averting deaths from COVID-19.\n\nIt is even harder to tease out subtler insights, such as which of the grab bag of lockdown policies — from closing schools to ordering people to stay at home — had the most effect, especially because policies were often announced in quick succession.\n\nAfter the first wave of COVID-19, Klimek’s team analysed thousands of government interventions. The group noted that some measures seemed effective according to one modelling approach, but not according to others, and that their effectiveness estimates came with wide uncertainty ranges. But the researchers were able to produce an overall ranking (see ‘How effective were COVID-19 interventions?’). The most effective measures were policies banning small gatherings and closing businesses and schools, closely followed by land-border restrictions and national lockdowns. Less-intrusive measures — such as government support for vulnerable populations, and risk-communication strategies — also had an impact. Airport health checks, however, had no discernible benefit7.\n\nOther studies have tried to put more precise figures on the effects of lockdown policies, but their findings differ. An analysis8 of 41 countries in Europe and elsewhere found that stay-at-home orders had a relatively small impact on transmission, reducing R — the average number of people that one person with COVID-19 will go on to infect — by just 13% beyond what could be achieved by closing schools and universities (38%) or limiting gatherings to 10 people or fewer (42%). Yet Bhatt’s analysis4 of 11 countries suggested that stay-at-home orders cut R by 81%, with school closures, public-event bans and other measures being less important. Klimek warns against generalizing about the effectiveness of lockdown policies on the basis of figures such as these. “The effectiveness of each intervention is highly context dependent,” he says. What several analyses suggest is that no single intervention can reduce R to below 1 (signifying that infections are declining): multiple measures achieve this by working in concert.\n\nGo hard, go fast\n\nThe pre-vaccine period of the pandemic does show that countries that acted harshly and swiftly — the ‘go hard, go fast’ approach — often fared better than those that waited to implement lockdown policies. China’s harsh lockdowns eliminated COVID-19 locally, for a time. Successful countries that learnt from this were “proactive”, according to a May 2021 report9 by the Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness & Response, established by the World Health Organization in September 2020 to review the global response. Examples include island nations such as Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, which also benefited from being able to close their borders and take action before many people with the virus arrived.\n\nOthers have echoed this. Epidemiologist Edward Knock and other members of the Imperial College COVID-19 response team concluded that nationwide lockdown was the only measure that consistently took R below 1 in England. And the earlier that strict measures were imposed, the better. Knock estimated that had England introduced a nationwide lockdown one week earlier in March 2020, it would have halved deaths during the first wave10. A study11 of government responses in Asia also suggested that a ‘go hard, go fast’ approach was best.\n\nBut harsher lockdowns aren’t always more effective by themselves, especially in countries where it is difficult for people to stay at home. Peru is an example. It imposed early and strict lockdown measures, but experienced an excess death rate much higher than did other countries in the region that used less draconian measures. Peru is still held up as evidence that lockdowns don’t work — but in fact it struggled to enforce them. The country has a large informal workforce, combined with expensive and inadequate health infrastructure. Despite lockdowns, many Peruvians continued to venture out to shop and to work, and so transmission remained stubbornly high, says Camila Gianella Malca, a public-policy researcher at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.\n\nSecond wave\n\nThe impacts of lockdowns also differed from one pandemic wave to the next. By the time second waves emerged, so much had been learnt about the virus that people’s behaviour was quite different. By October 2020, population-wide masking policies had become common. Schools and other settings established physical-distancing measures to keep people apart, and people took more precautions when local transmission increased. Hospitals also learnt quickly how best to treat COVID-19: death rates after the first wave decreased by 20% owing to improved treatment alone.\n\nTogether, these changes dampened the extent to which countries benefited from lockdowns. For example, several studies found that school closures during the first wave reduced the spread of COVID-19. Yet Bhatt’s analysis12 suggests that second-wave school closures had a much smaller effect. “We were surprised by that, to be honest,” he says.\n\nOnly a handful of countries continued to take a ’go hard, go fast’ approach after the first wave. Countries that had aimed for elimination — China, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam, for example — saw that it worked and then went harder and faster, according to research by Anna Petherick, a public-policy researcher at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government and her colleagues, who tracked government policies in more than 180 countries13. But in countries where belated first-wave lockdowns had merely lessened transmission, governments became less likely to take early action, tolerating higher case numbers in subsequent waves before ordering lockdowns (see ‘Thresholds for lockdown’).\n\nBlunt tool?\n\nSome researchers argue that countries could have avoided blunt all-of-society lockdowns, especially after the measures taken early in 2020. Among them is Mark Woolhouse, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, who advised the Scottish government during the pandemic. He argues that it might have been possible to avoid the closing of schools and cooping-up of younger people — who were at lower risk of COVID-19 — while focusing efforts on protecting vulnerable and older people as soon as high-risk individuals and settings were identified. “This pandemic was crying out for [a] precision public-health response, because the risks associated with the public-health threat with the virus were so focused on a small minority, and the harms done by things like lockdown were not focused on the same people,” he says.\n\nBut many researchers have pushed back against the idea that a more targeted approach was ever possible. Klimek says that roughly one-third of the population in wealthy nations was vulnerable because of underlying health conditions, so targeted measures would have been difficult to implement. And the virus has caused not only deaths but also post-infection illnesses such as long COVID — which has emerged as a health burden even for people who had mild disease.\n\nAnother targeted option for governments considering how to reopen societies might have been to keep only high-risk locations closed — restaurants and bars, say, or even neighbourhoods with high population mobility, says Serina Chang at Stanford University in California, who worked with colleagues to identify such places using cellphone data14. But shutting down neighbourhoods would probably disproportionately affect socially disadvantaged communities. “Fairness is such an important question here,” she says.\n\nBenefits versus harms\n\nWoolhouse says there was scant effort to debate the scale of potential harms caused by lockdowns, meaning that policymakers were unable to weigh up costs and benefits properly. Indeed, early on, many countries adopted a ‘save lives at any cost’ approach, he says.\n\nAnd lockdown policies did bring costs. Although they delayed outbreaks, saving lives by allowing countries to hang on for vaccines and drugs, they also brought significant social isolation and associated mental-health problems, rising rates of domestic violence and violence against women, cancelled medical appointments and disruption to education for children and university students. And they were often (although not always) accompanied by economic downturns.\n\nBut the common refrain that lockdowns involved a choice — saving lives versus livelihoods, or lives versus the economy — is a false dichotomy, says Stuart McDonald, an actuary and founder of the UK-based COVID-19 Actuaries Response Group, a community of specialists who have carried out regular analyses of mortality during the pandemic. If the UK government had not imposed belated lockdowns in 2020, hospital systems would have been overrun, death rates for all kinds of illnesses would have rocketed and economies and livelihoods would have collapsed anyway, he says. One analysis15 up to November 2021 estimated that the United States lost US$65.3 billion a month during lockdowns. But another16 estimated that US lockdowns from early March until the end of July 2020 added between $632.5 billion and $765 billion to the economy, compared with the alternative of no lockdowns. Unsurprisingly, the countries that did best in terms of saving lives and protecting the economy were those that acted fast with strict lockdowns.\n\nThe pandemic derailed learning for 1.6 billion students. Here’s how to help them catch up\n\nWhat is more, some governments did at least try to consider various harms, McDonald says. In July 2020, for instance, McDonald attended a meeting of the UK government’s COVID-19 advisory group to discuss efforts to model the direct and indirect health impacts of lockdowns, measured by the preservation or loss of quality-adjusted life years — QALYs. (This measure gives more weight to younger lives than the lives of older people, who are judged to have lost fewer QALYs if they die.) Fewer deaths from road accidents were tallied as a benefit of lockdown, for instance; QALYs lost owing to delayed cancer diagnoses, or poorer health owing to loss of income, were harms. In August 2020, the report discussed at the meeting was publicly released17: it argued that QALYs lost would have been three times higher had there been no mitigation measures, such as lockdowns, in place. (McDonald was not involved in writing it, but contributed to subsequent versions of the report.)\n\nNot all harms can be accounted for in this way. Loss of education because of school closures might indirectly harm children in the long run, potentially decreasing their future earnings and placing them at greater risk of poorer health outcomes. McDonald says that such harms are so far off — decades, in some cases — that they can’t readily be factored into a QALY ledger.\n\nValue judgements\n\nPure economic analyses of whether lockdowns were worth it generally try to estimate the value of lives saved and compare that with the costs of economic downturns. But there is no consensus on how to make this comparison. Tweaks to the value placed on human life in these analyses can alter conclusions about whether lockdowns were worth it, found Lisa Robinson, a public-policy analyst at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues18. If older lives are assigned a lower monetary value than younger ones, for instance, then — because COVID-19 disproportionately affected older people — lockdowns might be judged to have provided less benefit than if all lives are valued equally.\n\nJonathan Aldred, an economist at the University of Cambridge, UK, says that cost–benefit calculations of this kind are ill-suited to decision-making during an emergency, given the numerous sources of uncertainty. Putting monetary values on everything — from lives lost to the economic hit caused by shop closures — can give the impression that decisions about lockdowns are objective. But, says Aldred, the upshot is that “you’re hiding the fact that there are ethical judgements that have been made”. Policymakers should instead have a transparent discussion about the ethics of weighing costs and benefits, says Aldred, rather than suggest there is a ‘scientific’ answer. Without this kind of reckoning, we could be “back to square one” in a future pandemic, he says, with the same contentious debates about whether to close schools and at what harm to other sections of society.\n\nThe next pandemic\n\nNow that COVID-19 vaccines and treatments for severe disease are widely available, most countries that have taken full advantage of them are unlikely to return to lockdowns. So what have researchers learnt that can inform decisions when another viral pandemic arrives?\n\nOne lesson that Klimek takes from lockdown studies is that there was an early window of opportunity when the virus could have been eliminated — as it was, in effect, in countries such as China, Australia and New Zealand. Had harsher measures been adopted sooner, and more widely, the pandemic might have played out very differently. “I think this is the big learning that we need to take away,” he says.\n\nThe paradox is that a successful early clampdown, or hard and fast action against a virus that turns out to be milder than initial indications suggest, could lead to complaints of overreaction.\n\nA future threat might, of course, also spread in a completely different way from COVID-19. Ethical choices could look very different if the next pandemic is caused by an influenza virus that predominantly affects and is spread by young children.\n\nLockdowns hold another clear lesson: they exacerbate inequalities that already exist in society. Those already living in poverty and insecurity are hit hardest. Guarding against these unequal impacts requires improved health access and financial safeguards when times are good.\n\nAnd transparency is key, too: the public needs to know more about how pandemic-control policies are decided, says Tsai. “That makes public-health policymaking seem less capricious,” he says, “because it’s reactive to both the science and values.”'}}",100.0,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party.

While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers.

But his report fell short of bringing a flurry of criminal convictions, which had been predicted to follow the probe of what Trump called ""the crime of the century"" within U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe investigation led to one conviction and two trials, both of which resulted in acquitals. A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty to altering an email from the CIA that was used as evidence when investigators sought court permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nWhat did the more-than-300-page Durham report conclude after investigators conducted more than 480 interviews, served more than 190 subpoenas and reviewed more than 1 million documents? Here’s what we know.\n\nWho is Durham and what was he investigating?\n\nDurham was a special counsel appointed to investigate the FBI’s and Justice Department’s probes into the Trump campaign.\n\nIn 2019, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, assigned Durham to investigate whether the FBI or other government agencies violated the law when looking into possible links between then-presidential candidate Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as a special counsel on the investigation, but Barr kept that appointment secret until December 2020 to avoid interfering with the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA special counsel is a semi-independent attorney tapped to investigate and potentially prosecute a case when it presents a possible conflict of interest for the Justice Department, or ""where it’s deemed to be in the public interest to have someone outside the government come in and take responsibility for a matter,"" The Associated Press reported.\n\nDurham was set to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Trump campaign investigation, which began in summer 2016, and the investigation by special counsel Robert. S. Mueller that began in 2017.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham, the prosecutor appointed to investigate potential government wrongdoing in the early days of the Trump-Russia probe, leaves federal court in Washington, May 16, 2022. (AP)\n\nDid the Durham report determine that the FBI should have never opened an investigation at all?\n\nDurham’s report suggested that the FBI moved too quickly to open a full investigation, but stopped short of denouncing the FBI’s and Justice Department’s decisions to investigate.\n\nDurham wrote, ""There is no question that the FBI had an affirmative obligation to closely examine"" intelligence provided by the Australian government, which said its diplomats had heard George Papadopoulos, a Trump adviser, make alarming statements related to Russia. Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for lying about his attempts to allegedly connect other Trump campaign staff with officials representing Russia. He was pardoned by Trump near the end of Trump’s presidency.\n\nDurham wrote that it would have been a ""sensible step"" for the FBI to have opened a more narrowly focused preliminary investigation based on that intelligence — which Durham wrote was ""essentially the sole basis cited by the FBI for opening a full investigation.""\n\nPreliminary investigations, he wrote, are constrained by time limits and fewer approved investigation techniques.\n\nDurham’s report also recommended the FBI take additional steps to reform its investigation process. He proposed making an FBI official responsible for challenging the steps taken in politically sensitive investigations.\n\nResponding to the report, the FBI said the conduct Durham examined was the reason agency leadership implemented corrective actions some time ago, although that time period isn’t specifically defined. If such reforms had been in place in 2016, the agency said, the missteps Durham identified could have been prevented.\n\nDid the Durham report vindicate Trump’s claims that the investigation into his campaign was a baseless ""witch hunt""?\n\nDurham\'s report found that the investigation into Trump\'s campaign was triggered by uncorroborated intelligence that should have been scrutinized more intensely before a full investigation was launched.\n\nBut the report did not conclude that the investigation was entirely baseless and illegitimate.\n\nTrump has long referred to the investigation into potential collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia as a ""witch hunt"" conducted without evidence. The former president has also often claimed that the collusion allegations were a ""hoax.""\n\nDurham’s report supports the underlying elements of Trump’s sometimes-exaggerated claims. Durham concluded that the FBI moved too quickly to open an investigation based on ""raw, unanalyzed, uncorroborated intelligence."" Durham also wrote that the agency had relied significantly on investigative leads provided or funded by Trump’s political opponents — without adequately questioning the motivations of the people providing the information.\n\nDurham emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny and analysis.\n\nWhen the FBI’s initial investigation was opened, ""neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings,"" Durham wrote.\n\nThe report concluded that senior FBI officials ""displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor"" toward the information received. Additionally, Durham wrote that ""apparent confirmation bias"" and ""an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents"" resulted in investigators acting ""without appropriate objectivity or restraint"" when investigating the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham’s report emphasized the role of confirmation bias in the investigation, rather than political bias. This meant that as the FBI investigated the Trump campaign, the agency ""discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support"" the collusion narrative, Durham wrote.\n\nThe report did, however, outline how the FBI’s response to allegations about the Trump campaign differed from the agency’s response to similar allegations about the Clinton campaign, including:\n\nThe FBI’s decision not to open an inquiry or have analytical personnel investigate ""intelligence it received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin"" to divert attention from her own use of a private email server.\n\nProviding defensive briefings for Clinton and her staff when, during her 2016 presidential campaign, it had gathered evidence that foreign operatives were working to gain influence with her campaign. No defensive briefings were provided to the Trump campaign based on the Australian diplomat’s intelligence.\n\nDurham’s report is not the first criticism of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A 2019 report by the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the FBI for ""serious performance failures"" during the investigation. Still, that report concluded that the agency acted without political bias and was justified in opening its investigation.\n\nDid the report clear Trump of ‘all wrongdoing’?\n\nDurham wasn’t tasked with clearing Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nDurham was asked to determine whether the FBI or others violated the law while investigating the Trump campaign.\n\nAfter the report was released, Trump’s allies and supporters claimed on social media that it exonerated Trump and cleared him of ""ALL wrongdoing."" But that wasn’t the purpose of Durham’s investigation. He was investigating the investigators, not Trump’s conduct.\n\nMueller’s investigation, not Durham’s, culminated in a 2019 report that cleared the Trump campaign of allegations that it conspired with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf or the numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia amounted to criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.\n\nMueller’s report detailed numerous occasions on which Trump tried to impede that investigation, but Mueller ultimately declined to say whether Trump’s actions obstructed justice.

On the stand, he tried to dismiss the significance of his inflated statements of net worth, which are at the heart of the case.', 'Full_text': 'Courtroom 300 at the New York County Courthouse was quiet on Monday following Donald Trump’s last-minute decision not to testify again in his civil trial on charges of business fraud. The proceeding, which began in early October, is now approaching an end. Trump’s lawyers are wrapping up the defense’s case. They had been scheduled to call him as their final witness—one of them had said last week that he wanted to testify—but, on Sunday, Trump announced on his social-media site that he wouldn’t be showing up. “I have already testified to everything & have nothing more to say other than this is a complete & total election interference (Biden campaign!) witch hunt,” he wrote.\n\nOf course, the Biden Administration has nothing to do with this case, which is being brought by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James. Last month, James’s lawyers called Trump as a witness for the prosecution. On the stand, he tried to dismiss the significance of his inflated statements of net worth, which are at the heart of the case. If he had testified again on Monday, it would have given him another chance to defend himself and take some more potshots at James and Judge Arthur F. Engoron, who is presiding over a bench case with no jury. But it would also have given the prosecutors a second crack at him, on cross-examination.\n\nEvidently, Trump’s lawyers persuaded their client to bow out—and for good reason. As Lisa Rubin, a legal analyst for MSNBC, pointed out in a blog post on Monday, Trump “has never been a reliable or helpful witness in his own defense.” I was at the courthouse for his testimony last month, and, although his lawyers publicly praised his combative performance, it didn’t help their legal case. Trump admitted that he went over some of the figures in his company’s statements of net worth with Allen Weisselberg, the then chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and suggested adjustments to some of them. He also conceded that some of the documents for the Trump Organization’s loans from Deutsche Bank required the company to maintain accurate financial statements. And he gave a misleading account of the laughable efforts to inflate the value of his triplex at Trump Tower.\n\nTrump’s tendency to gab meant that minimizing his time on the witness stand was a no-brainer. It’s a strategy that his lawyers are likely to mimic when the four criminal cases against him go to trial. Two of these cases—one involving a federal indictment in Washington, D.C., another at the state level in Fulton County, Georgia—arose from Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. There is another federal case, in Florida, which involves charges that he mishandled classified information and attempted to obstruct justice. In the fourth case, brought by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, Trump faces criminal charges of falsifying business records arising from the surreptitious payoff he made in 2016 to the adult-film star Stormy Daniels. Given the potential ramifications of these cases, which include Trump being found guilty and sentenced to prison, the New York civil case has always been something of an afterthought. But even though this case is largely about money—the prosecutors are asking the court to ban Trump and his sons from doing business in New York and to issue a fine of up to two hundred and fifty million dollars—it has certainly got under Trump’s skin and provided some suggestions of how the criminal trials are likely to play out.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have followed a strategy that involves a division of labor. In the courtroom, the Trump team, led by Chris Kise, a former Florida solicitor general, has had the resources and wherewithal to launch a lengthy and expansive legal defense. Simultaneously, and mostly from outside the courtroom, Trump has mounted a sustained campaign of vilification against the prosecutors, the courts, the Biden Administration, and the very idea that he should be held accountable for anything.\n\nConfronted with a mountain of documentary evidence relating to the bogus statements of net worth, Trump’s lawyers have largely avoided that incriminating record and sought to undermine the legal basis of the attorney general’s case. To this end, they have called on a number of expert witnesses. Last Thursday, Eli Bartov, a professor of accounting at N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business, told the court, “I’ve never seen a statement that provides so much detail and is so transparent as these statements.” On Friday, Bartov revealed that he had been paid nearly nine hundred thousand dollars for testifying, with some of the money coming from the Trump Organization and the rest from Trump’s Save America PAC. With MAGA campaign donors footing the bill, Trump can apparently afford the best testimony money can buy.\n\nThe Trump lawyers have also appealed some of Engoron’s rulings, including one in which he ruled, pretrial, that in preparing the bogus financial statements and submitting them to various financial institutions, Trump and the Trump Organization violated a New York fraud statute. (The case is now largely about putative penalties and efforts by the Trump lawyers to create grounds for an appeal.) More recently, Kise and his colleagues have asked a higher court to overturn a gag order that Engoron issued, which prohibited Trump from publicly commenting on the court staff, including one of the judge’s law clerks, whom Trump had attacked personally in a social-media post.\n\nEven though these appeals haven’t succeeded, Trump’s lawyers in the criminal cases are already following the same strategy of appealing virtually everything, including the Justice Department’s authority to press charges against him relating to his conduct in office. This is partly a delay tactic—Trump would dearly love to push back the criminal trials until after the 2024 election, a fact the prosecutors are well aware of. In what looked like an effort to expedite the appeals process, the special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the federal elections charges against Trump, asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether the former President has immunity from prosecution, and the high court agreed to fast-track its consideration of whether to hear the case.\n\nSmith’s move and the Supreme Court’s response are potentially a blow to the Trump team’s efforts to push the Washington trial back from its scheduled start date in March. Even if they lose that one, though, Trump’s lawyers will doubtless continue with their efforts to facilitate his attacks on the prosecutors and the courts. On Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled on a request from Trump’s lawyers to overturn a gag order issued by Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the federal elections case. The appeals court left in place those parts of the ruling in which Chutkan ordered Trump not to make public comments on any member of the court staff or anyone working with Smith, but the appeals court struck down another important element of Chutkan’s ruling, which prohibited Trump from attacking Smith himself.\n\nAs the trial date approaches, Trump will doubtless take advantage of Friday’s ruling, which the D.C. appeals court described as an effort to balance his right to free speech with the need to protect the integrity of the legal system. In all probability, he will now step up his attacks on Smith, whom he has already described as “deranged,” “a thug,” and a “fully weaponized monster.” (If Trump sees the irony of a system that he is vilifying going out of its way to make sure his constitutional rights are protected, he hasn’t acknowledged it.) But one thing Trump seems unlikely to do, at any stage, is step back into a witness-box, where Smith’s team could confront him with detailed evidence of his efforts to overturn the election, and, quite likely, elicit some self-incriminating statements. Trump is sometimes his own worst enemy, and his lawyers know it. ♦'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/incriminating-trump-ny-fraud-trial-175044552.html', 'Headline': '""Incriminating"": Trump NY fraud trial defense witness backfires - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'In her $250 million lawsuit, New York Attorney General Letitia James has accused McConney of aiding the Trump family and former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg in doctoring business paperwork to secure better deals with banks and insurance companies.', 'Full_text': 'Ex-Trump Organization accountant Jeffrey McConney broke down in tears on the witness stand Tuesday as Donald Trump\'s civil fraud trial in New York pressed on into its eighth week.

Court records from previous court cases show that he played a key role in Trump\'s scheme to direct charitable funds to then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a plot that eventually ended with the New York attorney general shutting the charity down.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\'s trial last year revealed how McConney also helped executives evade taxes, with him admitting that he ""tried to help them in any way I could… with some suggestions.” The company was convicted of all charges and fined $1.6 million.\n\nIn that case, McConney attempted to shoulder all the blame and attribute it to personal ""mistakes."" A juror later told The Daily Beast that the jury grew tired of him after realizing ""he was stonewalling the prosecution and just could not say enough for the defense.”\n\nHe employed the same tactic last month when lawyers with the attorney general questioned him about his role in the alleged fraud scheme, which involved nearly a dozen real estate projects over the course of 10 years.\n\nThe retiree had an easier time on the witness stand Monday and Tuesday as he fielded questions from the defense.\n\nBut the story of his departure from the Trump Organization failed to include the crucial fact that he was promised a $500,000 severance package when leaving the company. When state investigators questioned him in court early last month, McConney revealed that he had already received $375,000 of the sum and was still owed $125,000.\n\n""That monetary arrangement raises obvious red flags, given the concern that his former employer may still have considerable influence over a witness in the case,"" The Daily Beast\'s Jose Pagliery reported.\n\nThe situation mirrors the agreement McConney\'s former supervisor, Weisselberg, made ahead of his testimony in the district attorney\'s criminal trial last year. He revealed when he testified that he was actually still earning the same $640,000 annual salary and receiving the same $500,000 yearly bonus, including a payout that he admitted he was looking forward to receiving shortly after that trial. Former prosecutors who spoke to The Daily Beast at the time decried it as a blatant method of keeping Trump\'s trusted workers in check.\n\nMcConney quickly regained his composure on Tuesday and then took questions from Andrew Amer, special litigation counsel for the attorney general. He also quickly resumed his strategy of claiming ignorance when asked about holes in his testimony.\n\nOn Monday, the former Trump employee said that external-hired accountants at the firm Mazars USA wrote a particular paragraph in Trump\'s 2015 statement of financial condition that was littered with caveats. The assertion supported the defense\'s attempt to cast away blame by creating distance between Trump and certain details in his vastly inflated financial statements.\n\nDuring cross-examination on Tuesday, however, Amer displayed an image in the courtroom and pointed out that McConney had written the very same paragraph in blue pen on a handwritten note that lauded Trump\'s ""brand value"" and how it ""afforded Mr. Trump the opportunity to participate in licensing deals around the globe as reflected on the balance sheet herein.”\n\nUpon being questioned about it, McConney claimed he didn\'t remember who wrote it.\n\nMcConney\'s testimony went on to prove injurious to himself, Trump, the former president\'s eldest sons and Weisselberg as he was questioned about the blue-ink notes written on the sides of several net-worth statement drafts presented by prosecutors, Business Insider reports.\n\nAnother cautionary note from the 2015 draft showed McConney wrote that ""this computation also includes forecasted deals that have not signed yet"" and asked whether Trump wanted to exclude $151 million in as-yet-fictional assets from the statement.\n\nThe final version of that year\'s net-worth statement indicates that McConney\'s suggestion went ignored, possibly by Trump himself. In the civil case, the attorney general alleges that Trump fluffed up his net-worth statements with those sorts of nonexistent assets.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nDuring Tuesday\'s cross, McConney was also handed a draft of Trump\'s 2014 statement and was asked to look at a note on the draft\'s first page — ""DJT TO GET FINAL REVIEW"" — which he said he had written.\n\nThe former president has repeatedly denied involvement in preparing the decade\'s worth of financial statements and, in a pretrial deposition denied knowing who had written the note on the draft. The attorney general had alleged that the 2014 net-worth statement contained $3.5 billion in exaggerations.\n\n""Donald Trump would get final review?"" Amer asked the retired accountant.\n\n""That was my understanding, yes,"" McConney answered from the stand.\n\nAmer asked next whether Trump would get the final review of every statement until leaving for the Oval Office in 2017, after which Eric Trump would approve the drafts.\n\n""That was my understanding, yes,"" McConney answered again. When asked if it was his handwriting on the drafts — the blue pen marks — McConney also confirmed that it was.\n\nMcConney\'s slew of handwritten notes indicate that it was Trump and his top executives who made the final changes and signed off on these net-worth statements. As such, those notes deal a serious blow to the Trump team\'s primary defense of blaming the external accountants.\n\nThe attorney general\'s office also seems prepared to argue that these handwritten notes show McConney, Weisselberg and Trump intentionally plotted in doctoring the numbers each year.\n\nWhile presiding Judge Arthur Engoron has already found before the trial that Trump and the other defendants committed fraud in inflating his wealth on the statements, the trial is to determine whether they further violated six specific state laws: falsifying business records, filing false financial statements, insurance fraud, and conspiracy to commit each of these counts — all of which require proof of intention.\n\nMcConney\'s notes could also come back to bite the Trumps and their company by the end of the trial.\n\n""The fact that these incriminating, hand-scrawled drafts were turned over to authorities by Mazars but not by the Trump Organization could come up at the end of the trial as evidence that Trump\'s side failed to retain and turn over documents as required by state subpoenas,"" Business Insider\'s Laura Italiano reported.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-fraud-trial-live-updates-rcna122520', 'Headline': 'Trump fraud trial recap: Former president testifies in N.Y. legal case', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump testified today in the $250 million civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

""The fraud was on behalf of the court. The court was the fraudster in this case.""\n\nThe former president went on to highlight a recent New York Times / Siena survey that showed him ahead of President Joe Biden in several battleground states. The poll numbers were also referred to in court today by Trump\'s attorney.\n\n""When you look at the numbers, the poll numbers that came out today ... people are sick and tired of what\'s happening,"" Trump said when he left the courtroom.\n\nJames says Trump \'engaged in distractions\' in court today\n\nLeaving the courtroom today, James characterized Trump\'s testimony as a series of ""distractions"" and ""insults.""\n\n""Today we heard from Donald Trump,"" James said.

""We have a very hostile judge. I don’t have a jury. I wanted a jury.""\n\nThe mood in court has changed\n\nWhile the post-break mood in court is more relaxed, and Trump seems to be answering questions somewhat concisely, there have been some testy moments.\n\nAt one point, Trump cut the attorney general\'s lawyer off, telling him ""no"" and continuing to speak as the lawyer tried to ask a question.\n\nAt another point, when Trump continued to assert that his net worth was greater than what was on financial statements and thus the state didn\'t have a case, he again mentioned a disclaimer clause the company put on its financial statements, saying it ""goes on forever.""\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” AG\'s office lawyer Kevin Wallace replied, apparently referring to Trump\'s previously discursive answers to his questions.\n\nTrump is calmer after the break\n\nTrump appears more measured and steady in answering the attorney general lawyer\'s questions — in sharp contrast to his testimony before lunch, when he was fired up.\n\nAG James mocks Trump\'s testimony\n\nand\n\nLetitia James, who\'s in attendance in court today, took to the social media platform X to deride one of Trump\'s claims about her on the witness stand.\n\nTrump testified that the value of his property at 40 Wall Street ""is hundreds of millions of dollars more than what she says. She doesn’t even know what 40 Wall Street is.""\n\nJames laughed at the remark in court, and then posted a message with a shushing emoji that said, ""Don’t tell, I can see it from my office window.""\n\nThe court has returned from the lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court is back in session after a lunch break. The judge returned to the courtroom at about 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump is now back on the stand to resume his testimony.\n\nSketch: Trump on the stand\n\nA courtroom sketch artist\'s rendering of Trump testifying at his civil fraud trial today.\n\nTrump\'s lawyer calls Engoron \'unhinged\'\n\nAlina Habba, one of Trump\'s attorneys, told reporters during the lunch break that Engoron is ""unhinged"" and had ""predetermined"" that Trump was guilty.\n\n""I don\'t want to hear what he has to say,"" Habba said, quoting the judge\'s admonishment to Trump\'s lawyers this morning after Engoron asked Trump to give more succinct answers during his testimony.\n\n""That was what rang true loud and could not have been more honest, coming from the judge who was already predetermined that my client committed fraud before we even walked into this courtroom,"" Habba said.\n\nWhen he made the remark, Engoron had been trying to rein in Trump’s answers, telling his team that the former president was not there to talk about things outside the attorney general’s lawyer’s line of questioning.\n\nHabba went on to say that the country is ""falling apart"" and there is ""corruption in courtrooms where attorneys are gagged.""\n\n""You have a right to hire a lawyer who can stand up and say something when they see something wrong. But I was told to sit down today, I was yelled at,"" Habba said.\n\nHabba also criticized James, saying that she was using the trial to ""make a name for herself.""\n\n""[James] said this morning that the numbers don\'t lie and they won\'t lie in this case. Well, Miss James, I have a message for you: The numbers didn\'t lie when you ran for governor, and that\'s why you dropped out,"" Habba said.\n\nDuring the break, Trump also quoted Engoron\'s remark without context in a post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court\n\nAt least one other former president has testified in court after having left office — Teddy Roosevelt did so twice.\n\nIn 1913, the 26th president was a plaintiff in a civil suit against a Michigan newspaper that had accused him of being a drunk. The second was a civil case in which Roosevelt was sued by a New York Republican Party boss he’d accused of being corrupt. Roosevelt won both cases.\n\nNBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg breaks down Trump’s possible motives for sparring with Engoron while testifying in his civil fraud trial.\n\nThe court has left for a lunch break\n\nand\n\nThe court adjourned at about 12:50 p.m. ET for lunch. The proceedings are expected to resume again at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom with a team of aides and his lawyers, quickly passing reporters in the hallway again with no comment, but flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nJames also passed by reporters in the hallway but did not comment.\n\nTrump interrupts questioning to read from a document he pulled from his pocket\n\nMinutes ago, Trump pulled a paper out of his pocket, saying he wanted to read it. But the attorney general\'s lawyer pivoted to another question, and Trump rested the document to his right on the witness stand.\n\nTrump then interrupted the lawyer, saying he just wanted to read the document, and turned to the judge for an answer.\n\nEngoron told him no.\n\n“I am shocked,” Trump said.\n\nIt\'s unclear what the document is.\n\nTrump trains his ire on Engoron\n\nand\n\nLosing his composure, Trump then focused his ire on the judge, saying Engoron ruled against him before knowing anything about his company.\n\nTrump said the judge called him a ""fraud,"" raising his voice and pointing his right hand at the judge while looking straight ahead at the courtroom. He then said any fraud was on the part of the judge for his comments on the value of Trump\'s properties, not on Trump, calling it ""a terrible thing.""\n\nEngoron just looked forward, sour-faced.\n\n""Done?"" Wallace asked when Trump ended his outburst.\n\n“Done,” the former president said.\n\nTrump has essentially brought his rants inside the courtroom. Before, he would be well mannered during his appearances here; it was outside where he lost his cool. Now he\'s losing it on the witness stand.\n\nTrump defiantly asserts his wealth, calls James a \'hack\'\n\nand\n\nAs Trump was asked questions about additional properties, the former president said he is worth billions of dollars more than Attorney General Letitia James has said.\n\nPeople don\'t recognize the strength of the company he built because James\' office is trying to ""demean"" and ""hurt"" him, Trump claimed.\n\n“I think she is a political hack,” he said about the attorney general.\n\nHe repeated a common refrain of his online, calling the trial a political witch hunt and saying James should be ashamed of herself.\n\nWhile testifying in his New York civil fraud trial, Trump sparred with Engoron about his business dealings and claimed the trial was politically motivated. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard reports on what Trump said under oath so far.\n\nTrump appears restless during testimony\n\nand\n\nAs he testifies, Trump is leaning way back in his chair and has his arms crossed on his chest. He also appears a bit restless, slightly swaying his body back and forth.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, when Wallace would ask him to refer to pages of documents before him, Trump would only look at a screen provided in the courthouse, unlike a typical witness who would refer to the pages in his or her hands.\n\nTrump says he thought several valuations were \'too high\'\n\nand\n\nAs questioning continued about Trump\'s properties, the former president said he thought several valuations were ""too high,"" including of his Trump Tower triplex in 2014.\n\nAsked why the valuation was too high, Trump said a broker assessed the total area as 30,000 square feet, ""and I have access to the roof, and when you add the roof, you’re not that far off.” He said, ""I see how it was done,"" telling the court that ""they took 10,000 per floor"" and ""times three"" and didn’t take out the elevator shaft and other things.\n\nHe added, “There\'s a disclaimer clause, so if there is a mistake ... you don\'t get sued by the attorney general\'s office.”\n\nIn his earlier deposition, Trump referred to a disclaimer clause in the company\'s financial statements ""that says, don’t believe the statement, go out and do your own work. This statement is \'worthless.\' It means nothing.""\n\nBut in his late-September ruling ahead of the trial, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nEngoron cuts off Trump and prosecutor repeats questions\n\nand\n\nShortly after Trump resumed testimony, Engoron cut off the former president after Trump started to go on after answering a question about the value of an Avenue of the Americas property.\n\nAt another point, Trump veered into his focusing on China, Russia, and keeping the U.S. safe while president, the attorney general\'s lawyer said, “The question was actually about this property value.”\n\n""The question was"" and ""let me ask again"" are becoming familiar refrains as Trump doesn\'t answer the questions.\n\nTrump has returned to the courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump walked back into the courtroom at about 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\nHe turned to reporters in the hallway and gave a silent thumbs-up before following his lawyers through the courtroom doors.\n\nThe judge also entered the courtroom and everyone stood.\n\nWhen he resumed testimony, Trump began answering questions more succinctly.\n\nTrump leaves for a break without addressing reporters\n\nTrump exited the courtroom for a 15-minute break, walking quickly past reporters in the hallway.\n\nWhen asked, ""How\'s it going in there?"" Trump gestured as if zipping his lips and continued to walk away with his lawyers.\n\nBreak called; Trump leaves stand\n\nThe court is taking a break. Trump has left the witness stand.\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyers: \'I beseech you to control him\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe judge is again asking Trump\'s lawyers to have him answer questions directly while on the stand.\n\n""That was a simple yes-no answer,"" the judge said. ""I beseech you to control him.""\n\nThe judge went back and forth with Kise, with the judge saying, ""I don\'t want to hear everything he has to say.""\n\nHabba then told the judge that Wallace needs to ask better questions, saying, ""More succinct questions will give more succinct answers.""\n\n""We are not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron responded. ""We are here to have him answer questions.""\n\n""It\'s not that simple,"" Habba replied.\n\n""I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!"" Engoron then said, raising his voice.\n\nThe testy exchange prompted Trump to comment, ""This is a very unfair trial. I hope the public is watching.""\n\nThe judge\'s warnings are critical, as the case here is only meant to determine monetary damages. If Engoron determines that all of Trump\'s testimony is not credible, as he did the last time Trump took the stand, he may impose significant financial damages on Trump and his company.\n\nAttorney in hush money case audibly laughs\n\nand\n\nAs Trump continued to testify, one of his attorneys in the separate hush money case being brought by the Manhattan district attorney could be heard laughing in the second row of the courtroom as she observed and took notes.\n\nTrump says he thought Mar-a-Lago\'s value was underestimated\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhen asked about Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he thought its value was underestimated, but added that he didn\'t do anything about it.\n\nTrump referred to the attorney general\'s estimation that the Florida property was worth far less than he claimed (the AG’s office had noted the Palm Beach County assessor appraised its market value to be $18 million to $28 million from 2011 to 2021, while Trump’s balance sheet put its value at $426 million to $612 million).\n\nTrump claimed on the stand that the property was 50 to 100 times the state\'s estimation. He said he doesn\'t know how the lower estimation was arrived at, calling it ""absolutely crazy.""\n\nTrump says he thought his apartment was \'overvalued\'\n\nand\n\nTrump testified that he thought his Manhattan apartment ""was overvalued when I looked at it.""\n\n""But you never know because people come along and could say it\'s worth $250 million. It only takes one person to buy it,"" he said. ""I thought it was high and it is the brand value.""\n\n""The brand value is a very big part of the asset value of the company,"" he added. ""I could have added brand value and increased the value, and my financial statement would be very substantial.""\n\nEngoron asks Trump lawyers to control him\n\nJudge Engoron asked Trump\'s attorneys if they could control him in the courtroom. He said, ""This is not a political rally … maybe you need to have a talk with him right now.""\n\nKise calls Trump the \'future\' U.S. president, citing New York Times/Siena poll\n\nand\n\nDuring questioning, Trump attorney Chris Kise referred to his client as the future president of the United States, citing a poll released yesterday by The New York Times.\n\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with Siena College, found that Trump is leading Biden in five out of six battleground states.\n\nTrump distances himself from his financial statements\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAsked about the exaggerated financial statements at the heart of the case, Trump said that he knew little about them, and that banks didn\'t care about them.\n\n“All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary to supply the accountants for the statements,"" he said. ""I authorized whatever they needed to do to get their statement done.”\n\nAs for the bankers that the AG maintains were duped into giving him more favorable loans than he was entitled to, Trump said, ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump says judge will rule against him\n\nand\n\n“What did you do to meet your responsibility of preparation of the financial statement,” James’ office asked.\n\nTrump said: “Me personally? First of all this was so long ago this is past statute of limitations.”\n\nTrump then insisted that Engoron will “rule against me because he will always rule against me.”\n\nEngoron pushed back, saying that Trump’s claim isn’t true, and asked him to please answer the question again: “You can attack me all you want, but just answer the question.”\n\nJudge tells Trump to be more \'responsive\'\n\nAt one point as Trump started to testify, Engoron asked him to ""please move it along and answer the questions.""\n\n""Some of the questions haven\'t been responsive,"" the judge added.\n\nTrump looked ahead as the judge said this, never turning toward him.\n\nTrump claims bankers didn’t pay attention to the financial statements\n\nand\n\nTrump said his team will bring in bankers who ""paid little attention"" to financial documents.\n\n“This crazy trial goes along. We will bring in bankers. They will explain what the process is,"" he said. ""They paid little attention to documents. They were more interested in the deal.”\n\nTrump rails against AG and prosecutors, calling them \'all haters\'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the AG\'s office, asked Trump about the appointment and acceptance of trustees, and in response, he said, ""You and every other Democrat … coming after me from 15 different sides … all haters.""\n\nHe was referring to the New York attorney general and U.S. attorneys.\n\nTrump has been sworn in\n\nTrump has been sworn in inside the courtroom, kicking off his testimony.\n\nTrump has taken the stand\n\nThe former president is now in the witness stand, where he will be questioned by prosecutors.\n\nTrump and Engoron enter courtroom\n\nand\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom and is seated at the defense table with his hands clasped together.\n\nHe\'s been chatting with his lawyers, Chris Kise and Alina Habba.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has entered the courtroom.\n\nIt will be a tale of two Donalds on Monday: The one inside court, who has generally maintained his composure aside from a few facial expressions and a waving of the arms, and the one outside, who goes off on Engoron and his law clerk and a legal system that he claims is arrayed against him and his family.\n\nJames arrives at courthouse, says numbers \'don\'t lie\'\n\nJames arrived at the courthouse and told reporters outside that the facts and the numbers don\'t lie.\n\n""Trump has repeatedly and consistently misrepresented the value of his assets,"" she said. ""I’m certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting and call this a witch hunt. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friends, don’t lie.""\n\nOnce inside, James greeted the prosecutors in a show of support, shaking hands with the visitors sitting in the front row.\n\nWhat to expect from Trump\'s testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to take the witness stand in a New York courtroom Monday, testifying in a high-stakes civil case that could lead to the dismantling of his sprawling business empire.\n\nHe was deposed in April after James filed her bombshell suit alleging that he and his company inflated their assets to the tune of billions of dollars to get more favorable rates from banks and insurers, and his answers there are likely to be a guidepost about how he’ll be questioned Monday.\n\nTrump spent about seven hours in the deposition answering questions from the attorney general’s office and disavowing responsibility for the annual statements of financial condition, which say “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump testified that he considered the financial statements as being “worthless” and not “important” because they contained a clause that said, “the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon the disposition of the assets or payment of the related liabilities.”\n\nIn his deposition, Trump referred to that as a “clause in there that says, don’t believe the statement, go and do your own work. The statement is worthless. It means nothing.”\n\nIn his Oct. 2 ruling, Engoron shot down Trump’s claim. “The clause does not use the words ‘worthless’ or ‘useless’ or ‘ignore’ or any similar words,” Engoron wrote. “It does not say ‘the values herein are what I think the properties will be worth in ten or more years.’”\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe courtroom is at full capacity ahead of Trump\'s testimony\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nThe courtroom has reached full capacity in anticipation of Trump\'s testimony today.\n\nThe line to get into the courtroom is still long and the number of photographers in the hallway is the highest it has been since the beginning of the trial. Some friends of the judge and his clerk are seated in the front row excited to witness history.\n\nEngoron has expanded a gag order to include members of the former president\'s legal team. The order was issued after the judge claimed they made “inappropriate remarks” about his law clerk.\n\nAnti-Trump protesters are outside the courthouse\n\nand\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters gathered outside the courthouse this morning, holding a banner that reads, ""Invoke the 14th.""\n\nThe protesters advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment against Trump to block him from the ballot in his 2024 presidential run briefly stopped traffic along Centre Street. Police moved them across the street into Foley Square and traffic has since resumed.\n\nTrump leaves for the courthouse\n\nTrump\'s motorcade has departed from Trump Tower and is en route to the courthouse.\n\nTrump lashes out at Engoron and James ahead of testimony\n\nAhead of his highly anticipated testimony today, Trump took aim at Engoron and James in a post on Truth Social this morning, despite Engoron\'s gag order barring the former president and his lawyers from discussing the judge’s staff.\n\nIn his post, Trump denied wrongdoing as he repeated his claims that the trial is a political hit job against him orchestrated by Engoron and James.\n\n""Got a really Biased, Nasty, Club controlled, but often overturned, Judge, a Racist, Evil, and Corrupt Attorney General, BUT A CASE THAT, ACCORDING TO ALMOST ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS, HAS ZERO MERIT,"" he wrote. ""A dark day for our Country. WITCH HUNT!”\n\nTrump testified in the trial briefly — and then stormed out of court\n\nTrump stormed out of a New York City courtroom Oct. 25 after a heated day in court in which the former president was called to the witness stand in his $250 million state fraud case and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nTrump’s abrupt departure appeared to surprise even his own lawyers and his Secret Service agents, who went scurrying after him. He returned to the courtroom in Manhattan after the court day ended and after Cohen finished his contentious testimony.\n\nEngoron handed down the financial penalty after having called Trump to testify under oath in the afternoon about whom he was talking about when he told reporters earlier in the day that the person sitting next to the judge was “very partisan.”\n\nTrump said he was referring to Cohen, whom he has called a rat, a liar and a felon. Engoron said he found Trump’s brief testimony “not credible.” He fined Trump for violating the gag order he issued this month after Trump had smeared his law clerk on social media.\n\nA red-faced and angry-looking Trump stormed out of the courtroom about 45 minutes later after Engoron denied a motion from his lawyers on a separate legal issue.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nHighlights from Eric Trump and Don Jr.\'s testimony last week\n\nDuring his testimony last week, Eric largely asserted that he lacked knowledge of the details of Trump Organization property appraisals and financial statements. The former president’s second-oldest son described himself as a “construction guy,” saying, “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals.”\n\nAt one point, however, he did acknowledge an awareness of his father’s financial statements dating as far back as 2013.\n\nTrump\'s eldest son, Don Jr., the first of the two to take the stand, said during his testimony that he didn’t recall the details of several documents shown to him in court. He added that he relied on the Trump Organization’s accountants and accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nTrump attorney Chris Kise, meanwhile, continued Friday to complain about the judge, pointing to stories in right-wing news outlets alleging Engoron and his clerk have made political donations to Democrats. Kise pointed to a story that alleged the clerk made donations in excess of legal limits for court staff in violation of court rules, and that the judge was notified and did nothing about it, which Kise said could be grounds for a mistrial if true.\n\nEngoron called the allegations untrue, adding, ""It\'s a shame we have descended to this level.""'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-worst-day-ny-fraud-trial-thanks-to-defense-witness-2023-11', 'Headline': 'Trump Has Worst Day yet in NY Fraud Trial Thanks to His Own Witness ...', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump had his worst day yet in his ongoing civil fraud trial in New York on Tuesday at the hands of his own key witness, a former Trump Organization executive who linked the former president directly to the fuzzy math at the center of the case.', 'Full_text': 'The Trump civil fraud trial is now in its eighth week in New York.\n\nThe defense called Donald Trump\'s former spreadsheet czar Jeffrey McConney to testify.\n\nMcConney said he wrote ""DJT TO GET FINAL REVIEW"" on a document the state alleges is fraud-filled.\n\nDonald Trump had his worst day yet in his ongoing civil fraud trial in New York on Tuesday at the hands of his own key witness, a former Trump Organization executive who linked the former president directly to the fuzzy math at the center of the case.\n\nThe witness was Jeffrey McConney, who was the comptroller and spreadsheet czar at the Trump Org. McConney had been called to the witness stand by the defense, but on cross-examination by lawyers for the state attorney general\'s office Tuesday, he linked Trump firmly to the conspiracy and fraud counts that have yet to be decided in the non-jury trial.\n\nMcConney was handed People\'s Exhibit 3054, a draft of Trump\'s net-worth statement for 2014. He was asked to look at a note scribbled in thin blue ink on the draft\'s first page, ""DJT TO GET FINAL REVIEW,"" which he said he\'d written.\n\nTrump has denied involvement in preparing a decade\'s worth of these annual net-worth statements, which New York\'s attorney general, Letitia James, has alleged — and the trial judge has agreed — were each year riddled with billions of dollars of exaggerations.\n\nThe AG has alleged the net-worth statement that McConney was handed the draft for, from 2014, contained $3.5 billion in exaggerations.\n\n""Donald Trump would get final review?"" Andrew Amer, the state\'s lawyer, asked McConney.\n\n""That was my understanding, yes,"" McConney answered from the witness stand, his voice gruff.\n\nAmer asked next whether Trump would get the final review of every net-worth statement until leaving for the White House in 2017, after which Eric Trump would approve the drafts.\n\n""That was my understanding, yes,"" McConney answered again. Asked whether that was his handwriting on the drafts — the thin blue pen marks — McConney also said yes, it was.\n\nWhy the spreadsheet czar\'s scribbles matter\n\nMcConney\'s testimony was significant for several reasons — not just the damage it did to Trump, but the damage it did to Trump\'s two eldest sons; to the Trump Org\'s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg; and to McConney himself.\n\nThe three Trumps and the two ex-executives are all defendants in the AG\'s lawsuit, which alleges that Trump used net-worth exaggerations to win hundreds of millions of dollars in interest-rate discounts and property-sale profits. James is seeking at least $250 million in penalties and to bar the five defendants from ever running a New York business again.\n\nStarting with the damage to McConney himself, his blue-ink notations directly contradict his testimony from the prior day.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe spreadsheet czar had testified on direct examination Monday that he would review each year\'s draft net-worth statement with Weisselberg, who would then give the approved draft to the outside accounting firm, Mazars USA, which would print the final statement.\n\nThis chain of command — McConney to Weisselberg to Mazars — leaves out one very important link, as the state\'s lawyer, Amer, pointed out on cross on Tuesday.\n\n""I believe there was a step in between that involved Donald Trump prior to 2017?"" Amer said to McConney, who appeared uncomfortable on the stand as he said Trump indeed did the ultimate signing off.\n\nTrump, who has not attended the trial for the past two weeks, had said on the witness stand on November 6 that he had little involvement in the drafting of these net-worth statements. In a pretrial deposition, he denied knowing who had written ""DJT to get final review"" on that 2014 draft.\n\nBut McConney\'s blue-ink handwriting is all over the net-worth statement drafts, showing he revised language and even added cautionary notes that were then passed along for Trump\'s ""final review,"" as McConney said in his own description of the drafting process.\n\nIn one key cautionary note from the 2015 draft, McConney made a notation in ink that ""this computation also includes forecasted deals that have not signed yet."" In the note, McConney asked whether Trump wanted to exclude some $151 million in as-yet-fictional assets from the net-worth statement.\n\nThe final version of that year\'s net-worth statement shows McConney\'s suggestion was ignored, possibly by Trump himself. The AG alleges that Trump routinely padded out his net-worth statements with the same sorts of nonexistent assets.\n\nMcConney\'s many handwritten notes indicate it was Trump and his top executives who made the last edits and then signed off on these net-worth statements. As such, the notes do serious damage to the primary Trump defense: blame Mazars, blame the accountants.\n\nThe attorney general\'s office also appears poised to argue that these handwritten notes show McConney, Weisselberg, and Trump intentionally conspired in cooking the numbers each year. Intent and conspiracy are two elements that must be proved for the attorney general to win all six of the yet-decided counts in the case.\n\nStill to be proved or disproved: conspiracy and intent\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron has already found, pretrial, that Trump\'s 2014-through-2021 statements fraudulently inflated his wealth.\n\nThe trial is meant to determine whether the five defendants further broke six specific state laws: falsifying business records, filing false financial statements, insurance fraud, and conspiracy to commit each of these counts. These six counts all require proof that the frauds and falsehoods were committed intentionally.\n\nSince the case is civil, not criminal, the judge will not issue a ""guilty"" verdict. Instead, his verdict will find whether the five defendants are ""liable"" for monetary and other penalties for violating these six laws.\n\nHow else do McConney\'s handwritten notes harm the defense?\n\nThe fact that these incriminating, hand-scrawled drafts were turned over to authorities by Mazars but not by the Trump Organization could come up at the end of the trial as evidence that Trump\'s side failed to retain and turn over documents as required by state subpoenas.\n\nMcConney\'s cross-examination came minutes after a dramatic, tearful conclusion to his direct testimony.\n\nThe longtime Trump executive became weepy in answering the final question from the defense lawyer Jesus Suarez, who asked why he\'d left the Trump Organization after 35 years working there.\n\nHe left to ""stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for,"" he said, wiping away tears as he described a history of being subpoenaed on the federal and state level in connection with the Trump Organization.\n\n""It was like working with family,"" he said. ""I feel proud of what I did.""\n\nThe trial continues Monday with testimony expected by the chief accounting officer for Trump Hotels, Mark Hawthorn.

NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein was there and joins us now. Hey, Andrea.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: OK, so it sounds like Trump got some backup for his defense today.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes. Trump\'s lawyers called, as their penultimate witness, Dr. Eli Bartov, a highly credentialed accounting professor from New York University who had once served as an expert witness for the New York attorney general\'s office.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter) OK.\n\nBERNSTEIN: And Bartov just jumped right in saying, quote, ""there is no evidence whatsoever for accounting fraud."" He sounded like a classroom professor, repeating phrases and saying things like parts of the attorney general\'s complaint, quote, ""border on the absurd"" and that, quote, ""no valuations are objective because they are, by definition, opinions."" He added, if somebody tells you an evaluation is objective, they need to have their head examined. And the witness said that a disclaimer in Trump\'s statements of financial condition makes it clear that no one should take them at face value, and this was so obvious even his 9-year-old granddaughter could understand.\n\nCHANG: Interesting testimony. OK, so how did the AG\'s office respond to all of that?\n\nBERNSTEIN: They really wanted to make it clear that Professor Bartov is not an expert in banking or real estate valuations. At one point, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace objected saying, quote, ""this is pure speculation from somebody they hired to say whatever they want,"" at which point Bartov turned to Wallace and said, quote, ""you should be ashamed. You make up allegations, and you say I say whatever I want. You should be ashamed of yourself talking to me like that,"" which is, of course, highly unusual...\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nBERNSTEIN: ...For a witness. This was right before lunch. And I did catch Trump lawyer Alina Habba smiling as she turned to leave.\n\nCHANG: And am I understanding this correctly? Trump stayed all day to hear this witness.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes, even though it got quite repetitive. Trump knows that when he\'s in the courtroom, we, the press, are there. And we heard Professor Bartov saying the kinds of things that Trump likes to say like, I\'ve never seen a financial statement that provided so much detail. And then, of course, there are all those TV cameras out in the hallway capturing Donald Trump\'s words when he leaves and when he says things like, he should be in Iowa campaigning. Now, of course, he could be in Iowa. He is here fully by his own choice.\n\nCHANG: So what\'s next for Trump in this trial?\n\nBERNSTEIN: So in action outside of this courtroom, Trump got some relief today when an appeals court panel affirmed a judge\'s decision from earlier this fall that the dissolution of Trump\'s business would remain on hold until this trial is over. You might remember that before the trial even began, the judge found on one cause of action for the attorney general and said that Trump would have to start canceling his business certificates. But that was paused.\n\nAnd Trump has also lost his efforts, so far, to overturn a gag order that prevents him from disparaging the judge\'s clerk. Trump\'s lawyers had complained that this violated Trump\'s First Amendment rights, but both the trial judge and an appeals panel have ruled otherwise, which means when Trump testifies on Monday, he won\'t be able to go after the judge\'s clerk from the witness stand. That\'ll be the last day of the defense case - after that, a day of rebuttal, followed by briefs and final arguments in court in January; sometime mid-next-month, maybe just before or after the Iowa caucuses, a verdict.\n\nCHANG: A lot coming up.

The judge then asked everyone to keep their voices down, “particularly if it’s meant to influence the testimony.”\n\nREAD MORE: Trump employee and appraiser testify against him in civil fraud trial\n\nThe 2024 Republican frontrunner was in court for a second straight day Wednesday, watching the trial that threatens to upend his real estate empire and his wealthy businessman image. He attended the first three days, but skipped last week. On Tuesday, he left during an afternoon break to give a deposition in an unrelated lawsuit.\n\nIn a pretrial decision last month, Engoron ruled that Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, committed years of fraud by exaggerating his asset values and net worth on annual financial statements used to make deals and get better terms on loans and insurance.\n\nAs punishment, Engoron ordered that a court-appointed receiver take control of some Trump companies, putting the future oversight of Trump Tower and other marquee properties in question, but an appeals court has blocked that for now.\n\nTrump didn’t talk about the case on his way into court past TV cameras Wednesday, saving his usual vitriol about New York Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit for a morning break.\n\nInside the courtroom, which is closed to cameras, Trump grew irritated as Larson testified. Trump’s lawyers were seeking to undercut the state’s claims that his top corporate deputies played games to inflate the values of his properties and pad his bottom line.\n\nIn a series of questions, Trump lawyer Lazaro Fields sought to establish that Larson had, at one point, undershot the projected 2015 value of a Trump-owned Wall Street office building by $114 million. Larson said the “values were not wrong — it’s what we knew at the time.”\n\nTrump threw up his hands during the exchange.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump’s fraudulent financial statements were key to getting loans, former bank official says\n\nOn Tuesday, Larson testified that he never consulted with or gave permission for the Trump Organization’s former controller, Jeffrey McConney, to cite him as an outside expert in the valuation spreadsheets he used to create Trump’s financial statements.\n\nFields on Wednesday accused Larson of lying, pointing to a decade-old email exchange between McConney and the appraiser.\n\nThat touched off an angry back-and-forth between the defense and state sides, with Trump lawyer Christopher Kise suggesting that Larson could risk perjuring himself and needed to be advised about his rights against self-incrimination. State lawyer Colleen Faherty called Kise’s comments “witness intimidation.”\n\nAfter Larson was escorted out of the courtroom, Kise insisted that he was trying to protect the witness’ rights, while state lawyer Kevin Wallace complained that the defense was mounting “a performance” for the media. Ultimately, Engoron allowed Larson to return and answer the question with no legal warning. Larson said he didn’t recall the email.\n\nAsked again whether he understood that McConney had asked for his input in order to carry out valuations, a weary Larson said: “That’s what it appears.”\n\nTrump railed about that exchange during a court break.\n\n“See what’s happened? The government lied. They just lie. They didn’t reveal all of the information that they had,” Trump said. “They didn’t reveal all the evidence that made me totally innocent of anything that they say.”\n\nAfter Larson, state lawyers called Jack Weisselberg, the son of former longtime Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg. The son arranged financing for Trump while an executive at Ladder Capital.\n\nTrump’s civil trial involves six claims in James’ lawsuit that weren’t resolved in Engoron’s pretrial ruling, including allegations of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. Engoron will decide the case, not a jury, because state law doesn’t allow one in this type of lawsuit.\n\nWednesday’s dust-up was just the latest clash between Engoron and Trump.\n\nAfter Trump maligned a key court staffer on social media on the trial’s second day, the judge, a Democrat, issued a limited gag order barring parties in the case from smearing members of his staff. Last year, Engoron held Trump in contempt and fined him $110,000 for being slow to respond to a subpoena from James’ office.\n\nTrump on Tuesday said outside court that he had grown to like and respect Engoron, but that he believed Democrats were “pushing him around like a pinball.” “It’s a very unfair situation that they put me in,” Trump said.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jill Colvin contributed to this report.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.fox5ny.com/news/donald-trump-witness-stand-testifies-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump lashes out from the witness stand at judge, NY ... - FOX 5 New York', 'Snippet': 'A defiant Donald Trump has sparred with a New York judge and slammed the state attorney general suing him, using the witness stand at his civil fraud trial to defend his riches and lash out at a case that imperils his real estate empire.', 'Full_text': 'A defiant Donald Trump sparred with a New York judge and slammed the state attorney general suing him Monday, using the witness stand at his civil fraud trial to defend his riches and lash out at a case that imperils his real estate empire.\n\nThe former president’s barbed testimony spurred the judge to admonish, ""This is not a political rally.""\n\nTrump\'s long-awaited testimony about property valuations and financial statements was punctuated by personal jabs at state Judge Arthur Engoron, who he said was biased against him, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he derided as a ""political hack."" He proudly boasted of his real estate business — ""I\'m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements"" — and disputed claims that he had deceived banks and insurers.\n\nFeatured\n\n""This is the opposite of fraud,"" he declared. Referring to James, a Democrat whose office brought the lawsuit, he said, ""The fraud is her.""\n\nThe testy exchanges and frequent rebukes from the judge underscored Trump’s unwillingness to adapt his famously freewheeling rhetorical style to a formal courtroom setting governed by rules of evidence and legal protocol. His presence on the stand was a vivid reminder of the legal troubles he faces as he vies to reclaim the White House in 2024.\n\nIt also functioned as a campaign platform for the former president and leading Republican presidential candidate to raise anew to supporters his claims of political persecution at the hands of government lawyers and judges.\n\nFeatured\n\n""People are sick and tired of what’s happening. I think it is a very sad day for America,"" Trump told reporters outside the courtroom after roughly three-and-a-half hours on the stand.\n\nThe fraud case doesn’t carry the prospect of prison as Trump\'s upcoming criminal cases do. But its allegations of financial impropriety cut to the very heart of the brand he spent decades crafting. Engoron has already ruled that Trump committed fraud by inflating his financial statements, putting the the ex-president’s future control of Trump Tower and his other marquee properties into question.\n\nThe non-jury trial addresses other claims in the lawsuit brought by James against Trump, his company and top executives, including his eldest sons. She wants the defendants to fork over what she claims is more than $300 million in ill-gotten gains and to be banned from doing business in New York.\n\nFeatured\n\nThe civil trial is one of numerous legal proceedings facing Trump as he runs for a second term, including federal and state charges accusing him of crimes including illegally hoarding classified documents and scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election. His legal and political strategies have now become completely intertwined as he hopscotches between campaign events and court hearings, a schedule that will only intensify once his criminal trials begin.\n\nTrump has been particularly engaged in his fraud trial, aggrieved by the suggestion that he’s worth less than he’s claimed.\n\n""I’m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements,"" he said Monday on the stand, telling a state lawyer, ""You go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me, probably for political reasons.""\n\nFeatured\n\nHis testimony got off to a contentious start, with the judge turning to Trump’s attorney at one point and saying: ""I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t, I will.""\n\nThe courtroom at 60 Centre Street had already become a familiar destination for Trump, who spent days over the past month voluntarily seated at the defense table, observing the proceedings. He took the stand once before — unexpectedly and briefly — after he was accused of violating a partial gag order. He denied violating the rules, but Engoron disagreed and fined him anyway.\n\nHis turn as a witness gave him the biggest opportunity yet to respond to allegations against him.\n\nSummoned by lawyers for the state, Trump repeatedly bristled at the suggestion that he had ever intended to defraud financial institutions. He said he had been misquoted or taken too literally in past public comments about his business dealings and his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said disclaimers in his financial statements covered any missteps. He returned to a familiar position that no one had been victimized, though state lawyers contend that Trump was able to get lower interest rates and other benefits because of the wealth reflected on his financial statements.\n\n""Not one bank lost money. Not one insurance company lost money,"" he declared.\n\nTensions between Engoron and Trump — already on display in recent weeks, when the judge fined him a total of $15,000 for incendiary outside-of-court comments — were evident early on Monday when the ex-president was repeatedly scolded about the length and content of his answers.\n\nEngoron, who determined in a ruling earlier that Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, will decide the non-jury case. He cautioned at one point that he was prepared to draw ""negative inferences"" against the former president if he failed to rein in his answers.\n\n""I do not want to hear everything this witness has to say. He has a lot to say that has nothing to do with the case or the questions,"" the judge said.\n\nDespite the testy back-and-forth early in the day, Trump was later able to veer into expansive answers without anyone cutting him off, using the opportunity to rail against James, the judge and the proceedings in general.\n\n""I think that she’s a political hack, and I think she used this case to try and become governor, and she used it successfully to become attorney general. I think it’s a disgrace that this case is going on,"" Trump said.\n\nOf Engoron, Trump said, ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me.""\n\nJames, who was in the courtroom, stared straight ahead at Trump as he spoke and was seen chuckling when Trump suggested she didn\'t know anything about one of his properties, which is located across the street from her office. Afterward, she told reporters: ""He rambled. He hurled insults. But we expected that.""\n\nMonday’s testimony centered on the core of the allegations by the state attorney general: that Trump and his company intentionally inflated property values and deceived banks and insurers in the pursuit of business deals and loans.\n\nEchoing the stance taken by two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, in their own testimony last week, Trump sought to downplay his direct involvement in preparing and assessing financial statements that the attorney general claims were grossly inflated and fraudulent.\n\n""All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements,"" he said. As for the results, ""I would look at them, I would see them and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.""\n\nHe also played down the significance of the statements, which went to banks and others to secure financing and deals.\n\n""Banks didn’t find them very relevant, and they had a disclaimer clause -- you would call it a worthless statement clause,"" he said, insisting that after decades in real estate, ""I probably know banks as well as anybody. … I know what they look at. They look at the deal, they look at the location.""\n\nHe complained that his 2014 financial statements shouldn’t be a subject of the lawsuit at all.\n\n""First of all it’s so long ago, it’s well beyond the statute of limitations,"" Trump said before turning on Engoron, saying he allowed state lawyers to pursue claims involving such years-old documents ""because he always rules against me.""\n\nEngoron said, ""You can attack me in whichever way you want, but please answer the questions.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/66989373', 'Headline': ""Fact-checking Trump's claims about New York fraud trial - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.

There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-testify-defense-new-york-civil-fraud-trial-rcna126834', 'Headline': 'Trump to testify in his own defense in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': ""Former President Donald Trump will take the stand in his own defense next month in his $250 million civil fraud trial, his attorneys said in court Monday.

Both have already testified in the case as witnesses for New York Attorney General Letitia James\' office, who\'s suing the Trumps and their company alleging they inflated financial statements to the tune of billions of dollars.\n\nSeparately, Trump\'s attorneys told a New York state appeals court Monday that he\'s not responsible for what court officials have called a ""deluge"" of threats against the law clerk of the judge presiding over the civil fraud trial. They also dismissed the assertion in a court filing last week that Trump has endangered the clerk\'s safety.\n\nThe ""purported security concerns lack good faith and substance,"" and ""the communications themselves, while vile and reprehensible, do not constitute a clear and present danger of imminent harm,"" Trump\'s lawyers argued in a filing to the state Appellate Division, urging it to leave in place a pause of Judge Arthur Engoron\'s gag order barring Trump and his attorneys from publicly discussing the clerk.\n\nIn last week\'s filing, lawyers for the state court system urged the appeals court to end a temporary pause on the gag order, arguing that ever since Trump posted about the clerk on social media last month, she has been subjected to ""hundreds of threatening, harassing, disparaging and antisemitic messages,"" including on her personal cellphone and email. A court security official, Charles Hollon, submitted a sworn affirmation saying that some of the threats against the judge and the clerk ""are considered to be serious and credible and not hypothetical or speculative"" and that they led to increased security.\n\nTrump\'s attorneys said that their client had no involvement with the threats and that he shouldn’t be prohibited from airing his belief that the clerk is biased against him.\n\n""The Constitution does not permit Justice Engoron to curtail [Trump\'s] speech simply because people may react to things that President Trump says,"" they wrote.\n\nThe state Office of Court Administration, on behalf of Engoron, argued differently in its filing. ""The First Amendment does not prohibit courts from limiting speech that threatens the safety of the court’s staff,"" its lawyer Lisa Evans wrote.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Kise said the gag order ""seeks to shield the Court from the scrutiny essential to maintaining public confidence in the judiciary and the rule of law. So, it is beyond outrageous that an unconstitutional gag order could prevent the frontrunning presidential candidate from speaking about obvious, public, and partisan conduct which has denied him a fair trial.”\n\nThe state attorney general\'s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on Trump\'s filing.\n\nEngoron issued the gag order on the second day of the trial after Trump posted a picture of the clerk posing with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and baselessly claimed that she had a romantic relationship with him, an allegation Schumer\'s office has called ""ridiculous, absurd, and false."" The picture was taken at a political event while the clerk was running for a judgeship, and it had originally been posted on her campaign\'s Instagram page.\n\n“Personal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it,” Engoron said after he found out about Trump\'s social media post and comments he made to reporters about the clerk.\n\nIn their filing Monday, Trump\'s lawyers called it ""manufactured outrage,"" because the clerk ""herself initially posted the very same photograph on a public Instagram account explicitly linked to her judicial campaign, with her name in the handle."" The clerk made the page private after Trump\'s post appeared on Truth Social.\n\nAfter the gag order was imposed, Trump\'s lawyers repeatedly complained about the clerk in court, saying she\'d been showing bias by rolling her eyes and whispering to the judge while they were questioning witnesses. They also took issue with her physical proximity to Engoron and said she appears to be acting as a ""co-judge,"" an allegation that Engoron has repeatedly — and angrily — denied.\n\nEngoron expanded his gag order to include the lawyers this month and said he will “continue to consult with my staff, as is my unfettered right, throughout the remainder of the trial.”\n\nTrump\'s lawyers countered that Engoron ""feels compelled to repeatedly justify his abnormal practices and assure the public that he, not his law clerk, is fulfilling his judicial duties, underscores the bizarre and deeply problematic nature of his practices. There is simply no room in the judicial system for openly partisan individuals to participate at all in the decision-making process.""\n\nThey also contended that the clerk\'s ""heightened public role"" in the case, including allowing herself to be photographed in court sitting by the judge, ""renders her a public figure, subject to public criticism, for purposes of the proceeding.""\n\nThe ""purported security concerns are disingenuous given the Principal Law Clerk’s voluntary public, partisan posts and political activities and her insistence in remaining as a constant and unprecedented presence on the bench, allowing herself to be filmed and then viewed by an audience of millions since the underlying, extraordinarily high-profile trial commenced,"" the lawyers argued.\n\nIt\'s unclear when the appeals court will rule on the gag order.\n\nDuring Monday\'s court proceedings, Trump\'s attorneys moved to call as a witness Barbara Jones, the retired federal judge whom Engoron appointed as a monitor of financial activity at the Trump Organization. Engoron rejected the request, which came weeks after Trump\'s team began presenting their case. Engoron called the request ""untimely"" and ""inappropriate.""\n\n""I’m not aware of a single instance where a litigant asks to examine an independent monitor,"" he said.\n\nThe witness who was on the stand Monday, Trump Organization executive Mark Hawthorn, testified that he had a good relationship with Jones and her team and that they seemed satisfied with how the company is being run. ""There were concerns they highlighted that required more, and we responded diligently and adequately, but I would say no one from that team communicated to us that they uncovered any fraud or irregularities,"" Hawthorn said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Hawthorn was asked whether he was aware that Jones had reported to the judge that some of the information she\'d gotten from the company was ""incomplete"" and that the company had ""also not consistently provided all required annual and quarterly certifications attesting to the accuracy of certain financial statements."" He replied, ""Yes.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/donald-trump-testify-new-york-fraud-case-that-threatens-his-business-2023-11-06/', 'Headline': 'Trump tangles with judge, complains of treatment at NY fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump complained of unfair treatment in defiant and rambling testimony on the witness stand at the civil fraud trial about his New York business on Monday, prompting the judge at one point to threaten to cut his testimony short.', 'Full_text': ''}}",99.16666666666667,1

I haven\'t said that. I\'m saving it for this big town hall. I\'ve never really said that. I personally don\'t think he makes it,"" Trump answered, to cheers from the audience.\n\n""I think he\'s in bad shape physically,"" he added before joking about a previous instance in which Biden said he\'d like to take Trump to the ""back of the barn.""\n\nTrump joked that Biden would ""fall over"" if he simply blew on him.\n\n""I personally don\'t think he makes it physically. I watched him at the beach. He wasn\'t able to lift a beach chair, which is meant for children to lift. And mentally I would say he is possibly equally as bad, and maybe even worse,"" Trump added.\n\n‘DICTATOR\' FOR \'DAY ONE’\n\nThe former president turned some heads with some of his comments during the town hall, most notably with his comments to Hannity\'s question asking Trump to pledge to ""never abuse power as retribution against anybody.""\n\n""Except for day one,"" Trump said. ""I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill.""\n\nHannity said ""that\'s not retribution,"" with Trump quipping back, ""I love this guy, he says, \'you\'re not going to be a dictator are you?\'""\n\n""I said, \'No, no, no, other than day one,"" Trump said.\n\n""We\'re closing the border and we\'re drilling, drilling, drilling,"" Trump said. ""After that, I\'m not a dictator.""\n\nHannity said that it sounded like what Trump was saying was that he would go back to his first-term policies, to which the former president agreed.\n\nTrump\'s comments come after multiple media outlets claimed a second term for the former president would result in a ""dictatorship.""\n\nBiden\'s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez blasted Trump over the comments, saying in a release, ""Donald Trump has been telling us exactly what he will do if he’s reelected and tonight he said he will be a dictator on day one.""\n\n""Americans should believe him,"" she said.\n\n‘TALKING POINTS’: TRUMP RESPONDS TO BIDEN\n\nTrump mocked President Biden for his claim that he wouldn\'t be running for re-election if Trump wasn\'t in the race.\n\n""Well, I think somebody gave him a talking point. They thought that would sound good,"" Trump said as the crowd laughed.\n\n""You know, I just found out that Democrats are funding Nikki Haley\'s campaign. I hear that Democrats are contributing to Ron DeSanctus\', or Ron DeSanctimonious, to Ron DeSanctus\' campaign. And then you hear the talking points. That\'s the only thing they\'re good at, cheating on elections and great talking points,"" Trump added.\n\nBiden made the statement earlier in the day to a group of supporters at a Boston fundraiser, saying, ""If Trump wasn\'t running, I\'m not sure I\'d be running. But we cannot let him win for the sake of the country.""\n\n""I\'M GOING TO WIN IOWA""\n\nTrump came out swinging in his town hall, but one of the biggest moments of the night was the former president calling his shot in the Hawkeye State.\n\nThe former president declared to Fox News\' Sean Hannity that he would ""win Iowa.""\n\nTrump touted the ""hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs"" from China and ""gave the farmers $28 billion.""\n\n""That\'s why I say I\'m going to win Iowa,"" Trump said, eliciting cheers from the Hawkeye State crowd.\n\n""My people say, \'Please sir, don\'t keep saying you\'re going to win Iowa, you sound so, really, horrible, crass\' — someone said \'crass,\'"" Trump continued.\n\n""I said, \'But it\'s true.

Who else would be able to do it, number one, who else would think about it?"" Trump asked, adding that he told farmers to ""buy more land"" and ""bigger tractors.""\n\nBLASTING BIDEN\'S ‘MAGA’ CRITICISM\n\nTrump\'s town hall began with him torching Biden over his criticism of his MAGA movement.\n\n""You know, I see Biden talking about, \'Oh, MAGA! MAGA!\' MAGA means Make America Great Again. That\'s what it means. And that\'s what people want,"" Trump said to cheers from the crowd.\n\n""They want to see our country be great again.

The election rally featuring Donald Trump hit on familiar notes, with a lengthy speech from the ...', 'Full_text': 'The election rally featuring Donald Trump hit on familiar notes, with a lengthy speech from the former president, lots of bashing of Democratic candidates and laments of how conditions have gone south since Joe Biden defeated Trump in 2020.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the daylong event.\n\nBlame it on Biden\n\nThe common theme that ran through comments of all the Arizona candidates at Sunday’s Trump rally was Joe Biden.\n\nFrom complaints about high gas prices to inflation to fentanyl pouring across an unsecured border, the candidates pinned the blame on the president and, by extension, their Democratic opponents.\n\n“You know who supports Joe Biden 100% of the time?” Congressman Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. asked. “Every Democrat.”\n\nKari Lake, the GOP candidate for governor, painted a picture of a country and a state that were moving along smoothly until Biden became president. Then, she said, things went off the rails.\n\nLake compared her rival, Democrat Katie Hobbs, to Biden for her lack of visibility on the campaign trail, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nWhile Biden spent some of the 2020 campaign working from his basement because of COVID-19 concerns, Hobbs is equally underground, Lake suggested. “I call her ‘Basement Hobbs,’” she said.\n\nThe real attraction was Trump\n\nThe crowd at Bell Bank Park in Mesa had staying power.\n\nAs temperatures climbed to 88 degrees under an intense sun, the crowd showed few signs of thinning as people waited for Trump to arrive on stage. Packed, standing shoulder to shoulder, they waited nearly two hours after Lake had finished her speech. In the meantime, they were entertained by a soundtrack that ranged from ""Phantom of the Opera"" to Elvis to Hot Tramp.\n\nFor many of the thousands who attended Sunday, the draw was Trump more so than the Arizona candidates.\n\nAnn-Marie Villicana drove to the southeast Valley from Pasadena, Calif., with Robin Salzer on Saturday. A founder of LA Trump, a group that supports the former president, Villicana said she wanted to add to the enthusiasm for a strong Republican turnout in the midterms and particularly for Kari Lake.\n\nSalzer said he thinks frustration is bringing people out to events like this.\n\n“People are just fed up, and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” he said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Elgin and four friends flew in from Oregon, sporting their red and white Oregon Women for Trump T-shirts.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” she said.\n\nGet ready for lines at the polls Nov. 8\n\nAn informal survey of attendees as they waited for Trump’s arrival showed elections officials should prepare for lines at the polls.\n\nPerson after person leaning against the metal gates that hemmed in the crowd said they would vote at the polls on Nov. 8 because they don’t trust mail-in voting.\n\n“I like to see it go in,” one man said of watching his ballot get fed into the tabulation machine.\n\nTheir attitudes reflect increased skepticism about the reliability of early voting, or vote by mail, that has grown since the 2020 election.\n\nTrump alluded to that distrust in his talk.\n\n“Sometimes the mail-in ballots are just not as good as being out there on Nov. 8,” he said.\n\n“If you can, vote in person on election day,” Trump said. “Because it’s a lot harder for them to cheat.” He did not clarify who he was referring to.\n\nTrump said those who vote by mail risk getting a “potentially fake ballot.”\n\nThere is no evidence of that ever occurring in Arizona.\n\nIn the August primary, Republican voters showed an uptick in voting at the polls, although voting by mail remained by far the most popular form of voting, used by 85% of voters in Maricopa County.\n\nRepublic reporter Alison Steinbach contributed to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-trump-cnn-town-hall-b2336678.html', 'Headline': 'Biden takes aim at Trump town hall with searing one-line critique', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden went after his old 2020 rival on Wednesday as Donald Trump attempted to make his case for a third presidential bid at a CNN town hall.

Do you want four more years of that?” Mr Biden asked.\n\nMr Biden announced his own re-election campaign last month; if elected to serve another four years in office, he would be 86 by the time his term ended, thus making him the oldest president to ever serve.\n\nPolls of the president’s approval rating have shown his base of supporters shrinking over the past several months, and in some Mr Biden trails his potential 2024 GOP challengers Donald Trump or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by several percentage points.\n\nStill, the president remains adamant that he is the best choice for his party’s nominee in 2024 even as wide swaths of the Democratic Party, according to polling, would prefer that he step aside.\n\nMr Biden has pointed to his party’s successful defence of the Senate in last year’s midterm elections as evidence of his own political strength, though the actual dynamics of the congressional and statewide contests are thought to have been affected more by the constant claims of election fraud by Trump-backed candidates and the recent overturn of Roe vs Wade by the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Trump spent the bulk of his time at the CNN town hall on Wednesday repeating those same lies and refusing to take accountability for the attack on the US Capitol, even falsely claiming to have offered thousands of troops when in fact no order to deploy was issued.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/05/factchecking-trumps-cnn-town-hall/', 'Headline': ""FactChecking Trump's CNN Town Hall - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'Posted on May 11, 2023.

Among them: He claimed ...', 'Full_text': 'Former President Donald Trump’s town hall event felt like a lightning round of false and misleading claims — most of which we’ve heard before. Among them:\n\nHe claimed the conservative group True the Vote found Democrats “stuffing ballot boxes” with “millions of votes” and it was caught “on government cameras.” It did not.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that he “didn’t ask” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger “to find” him more votes. In a Jan. 2, 2021, call, Trump told Raffensperger: “I just want to find 11,780 votes,” which was one more than Trump needed to win the state.\n\nThen-Vice President Mike Pence didn’t have the legal right to send electoral votes back to the states, contrary to Trump’s claim that Pence “did something wrong” by not rejecting the votes in states he lost.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that “we have open borders,” when each month border officials have apprehended and expelled tens of thousands of people who illegally enter the country.\n\nHe made an unsubstantiated claim that many of the immigrants coming illegally across the southern border are people released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThe former president wrongly claimed that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to negotiate the return of presidential materials to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nPresident Joe Biden donated 1,850 boxes of records from his Senate years to the University of Delaware. There’s no evidence they contain classified information or that Biden refused to give them “back,” as Trump said.\n\nTrump claimed that “we were energy independent” during his administration, but the U.S. never attained 100% self-sufficiency and still relied on energy imports under Trump.\n\nHe wrongly claimed that U.S. gasoline prices reached $9 under Biden. The highest weekly average price under Biden was about $5 in June 2022.\n\nTrump claimed that under Roe v. Wade, “They could kill the baby … after the baby was born.” The court opinion allowed states to prohibit abortion after fetal viability, with exceptions for the mother’s life and health.\n\nTrump — the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination, despite a criminal indictment in New York and an ongoing criminal investigation in Georgia — took questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in the May 10 prime time event moderated by CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins.\n\nFalse Claims of Vote Fraud\n\nStill refusing to accept the results of an election he lost, Trump made numerous false claims about how the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.” For example, Trump claimed, “If you look at True the Vote, they found millions of votes on camera, on government cameras, where [Democrats] were stuffing ballot boxes.”\n\nTrump is referring to the “2000 Mules” documentary by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, which purported to provide evidence that thousands of so-called “mules” were employed to illegally stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent ballots. The film was based on research from the conservative group True the Vote, which used geotracking data of cellphones and noted people who were near numerous ballot drop boxes and liberal nonprofits. We reviewed the film’s claims and found the evidence lacking.\n\nWhen Georgia investigators looked into a handful of videos showing people depositing multiple ballots, it turned out to be people legally dropping off ballots for eligible voters in their immediate family. The House Jan. 6 committee released video of an interview of former Attorney General Bill Barr, who offered a blistering assessment, calling the cellphone data “singularly unimpressive” and saying the film simply “didn’t establish widespread illegal harvesting.”\n\nCall to Georgia Secretary of State\n\nToward the end of the town hall, Collins revisited the topic of Trump’s baseless voter fraud claims.\n\nCollins asked Trump about his Jan. 2, 2021, phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — which has become the focus of a criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney’s office into whether Trump tried to illegally overturn the state’s 2020 presidential election outcome.\n\nAsked if he would still make that call today, knowing that it would lead to a criminal investigation, Trump said there was nothing wrong with the call and that he was merely “questioning the election.”\n\nCollins: You asked him to find you votes.\n\nTrump: I didn’t ask him to find anything.\n\nThat’s false. Trump asked Raffensperger to find him enough votes so that he could win the state — after Joe Biden had already been certified and recertified as the winner in Georgia.\n\n“I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” Trump told Raffensperger on the call.\n\nSpecifically, Trump told Raffensperger to look in Cobb and Fulton counties — which were both won by Biden. “You will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt,” Trump said on the call.\n\nPence Didn’t Have Right to Reject Electoral Votes\n\nTrump was asked if he owed his vice president, Mike Pence, an apology over what happened during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and Trump’s repeated attempts to push Pence to refuse to count electoral votes.\n\n“No, because he did something wrong,” Trump said. “He should have sent the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would have had a different outcome.”\n\nA constitutional expert told us Pence did not have the legal right to change or reject the electoral votes. The Electoral Count Act, which was signed into law in 1887, says the vice president is simply supposed to hand the tellers the state certifications after he opens them, and the tellers are then to read those documents and make a list of the votes.\n\nAccording to the Jan. 6 committee report, Pence and his counsel Greg Jacob and others told Trump that Pence did not have the authority to send those electoral votes back to the states. Even Trump’s lawyer John Eastman “admitted” that Trump had been advised that the vice president did not have the unilateral power to refuse to count votes under the Electoral College Act, but Trump “continued to pressure the Vice President to act illegally,” the report said.\n\nTrump said Pence and others were wrong, and that the proof is that “right after the election they all met – the RINOs [Republicans in name only] and the Democrats – and they worked out a plan to make sure that future vice presidents don’t do what I said you could do.” Congress revised the Electoral Count Act in December 2022, but only to “reaffirm” that a vice president’s role in the electoral vote counting process is “ministerial.” It was not an admission that the law previously allowed a vice president to take the steps Trump sought.\n\nIllegal Immigration\n\nThe U.S. does not “have open borders,” as Trump falsely claimed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, particularly Border Patrol agents, have continued to apprehend and expel tens of thousands of people who illegally cross the southern border each month, according to the most recent CBP data.\n\nIn the Southwest Border Enforcement Report for fiscal year 2021, which was published in August 2022, the Office of Immigration Statistics said preliminary estimates indicated that the model-based apprehension rate in FY 2021 was about the same as the 78% average from FY 2018 to FY 2020, which were the three fiscal years when Trump was president the whole time. In its August 2020 Border Security Metrics Report, the Department of Homeland Security explained that the model-based apprehension rate is “the estimated share of all attempted unlawful border crossers between land [ports of entries] that is apprehended.”\n\nNo Evidence for Prisons Claim\n\nAs he has numerous times in recent months, Trump made the unsubstantiated claim that many of the immigrants coming illegally across the southern border are people released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\n“Look what is happening at our southern border,” Trump said. “Millions and millions of people are coming in. They’re being released from prisons. They’re being released from mental institutions.”\n\nWe wrote about this claim in March when Trump said at a rally in Texas, “Other countries are emptying out their prisons, insane asylums and mental institutions and sending their most heinous criminals to the United States.” When making the claim, Trump has sometimes cited a news story he says he read, about a doctor at a mental institution in South America who said he no longer has people to take care of because all the patients are being sent to the U.S. We could not find any such story, and immigration experts we talked to said there’s simply no evidence that is happening.\n\n“I cannot prove this is false, but I follow migration in Latin America and the Caribbean quite closely and have never ever heard anything like this related to current migration from the region,” Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told us. “I have never heard any credible claims that any country has been emptying its prisons or mental hospitals so that those released can migrate to the United States.”\n\nPresidential Records Act\n\nThe former president wrongly claimed that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to negotiate with the National Archives and Records Administration for the return of presidential materials he took with him after leaving office. A president can keep personal materials, but not presidential documents.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act says that after a president’s term, the archivist “shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n\nTrump claimed, “We were negotiating with them as per, as per the Presidential Records Act,” adding that “all of the sudden, they raided the house.”\n\n“They didn’t raid the house of Joe Biden,” Trump also said. CNN’s Collins correctly noted: “Joe Biden didn’t ignore a subpoena to get those documents back like you did.”\n\nAs we’ve written, Trump took eight months to comply with NARA’s requests for the return of presidential documents he had at his Mar-a-Lago home. NARA then discovered classified documents among those records. In responding to a subpoena for more classified material, Trump’s lawyers handed over an envelope with 38 classified documents.\n\nTwo months after that, the FBI obtained a court-approved search warrant for Mar-a-Lago and retrieved 13 boxes that contained “over one hundred unique documents with classification markings,” according to a court filing.\n\nBiden Documents at University of Delaware\n\nWhile talking about the Department of Justice’s investigation into his handling of classified documents, Trump repeated a claim that Biden mishandled and hid 1,850 boxes of classified records. “I have every right to [take classified documents] under the Presidential Records,” Trump said. (He doesn’t. See the section above on that act.) “Biden, on the other hand, he has 1,850 boxes.” Later on, Trump claimed that Biden “won’t give back the 1,850 boxes” and that “nobody even knows where they are.”\n\nBut there is no evidence any of the boxes from Biden contain classified information, and their location is known.\n\nAs we’ve written, Biden in 2012 donated more than 1,850 boxes of records from his years in the U.S. Senate to the University of Delaware. The documents are not available for public access following an agreement between Biden and the university at the time of the donation not to provide public access to any of the materials until “two years after the donor [Biden] retires from public life.” In October, a Delaware Superior Court judge upheld the University of Delaware’s refusal to provide access to the documents after the nonprofit Judicial Watch sought them through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe Justice Department, with Biden’s consent, reviewed the documents and did not find any with classified markings, although some were taken for further review, CBS News has reported.\n\n‘Energy Independent’\n\n“We were energy independent” during his administration, Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. never stopped relying on foreign sources of energy under Trump, as his claim suggested. During his presidency, for the first time in decades, the U.S. exported more energy than it imported; produced more energy than it consumed; and again became a net exporter of petroleum, which includes crude oil and refined products from crude oil, such as gasoline and other fuels. Even if “energy independence” was determined by being a net exporter or having more production than consumption, the country’s status has not changed under Biden.\n\nSee “Examining U.S. ‘Energy Independence’ Claims” and “FactChecking Trump’s Presidential Bid Announcement“ for more.\n\nGasoline Prices\n\nTrump falsely claimed that “energy” — a reference to gasoline prices — “went from $1.87 to $5, $6, $7, $8 and even $9.”\n\nThe average price of regular gasoline was $2.38 per gallon the week Trump left office in January 2021, up from a low of $1.77 the final week of April 2020, according to Energy Information Administration figures. Under Biden, the average weekly price reached a record of $5.01 in June 2022. Most recently, the price was down to $3.53 the week of May 8.\n\nThere was at least one California county where gas prices climbed to almost $10 a gallon in June 2022, but the highest average price for all of California — which usually has the country’s most expensive gas — was about $6.44 that month, according to AAA.\n\nAs we have written before, experts have said that U.S. presidents have little influence over gas prices, which are mainly affected by the global price of crude oil, a fossil fuel that is refined into gasoline.\n\nAbortion\n\nTrump claimed that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “They could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born. Now they won’t be able to do that.” As we wrote in 2019 when he made a similar claim, killing a baby is a homicide.\n\nThe 1973 Roe opinion said the government can’t interfere with a right to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Once a fetus is viable outside the womb, the government could restrict or prohibit abortions — but there must be exceptions for the mother’s life and health, which meant both physical and mental health, the court clarified in a companion case.\n\nTrump also said that abortion rights supporters were in favor of abortions very late in a pregnancy or “after the baby is born.” As we wrote recently, in 2021 and 2022, Democrats introduced a bill that, similar to Roe, would set a viability threshold for state restrictions, permitting abortions to be prohibited after viability but with exceptions for risks to the life or health of the mother. The two political parties disagree on what the “health” exception means, with Republicans viewing it as a loophole.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe on June 24, 2022, leaving the issue of regulating abortion to the states.\n\nIn 2020, the vast majority of abortions — 93.1% — in the U.S. occurred in the first trimester, at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Less than 1% were performed at or after 21 weeks. A full-term pregnancy is typically 38 to 42 weeks.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/09/trump-arizona-kari-lake-blake-masters-election-rally/8209439001/', 'Headline': 'Trump in Arizona: Recap from Kari Lake, Blake Masters rally in Mesa', 'Snippet': ""The event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November's election.

The event was streamed on YouTube.\n\nFind related stories:\n\nRally: After a scorching Sunday in Mesa, here are 3 Trump rally takeaways\n\nRepublican candidates rally with Trump: Will it help — or hurt — with voters?\n\nRepublicans for Hobbs: Katie Hobbs gets GOP backing as Trump rallies followers in Mesa\n\nStylistic, policy differences: Kari Lake, Hobbs make back-to-back appearances on national TV\n\nDonald Trump\'s visits to Arizona: Here\'s a list of all 17 times Trump has come to Arizona during his political career\n\nMore coverage by Republic reporters of Trump and the Republican campaign rally in Mesa follows below.\n\n6:55 p.m.: Trump fails to mention 2 Arizona Republicans\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wrapped up his Arizona remarks with endorsements for most, but not all, of the state’s Republican congressional candidates.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump shared the dais with gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters in an effort to boost the top of the ticket.\n\nHe also took turns praising U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:40 p.m.: Trump ends speech in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has concluded his remarks at a rally in Mesa. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots. The Democrats are locking up their political opponents,"" he said.\n\nTrump put himself and his many controversies as the central evidence of Democrats abusing their power to hurt Republican opponents.\n\nHe complained of impeachment over what he again referred to a “perfect phone call” where he tied approval of military aid to Ukraine to that country declaring an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe described his conversation with Georgia election officials that is under criminal investigation “an absolutely perfect phone call.”\n\nWithin seconds of taking the stage, Trump had complained about the media, alluded to his baseless claims of a stolen election and hinted that more elections could lie ahead.\n\n“We won it big and we won it a second time,” Trump said early on.\n\nHe took the stage in sun-splashed Mesa an hour later than scheduled, though those in the crowd of perhaps 5,000 at the event had stuck around without any obvious complaints.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

Many had been galvanized by the Biden administration’s efforts to mandate Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“I will go to my grave unvaccinated,” said Carole Griffith, who drove down with her daughter from Springfield, Ill.\n\nOn the Scene: Trump’s Latest Rally\n\nPeople spontaneously broke out into chants of “Let’s Go Brandon” — a coded insult at Biden that stands in for a four-letter expletive.\n\nThe slogan was everywhere: on shirts, baseball caps, flags.\n\nOn the Scene: Trump’s Latest Rally\n\nThe crowd’s anger extended to a familiar list of opponents – Democrats, the news media, so-called woke culture.\n\nBut it was the pervasiveness of the anti-Biden slogan that was most striking.\n\nOn the Scene: Trump’s Latest Rally\n\nFor some, “Let’s Go Brandon” was a sly way to hurl a profanity without actually saying the offending word.\n\n“As a Christian, I can’t say it,” said Carol White, 75, from San Tan Valley, Ariz. “But this way, I can.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/trump-cnn-town-hall-analysis/index.html', 'Headline': 'Trump was untamed and untruthful in CNN’s town hall – and some of his ...', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump offered America a throwback to past national angst and a possible future of even greater drama in a CNN town hall on Wednesday.', 'Full_text': 'Former President Donald Trump offered America a throwback to past national angst and a possible future of even greater drama in a CNN town hall on Wednesday.\n\nIt’s up to Republicans – and perhaps eventually the country as a whole – to decide whether it wants to go through it all over again.\n\nThe former commander in chief and the frontrunner in the GOP primary showed in New Hampshire exactly why his Republican fans flock to his combativeness and refusal to submit to codes of presidential decorum and why he has had the GOP in his grip for years.\n\nBut in outbursts of election denialism, untamed fury, misogynistic comments about a sexual assault case and by refusing to agree Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, he also showed why many in the GOP fear he could again alienate enough voters to hand the White House to Democrats in 2024.\n\nAnd he gave President Joe Biden an even wider opening to argue the country can’t bear a second Trump presidency.\n\n“I have the absolute right to do whatever I want with them,” Trump said of classified documents he hoarded at his Florida resort when he left office, although he might also have been referring to his wider belief that there should be no constraints on his power if he wins another term.\n\nBut as horrifying as his demagoguery is to many, the reality of Trump’s strong lead in early primary polls is that millions of Republican voters don’t see this even more torqued version of the most disruptive president in American history as disqualifying.\n\nIt is exactly what they want and why they love him. And if he eventually becomes the Republican nominee for the third time in a row, he has a chance to be the next president.\n\n“I like Trump and what he stood for and now, I like him more,” said Joanne Rouston, a former Democrat-turned-Trump voter who was in the audience. “It’s the fight.”\n\nTrump is attempting a comeback like none before. Not only is he seeking to become only the second president to win a non-consecutive term. He’s seeking to bounce back after a double impeachment and an attempt to taint American democracy after he lost his first reelection bid. He took the stage a day after a civil jury in New York found he sexually abused a woman in the 1990s and found him liable for battery and defamation. He was recently indicted in a criminal hush money investigation and pleaded not guilty. And the possibility that he could face more criminal charges for his attacks on democracy and hoarding of classified documents means he is stretching the nation’s legal institutions in an unprecedented way for a presidential candidate.\n\nThe town hall marked pretty much the first time – at least outside a court room or under oath – that Trump was called publicly to account in person for his lies about the 2020 election and role in inciting a mob attack on Congress by his supporters. But he again refused to accept that he lost the last presidential election, despite multiple courts throwing out his challenges and the certifications of his own administration that there was not widespread fraud.\n\nAnd Trump previewed an even more troublesome posture toward America’s democratic values when he said he was inclined to pardon a “large portion” of the rioters who smashed their way into the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and beat up police officers.\n\nThe real start of the 2024 campaign\n\nThe tension and excitement that hung over bucolic Saint Anselm College, as an audience of Republicans and undeclared voters lined up serenaded by a big crowd’s anti-Trump chants, made clear that this was the true kickoff of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nGoing into the event, Trump’s campaign team had signaled that it was not just targeting die-hard “Make America Great Again” voters, but other Republicans and even more moderate voters who were turned off by his behavior in the past but may give him another look.\n\nWhile Trump’s relentless refusal to concede a point and his insistence on his own, often false, version of events is popular among his fans, it’s hard to see how his appearance on Wednesday helped him expand his base of support. His attempt to straddle the abortion issue may have created an even bigger headache for the GOP, which has already suffered electoral consequences in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Trump wanted credit for that decision, which marked a 50-year-long campaign for conservatives. But his waffling answers on what exactly his policy would be in office and whether he’d sign a total ban on the procedure if passed by a Republican Congress showed he knew he was in a political vise.\n\n“I am honored to have done what I did,” Trump said, alluding to his nomination of conservative justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The comment will endear him even more to anti-abortion voters and social conservatives and help ease anxiety among some about his wild personality.\n\n“I think that the number one injustice in our country right now is the ending of unborn life,” said Jason Hennessey, president of New Hampshire Right to Life, after leaving the town hall. “If he is the one who can save the babies … I think that that’s more important than the other stuff.”\n\nBut Democrats are already seizing on the same Trump comment, arguing that the Supreme Court decision, which was out of step with public opinion, hurt Republicans in the midterm elections last year and could help Biden secure a second term in 2024.\n\nAnd Trump’s severe deficit among female voters – whom he lost 57% to 42% in 2020 – is unlikely to have been helped by his sexist descriptions of former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, the plaintiff in the New York defamation and battery civil case, as a “whack job.” And his insult of CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins, who respectfully but perennially fact checked him in real time, as a “nasty person” was another example of his long record of bristling at professional women who stand up to him.\n\nTrump has not changed – he’s more himself\n\nOne of the most remarkable, yet perhaps unsurprising, aspects of Trump’s performance was that after all that happened in 2020, there was no self-reflection or change in his anti-democratic instincts or his insistence against all evidence that the election was “rigged.”\n\nMore broadly, the ex-president proved again that he is an outlier among almost all of his predecessors in that he rejects traditional notions of American democracy, global leadership and a sense that the presidency is greater than anyone who shoulders its duties.\n\nFor instance, he refused to call Putin a “war criminal,” despite the evidence of atrocities committed in his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and warrants issued for his arrest by the International Criminal Court. For Trump, the most important question raised by the conflict is that the United States has sent more aid to Kyiv in defense of democracy than the European Union, which he repeatedly accused of “ripping off” the US in his first term.\n\nHe inaccurately argued, meanwhile, that the Presidential Records Act meant that he could simply take secret documents home after leaving office and they immediately became declassified. Incidentally, several of his answers on legal investigations bearing down upon him might have given his lawyers fresh headaches. But they reinforced the notion that Trump feels that in office, now and potentially in the future, there are no legal or behavioral constraints that should rein him in.\n\nTo many Americans, this attitude is directly contradictory to the values of a nation created in opposition to tyranny and in the name of the rule of law. But again, many Republican voters find this an attractive message and see it as the mark of a leader willing to stand up to what they view as a corrupt liberal establishment overtaken by radical left-wing ideology.\n\nWhile many of Trump’s opponents believe his presidency – marked by endless scandals, chaos and challenges to limits on his power – was a disaster, many of the Republicans in the audience on Wednesday perceived his time in office as one of prosperity and success.\n\n“The best thing about Trump is that he will bring the best minds in the world into one room to get the best consensus,” said Andrew Georgevits, the chairman of the Republican City Committee in Concord, New Hampshire, as he left the town hall. “He brings people together to get the best results and he truly cares about America.”\n\nStill, several of the Republican voters who showed up on Wednesday allowed that they wished Trump could be more disciplined. It’s part of the paradox of his appeal: his wild nature attracts and repels his fans at the same time.\n\nAl Peel came to the town hall hoping to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on helping homeless veterans. But he also wished the ex-president would tone down his behavior.\n\n“If he could keep off his Twitter account and all his fingers off the keyboard – he’d be a lot more popular,” Peel said. “I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results.”\n\nBut while many Republicans believe that Trump’s deliverables make it worth tolerating his outrages, the Biden camp believes that his predecessor’s incorrigible conduct on Wednesday and his obsession with election denialism will again alienate a majority of voters.\n\n“It was quite efficient. Weeks’ worth of damning content in one hour,” one adviser told CNN’s Arlette Saenz, hinting at a gold mine of digital and television advertising to come.\n\nSome critics of CNN’s decision to hold a town hall with Trump complained that the event was simply a platform for his lies and disinformation. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, took this position in a series of tweets.\n\nYet eight years into Trump’s often extreme stranglehold on American politics, it’s clear that his popularity is not simply rooted in an untamed personality that appears mostly concerned about his grievances and agenda. He speaks to something deep inside millions of citizens and thus represents a seam of the national character and attitude toward democracy.\n\nHe’s also leading the Republican race for president. And given the unwillingness of major declared – and yet-to-be-declared GOP rivals – to criticize him, nothing that took place on Wednesday night appeared to change that.\n\nTrump simply isn’t going away.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/10/us/trump-cnn-town-hall', 'Headline': 'Trump CNN Town Hall - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'Trump CNN Town Hall. Trump’s Falsehoods and Bluster Overtake CNN Town Hall. Facing questions from the audience and the moderator, Donald Trump insisted, falsely, that the 2020 election was ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN’s decision to give him an unfiltered prime-time platform was a callback to the 2016 campaign, even as the moderator, Kaitlan Collins, persistently interjected to try to cut him off or correct him.\n\nMr. Trump was so focused on discussing and defending himself that he barely touched on President Biden’s record — which people close to Mr. Trump want him to focus on. But he was disciplined when it came to his chief expected primary rival.\n\nHere are five takeaways.\n\nTrump won’t let go of his lies about 2020 or Jan. 6\n\nIf viewers were expecting Mr. Trump to have moved on from his falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from him, he demonstrated once again, right out of the gate, that he very much hasn’t.\n\nThe first questions asked by Ms. Collins were about Mr. Trump’s refusal to accept his loss in 2020, and his false claims of fraud.\n\n“I think that, when you look at that result and when you look at what happened during that election, unless you’re a very stupid person, you see what happens,” Mr. Trump said, calling the election he lost “rigged.”\n\nMr. Trump later said he was “inclined” to pardon “many” of the rioters arrested on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob during certification of President Biden’s Electoral College win. His avoidance of an unequivocal promise pleased people close to him.\n\nHe also came armed with a list of his own Twitter posts and statements from that day — an idea that was his, a person familiar with the planning said. He lied about his inaction that day as Ms. Collins pressed him about what he was doing during the hours of violence. And he said he did not owe Vice President Mike Pence, whose life was threatened by the mob, an apology.\n\nAs time has worn on, Mr. Trump has increasingly wrapped his arms around what took place at the Capitol and incorporated it into his campaign. Wednesday night was no exception.\n\n“A beautiful day,” he said of Jan. 6.\n\nIt was a reminder that embracing the deadly violence of that day — at least for Republicans — is no longer seen as disqualifying. Privately, Mr. Trump’s team said they were happy with how he handled the extensive time spent on the postelection period during the town hall.\n\nThe G.O.P. audience stacked the deck, but revealed where the base is\n\nThe audience’s regular interruptions on behalf of Mr. Trump were like a laugh track on a sitcom. It built momentum for him in the room — and onscreen for the television audience — and stifled Ms. Collins as she repeatedly tried to interrupt him with facts and correctives.\n\nNo matter how vulgar, profane or politically incorrect Mr. Trump was, the Republican crowd in New Hampshire audibly ate up the shtick of the decades-long showman.\n\nHe would pardon a “large portion” of Jan. 6 rioters. Applause.\n\nHe mocked the detailed accusations of rape from E. Jean Carroll as made up “hanky-panky in a dressing room.” Laughter. No matter that a New York jury held him liable for sexual abuse and defamation this week, awarding Ms. Carroll $5 million in damages.\n\nCalling Ms. Carroll a “wack job.” Applause and laughs.\n\nFlip-flopping on using the debt ceiling for leverage, because “I’m not president.” More laughs.\n\nThe cheers revealed the current psyche of the Republican base, which is eager for confrontation: with the press, with Democrats, with anyone standing in the way of Republicans taking power.\n\nIt made for tough sledding for Ms. Collins, who was like an athlete playing an away game on hostile turf: She had to battle the crowd and the candidate simultaneously.\n\n“You’re a nasty person,” Mr. Trump said to her at one point, echoing the line he used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe town-hall format felt like a set piece for Mr. Trump that he leveraged to cast himself as both the putative Republican incumbent — “Mister president,” he was repeatedly addressed as — and the outsider, recreating conditions from his two previous campaigns.\n\nRepublicans cheered, but so did Democrats looking to the general election\n\nPresident Biden’s team had changed the televisions on Air Force One from CNN to MSNBC as he returned from New York on Wednesday evening. But that didn’t mean his political team was not eagerly watching the town hall unfold, and cheering along with the Republican audience.\n\nMr. Trump defended Jan. 6 as a “beautiful day.” He hailed the overturning of Roe v. Wade as a “great victory.” He wouldn’t say if he hoped Ukraine would win the war against Russia. He talked again about how the rich and famous get their way. “Women let you,” he said. And he refused to rule out reimposing one of the most incendiary and divisive policies of his term in office: purposefully separating families at the border.\n\nMr. Trump’s answers played well in the hall but could all find their way into Democratic messaging in the next 18 months.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Biden campaign was already figuring out what segments could be turned quickly into digital ads, seeing Mr. Trump staking out positions that would turn off the kind of swing voters that Mr. Biden won in 2020.\n\nShortly after the event ended, Mr. Biden issued a tweet. “Do you want four more years of that?” it read. It was a request for donations. It was also a reminder how much of the Biden 2024 campaign is likely to be about Mr. Trump.\n\nTrump aggressively dodged taking a stance on a federal abortion ban\n\nMr. Trump is perhaps the single Republican most responsible for the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year. He appointed three of the court’s justices who powered the majority opinion. But he has privately blamed abortion politics for Republican underperformance in the 2022 midterms and has treaded carefully in the early months of his 2024 run.\n\nBefore the town hall, his team spent considerable time honing his answer to a question they knew he would be asked: Would he support a federal ban, and at how many weeks?\n\nHis repeated dodges and euphemisms were hard to miss on Wednesday.\n\n“Getting rid of Roe v. Wade was an incredible thing for pro-life,” he began.\n\nThat was about as specific as he would get. He said he was “honored to have done what I did” — a line Democrats had quickly flagged as potential fodder for future ads — and that it was a “great victory.”\n\nMr. Trump’s Republican rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis, recently signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida, getting to Mr. Trump’s right on an issue that could resonate with evangelical voters. Mr. Trump did not even mention Mr. DeSantis until more than an hour into the event, and only after prodding from a voter. “I think he ought to relax and take it easy and think about the future,” Mr. Trump urged.\n\nIn refusing to say if he would sign a federal ban, Mr. Trump tried to cast Democrats as radical and pledged that he supported exemptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. “What I’ll do is negotiate so people are happy,” he said.\n\n“I just want to give you one more chance,” Ms. Collins pressed.\n\nHe dodged one final time. “Make a deal that’s going to be good,” he said.\n\nHe deepened his legal jeopardy with comments on investigations\n\nThe most heated exchange that Mr. Trump had with Ms. Collins was over the special counsel investigation into his possession of hundreds of presidential records, including more than 300 individual classified documents, at his private club, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office.\n\nAnd it was the area in which he walked himself into the biggest problems.\n\n“I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,” said Mr. Trump, who has maintained, despite contradictions from his own former officials, that he had a standing order automatically declassifying documents that left the Oval Office and went to the president’s residence.\n\n“I had every right to do it, I didn’t make a secret of it. You know, the boxes were stationed outside the White House, people were taking pictures of it,” Mr. Trump said, intimating that people were somehow aware that presidential material and classified documents were in them (they were not).\n\nIn what will be of great interest to the special counsel, Jack Smith, Mr. Trump would not definitively rule out whether he showed classified material to people, something investigators have queried witnesses about, in particular in connection with a map with sensitive intelligence.\n\n“Not really,” he hedged, adding, “I would have the right to.” At another point he declared, “I have the right to do whatever I want with them.”\n\nHe also defended himself for a call he had with Georgia’s secretary of state in which he said he was trying to “find” enough votes to win. “I didn’t ask him to find anything,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nThere are few issues that worry the Trump team and the former president as much as the documents investigation, and Mr. Trump wore that on his face and in his words on the stage in New Hampshire.'}}",92.75,1

The committee also noted that other Trump calls that day are known, including several to Republican senators to urge them to delay the certification of Biden\'s win.\n\n\'I\'ve seen the impact that his words have on his supporters\'\n\nA major theme from the hearing was how much television the former president consumed as the chaos and violence unfolded.\n\n""President Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff closest advisers and family members begged him to do what is expected of any American president,"" Luria said. ""When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.""\n\nThe committee played video clips of news coverage from Fox News, to show what Trump watched in real time as he tuned in from his dining room, just off from the Oval Office. He watched as his supporters, donning red caps and chanting his name, overwhelmed and outnumbered police as they flooded the Capitol grounds and attempted to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m. ET, just as D.C. police were declaring a riot at the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a video of his speech at the Ellipse earlier that day and did not comment on the violence.\n\nKizinger noted that between 1:49 and 2:24, when Trump posted a subsequent tweet, ""staff repeatedly came into the room to see him and plead that he make a strong public statement condemning the violence and instructing the mob to leave the Capitol.""\n\nThe panel shared video testimony from top advisers and his children imploring Trump to call off the attack.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former White House staffer, has previously testified to a conversation between White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\n""I remember [Cipollone] saying something to the effect of, \'Mark we need to do something more. They\'re literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung.\'\n\nHutchinson recalled Meadow responding: \'You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn\'t think they\'re doing anything wrong.\' ""\n\nTrump eventually relented to calls from his aides and allies and recorded a video in the Rose Garden late that afternoon to tell his supporters to leave the Capitol.\n\nThe committee shared a draft of his remarks, which read: ""I\'m asking for you to leave the Capitol region now and go home in a peaceful way.""\n\nBut in the video, Trump went off script, and didn\'t say those words. Instead, he repeated his false claim that the election was stolen and praised the rioters, saying, ""Go home, we love you.""\n\nThursday\'s witnesses were Trump aides who resigned following Jan. 6\n\nTestifying live Thursday were Matthew Pottinger, Trump\'s deputy national security adviser at the time, and Sarah Matthews, Trump\'s deputy press secretary. The pair resigned following the events of Jan. 6, dismayed by what they deemed an inadequate response from the president at quelling the violence.\n\nMatthews recalled the 2:24 p.m. ET tweet from Trump that read, in part: ""Pence didn\'t have the courage to do what should have been done.""\n\n""I thought that the tweet about the vice president was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the green light to these people telling them that what they were doing at the Capitol and entering the Capitol was OK, that they were justified in their anger,"" said Matthews, who described herself as a ""life-long Republican"".\n\nShe added that as a Trump campaign aide, she had seen the impact his words had on his supporters. ""They truly latch on to every word and every tweet that he says, and so I think that in that moment for him to tweet out the message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire,"" she said.\n\nMatthews said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her ""in a hushed tone"" that Trump ""did not want to include any sort of mention of peace in that tweet.""\n\nShe said McEnany told her ""it took some convincing on their part those who were in the room and she said that there was a back and forth going over different phrases to find something that he was comfortable with, and it wasn\'t until Ivanka Trump suggested the phrase \'stay peaceful\', that he finally agreed to include it.""\n\nPottinger said he was ""disturbed"" by Trump\'s tweet attacking Pence and that it was ""the opposite of what we really needed in that moment which was a de-escalation.""\n\nThe panel described one of Trump\'s final interactions on Jan. 6, as he departed the White House dining room at 6:27 p.m. ET to go to the residence.\n\n""As he was gathering his things in the dining room to leave, President Trump reflected on the day\'s events with an unnamed White House employee,"" Kinzinger said, adding the employee recalled Trump saying: ""Mike Pence let me down.""\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIn his closing statement, Kinzinger said Trump abandoned his responsibilities as commander-in-chief on Jan. 6.\n\n""Whatever your politics, whatever you think about the outcome of the election, we as Americans must all agree on this: Donald Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 was a supreme violation of his oath of office and a complete dereliction of his duty to our nation,"" he said.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome.

The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault.

Specifically, I think about what that mob was there to do: to block the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another based on a lie that the election was rigged and tainted with widespread fraud,” Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., wrote in the foreword of the report.\n\n“The rioters were inside the halls of Congress because the head of the executive branch of our government, the then-President of the United States, told them to attack,” Thompson continued. “Donald Trump summoned that mob to Washington, DC. Afterward, he sent them to the Capitol to try to prevent my colleagues and me from doing our Constitutional duty to certify the election.""\n\n""They put our very democracy to the test,” he added.\n\nThe committee released the 845-page report days after a final committee meeting at which its nine members — seven Democrats and two Republicans — voted to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against Trump as he makes another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\nIt was the first time in history that a congressional committee had made criminal referrals for a U.S. president. The Jan. 6 panel, led by Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., believes there is enough evidence for the Justice Department to prosecute Trump on four specific charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding — Congress’ certification of electoral votes — and inciting or assisting others in an insurrection.\n\nAmong the committee’s nearly dozen recommendations listed at the end of the report: Urging Congress to create a way to evaluate whether Trump and others who took part in the 2020 election plot should be banned from holding future office.\n\nConsistent with the committee’s series of summer hearings and its executive summary, the full report — divided into eight chapters — largely lays blame for the Jan. 6 attack at the feet of the 45th president and downplays security and intelligence failures.\n\nChapter 1 is titled, ""THE BIG LIE,"" a nod to Trump\'s widespread effort to delegitimize the 2020 election and falsely claim it was stolen, while Chapter 2, titled ""I JUST WANT TO FIND 11,780 VOTES,"" focuses on Trump\'s attempt to pressure state and election officials in Georgia and other places to overturn the election results.\n\nWitnesses, nearly all of them Republicans, testified that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Joe Biden’s legitimate election victory; launched a multi-pronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior members of the Justice Department and then-Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election; directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers’ counting of the electoral votes that would certify the results of the election; and refused to call off his supporters as they brutally assaulted police officers and stormed the Capitol.\n\n""Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television. ... No man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again,"" Cheney said at Monday\'s meeting, a line she repeated in her own foreword. ""He is unfit for any office.""\n\nTrump responded overnight with a series of inflammatory posts to his Truth Social network, repeating many of the same false claims about a stolen election and attacking the committee, the FBI and others.\n\n""The Government of the United States changed our Election Result, and it just doesn’t get any worse than that,"" he wrote Friday, falsely claiming that he was the true winner of the 2020 election. ""Just look at the damage that’s been done to our Country, and the World, in the last two years — It’s incalculable. TRUMP WON!!!""\n\nThe committee’s report alleges that Trump and his inner circle conducted at least 200 public or private acts of “outreach, pressure, or condemnation” targeting state and local election officials, as well as state legislators, to overturn the results between Trump’s loss in November and Jan. 6.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, phone calls or texts aimed at state or local officials; 18 public remarks targeting them; and 125 social media posts, the committee says.\n\nThe report also revealed more details about the fake elector plan, which the committee alleges Trump embraced when it became clear that state officials in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and other key battlegrounds would not overturn the results in their states and replace Biden electors with Trump electors.\n\nWhile the committee referred conservative attorney John Eastman to the Justice Department on Monday for his role in the scheme to pressure Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6, the report identifies Trump-allied lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as central to conceptualizing the plot.\n\nSome of the committee\'s conclusions appear in the report\'s appendices. For example, previous reporting and Jan. 6 hearings had revealed that Pentagon bureaucrats, including Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt and Gen. Charles Flynn, had delayed sending National Guard troops as police were overwhelmed by the rioters.\n\nBut the committee found that there was no deliberate attempt to stall the troops: “While the delay seems unnecessary and unacceptable, it was the byproduct of military processes, institutional caution, and a revised deployment approval process,"" the committee writes in Appendix 2.\n\n""We have no evidence that the delay was intentional.”\n\nAs it was tasked to do, the committee also issued a number of recommendations to both Congress and federal agencies. The panel urged congressional committees to consider creating a “formal mechanism” to determine whether to bar Trump and others identified in the report from holding future federal or state office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which targets those who have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee also called for reforms to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to make it clear that the vice president does not have the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes, an update that is already in the works. Congress will pass such a recommendation this week as part of its omnibus spending package.\n\nIn addition, the Jan. 6 committee recommended that federal agencies undertake a “whole of government strategy” to root out and combat violent extremism, including white nationalists. And it urged law enforcement to designate future certifications of presidential elections as a “national special security event.” That would require greater planning, coordination and security for future Jan. 6 certification events at the Capitol.\n\n""Driven by our investigative findings, these recommendations will help strengthen the guardrails of our democracy,"" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe report marks the culmination of a sweeping congressional investigation that included 11 public hearings, more than 100 subpoenas, more than 1,200 witness interviews and the collection of hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails and other documents.\n\nThe committee has already begun releasing dozens of transcripts from witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights, including Trump associates Eastman, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and Jeffrey Clark.\n\nOn Thursday, the Jan. 6 panel released transcripts of the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who had testified that Trump was aware the mob was armed when he sent it to the Capitol and that he had tried to join his supporters there.\n\nIn the coming days, the committee also plans to release other transcripts from interviews and depositions, as well as video and other documents and records.\n\nBecause House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., created it as a ""select"" committee, the panel expires at the end of the year. Republicans, who will take control of the House in January, have no plans to renew it.\n\nAt her final news conference as speaker Thursday, Pelosi praised Thompson, Cheney and the other Jan. 6 members for their ""persistent, patriotic leadership.""\n\n""The 117th Congress began with a violent assault on our democracy, and now we hear its conclusions,"" she said.

While the referrals do not compel federal prosecutors to take any action, they sent a powerful signal that a select committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\n“Our institutions are only strong when those who hold office are faithful to our Constitution,” Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman of the committee, wrote in the report, adding: “Part of the tragedy of Jan. 6 is the conduct of those who knew that what happened was profoundly wrong, but nevertheless tried to downplay it, minimize it or defend those responsible.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) ...', 'Full_text': '1. ‘Potus im sure is loving this’: Mid-riot text adds to suggestions of Trump’s approval\n\nThe committee has focused extensively on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction as the riot was taking place. But it has occasionally suggested that he might have approved of what was happening or at least seen some political upside in it.\n\nAnd the final report contains more grist for that mill: One of the most striking new revelations is a text message from a Trump aide, Robert Gabriel. At 2:49 p.m., as the Capitol was under siege, Gabriel texted, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\nThe text builds upon previously known evidence.\n\nShortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during the riot, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nWhite House aide Sarah Matthews has said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her that Trump resisted calling on the rioters to be “peaceful” in a tweet. (In texts from the time and in later testimony to the committee, Trump aide Hope Hicks also said that, before Jan. 6, both she and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann called for Trump to preemptively urge peacefulness, but that Trump “refused.”)\n\nWhite House aide Cassidy Hutchinson has also testified that, amid a frantic effort to get Trump to act, she overheard chief of staff Mark Meadows telling White House counsel Pat Cipollone, “He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat.”\n\nThe committee pressed Cipollone on whether Trump actually wanted people to leave the Capitol. Cipollone had said he couldn’t think of anyone on staff who didn’t want the rioters to leave. But when asked whether Trump shared in that opinion, Cipollone struggled with the question and ultimately punted, saying he couldn’t “reveal communications” with Trump, citing executive privilege.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. New details on the ‘fake elector’ plot\n\nOne of the committee’s criminal referrals hones in on the effort to appoint alternate Trump electors (also known as “fake electors”) in key states. And a key question has been: What was the intent behind their appointment?\n\nThe Trump campaign pitched these electors as just a contingency — i.e., they needed to be in place by the Dec. 14 deadline, just in case a given state changed course and declared Trump the winner of their electoral votes. But there has been evidence that some of the architects of the plot planned to deploy the electors regardless, in a much more desperate and forceful ploy to overturn legitimate election results.\n\nSome of the fake electors were apparently concerned about the strategy, or even saw something unsavory ahead. In newly revealed evidence, Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt texted his party’s executive director in late November and said, “I hope they are not planning on asking us to do anything like try and say we are only the proper electors.” He added on Dec. 12 after receiving a message about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: “These guys are up to no good and its gonna fail miserably.” Hitt signed on as a Trump elector anyway.\n\nOther electors clearly worried about legal liability, insisting (in New Mexico and Pennsylvania) that the documents listing them specify that they were only legitimate if their states’ election results were overturned. But most documents made no such distinction.\n\nThe committee also detailed new evidence linking Giuliani, Trump and Meadows to the early fake-elector effort. Trump campaign lawyer Joshua Findlay testified that “it was my understanding that the President made” the decision to have someone look into the feasibility of appointing alternative electors around Dec. 7 or 8.\n\n3. Some notable recommendations — including on 14th Amendment\n\nOn Monday, the committee took the historic step of referring Trump and others to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But the report features some other recommendations, including one that had been floated after Jan. 6: possibly disqualifying Trump and others from holding office.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution says that anyone who has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States can be barred from holding office. (This law has been invoked in unsuccessful efforts to bar some GOP lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from office.)\n\nTrump’s second impeachment featured a historic number of members of the president’s own party voting in favor. And some Democrats and watchdogs continue to argue for Trump to be barred from office. But with Republicans taking over the House in early January — and even Democrats generally having shown little appetite for this step before — it appears unlikely Congress will take up this proposal.\n\nThe report also advises that congressional committees look into media and social media companies whose policies have “have had the effect of radicalizing their consumers, including by provoking people to attack their own country.” And it recommends possible safeguards against a president misusing the Insurrection Act, which some Trump allies floated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It suggests Trump defamed Dominion\n\nSome have questioned why, though Fox News and others have found themselves under legal scrutiny, Trump himself isn’t the focus of high-profile lawsuits aimed at those who spread lies and misinformation about voting machines. (Legal experts disagree on the strength of the potential legal case a plaintiff would have against him.)\n\nThe report lays out how Trump was repeatedly told what he was saying about Dominion voting machines was false, even as he continued to spout the claims. And it suggests Trump meets the test for defaming Dominion.\n\n“President Trump’s own campaign staff, administration officials, and State officials, all told him the claims had no merit. Hand recounts confirmed the fidelity of the machines,"" the report says. ""But none of this overwhelming evidence mattered. President Trump demonstrated a conscious disregard for the facts and continued to maliciously smear Dominion.”\n\nThe language here is deliberate: Legally speaking, the “actual malice” standard for defamation requires proving that the person either knew what they were saying was false or showed a reckless disregard for whether it were true.\n\nThe report highlights previously known evidence about the various advisors and government officials who either tried to dissuade Trump from this theory, or knew that others had. It also added a new name this week: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who confirmed she had tried unsuccessfully to wave Trump off the theory.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, White House press aide Sarah Matthews also testified that McEnany “actively” resisted Trump’s attempts to get her to bring up the conspiracy theory in media interviews and hold White House briefings on the subject.\n\n5. The extent of Trump’s pressure campaign in key states\n\nWe’ve known that Trump and his allies pressured lawmakers and officials far and wide to help overturn the election results in key states. But the report lays out the vast scale of this effort.\n\nIt says, “President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.”\n\nWhat qualifies as “targeting” an official is, of course, subjective. But several officials indicate they felt the pressure.\n\nThen-Michigan state House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said he received between five and 10 phone calls from Trump after the election. Chatfield said he repeatedly informed Trump he had seen nothing that would overturn Trump’s nearly three-point deficit in the state, and he and state Senate President Mike Shirkey (R) put out a statement saying as much after a meeting with Trump.\n\nBut the Trump campaign on Jan. 3 tweeted that people should contact Chatfield or the GOP leader of the state Senate, Mike Shirkey, to “Demand [a] vote on decertification."" Trump’s social media team promoted Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey said he received 4,000 text messages. Chatfield testified, ""I and my family have received numerous threats, along with members on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe report details dozens of officials who were threatened, though not all were targeted by Trump personally. The chairman of the Maricopa County, Ariz., board of supervisors, Clint Hickman (R), said “the threats never abated.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Little focus on security issues, while mostly blaming Trump\n\nThe Washington Post reported in November that some committee members and staffers on the Jan. 6 committee were upset that Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wanted the report to focus so extensively on Trump. Well, the final product appears to reflect Cheney’s desires.\n\nThe report says relatively little about the security failures that had been the focus of some congressional probing. It mostly relegates those findings to the first appendix — about 30 pages long — near the end of the report. For example, it does little to reconcile conflicting timelines presented by key officials when it comes to when the National Guard was requested and approved.\n\nBut the verdict is rather damning, saying these failures also put lives in danger.\n\nThe report says that, before Jan. 6, both federal and local law enforcement had intelligence predicting violence that day. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.” the report says. “The failure to sufficiently share and act upon that intelligence jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\nIn the next breath, though, the report emphasizes Trump’s culpability and says that better planning might not have been able to account for the violence he would stoke.\n\n7. The full picture of an allegedly corrupt plot\n\nThe chief alleged crime the committee has focused on is what’s known as obstruction of an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’s counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. And showing that requires proving Trump acted corruptly.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth running through all the evidence — most of it previously established, but some new — that this plot was corrupt. The committee has keyed on a few things: that Trump was told his voter-fraud theories were false, that he actually knew he had lost the 2020 election, and that the participants in the plot knew it was illegal.\n\nIn addition to the previously-known figures who said they pushed back on Trump’s theories internally, the committee revealed this week that White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien testified about a Dec. 18 Oval Office phone call in which he said that there was no evidence of fraud using voting machines or foreign interference. Cipollone also testified that the lack of sufficient evidence was made clear internally “over and over again.”\n\nIncluding an official in Raffensperger’s office, the report details at least eight officials testifying that Trump and his team were informed his theories were false.\n\nAs for Trump admitting he lost: Hutchinson and another former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin have both said they heard about Trump doing so. And in a transcript released this week, Hutchinson said she asked Meadows, point blank, whether Trump knew he lost. According to Hutchinson, Meadows “said something to the effect of, ‘he knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There’s a chance he didn’t lose. I want to pull this off for him.”\n\nPrevious evidence also showed some of those involved admitted their plot was illegal or might not pass legal muster. That includes contemporaneous documents from Eastman, and testimony from Pence aide Greg Jacob and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann about their interactions with Eastman, and Giuliani, respectively, who they said admitted their case would lose in court. And in October, a judge ruled that Trump had knowingly signed a verification containing false voter-fraud figures that Eastman had admitted were wrong.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. What the report doesn’t shed light on\n\nThe scale of the investigation was massive, and many witnesses weren’t particularly forthcoming, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or, in some cases, not testifying at all. That means that some of the angles probed by the committee remain unresolved or disputed. Among them:\n\n- The committee didn’t resolve what happened in the presidential vehicle after Trump’s speech. Hutchinson had testified that White House aide Anthony M. Ornato told her that Trump became irate and lunged at the head of his Secret Service detail, Bobby Engel, when Engel wouldn’t bring him to the Capitol. (She emphasized that her account was secondhand.) Ornato said he didn’t recall conveying that information to Hutchinson, according to the committee. The committee confirmed with other witnesses that Trump was angry, but they did not confirm a physical altercation. In the end, the report says it was “difficult to fully reconcile the accounts of several of the witnesses who provided information with what we heard from Engel and Ornato.”\n\n- Some congressional Democrats suggested shortly after Jan. 6 that certain Republicans provided reconnaissance tours to rioters before Jan. 6. And more specifically, the committee raised questions about a tour Rep. Barry Loudermilk(R-Ga.) led on Jan. 5, which Loudermilk struggled to explain. But the report doesn’t dwell upon this at all. It merely mentions that one of Loudermilk’s guests who was captured on video at Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 “took pictures of hallways and staircases,” which was previously known.\n\n- Hutchinson testified that Trump was told people at his speech were found with weapons but was unconcerned — and even asked that security stop using magnetometers. This is a key piece of evidence, since Trump would later direct these people to the Capitol. Hutchinson said Trump justified his lack of concern by saying, “They’re not here to hurt me.” The report doesn’t confirm that Trump was told about the weapons, but it does say Engel recalled Trump making a similar comment, as Trump was trying to persuade Engel to take him to the Capitol.\n\ncorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated that it had been more than a century since the 14th Amendment was used to bar someone from public office. In September, a New Mexico judge used it to disqualify an Otero County commissioner.

The latest release comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress.\n\nSo far, the released transcripts have provided illuminating insights into the final weeks of former President Donald Trump’s presidency, with accounts from inside the Trump White House, from federal and state officials who resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election results, and many others.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Thursday’s disclosures:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. explains why he texted Meadows on November 5 about plans to keep his father in office\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee that the reason he texted Meadows a detailed plan about how to ensure his father would get a second term two days after the 2020 presidential election was because he thought the ideas were “the most sophisticated” and “sounded plausible.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s testimony, revealed by the select committee on Thursday, provides new context to a text message CNN first reported on in April where he lays out various ideas for keeping Trump in power by subverting the Electoral College process.\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6, 2021.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said that he was not the original author of the text, a point his lawyer made to CNN back in April, and that he did not remember who the original author of the message was, he explained to investigators why out of all the messages he was being sent at the time, he felt this one was necessary to pass on to Meadows.\n\n“Perhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don’t necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nMeadows did not initially respond to the original November 5 text, but when Trump Jr. followed up the next day to make sure he saw, Trump’s then-chief of staff texted, “much of this had merit. Working on this for PA, so Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina already.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., fiancée don’t recall details and distance themselves from events that led to January 6, transcripts show\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee he couldn’t recall key details related to his appearance at a rally that preceded the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump Jr. said he didn’t know Turning Point Action paid him and his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle $30,000 each for their appearances at the rally on the White House ellipse. He said he thought the money was for an event at the Palm Beach Hilton in December, according to a transcript released Thursday.\n\n“My recollection was that we had spoken for them prior to Christmas at an event that we did annually and always got sort of paid for speaking fees to show up,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nIn transcripts of their interviews with the House select committee, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle repeatedly said they didn’t recall details and distanced themselves from the events that led to the January 6 attack. Trump Jr. told committee investigators, “I don’t recall specifically,” when asked if he ever received the $30,000 and “I don’t know,” when asked if Guilfoyle ever ended up getting paid.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle said they didn’t remember specific conversations about rally planning and that they were in the dark about the particulars as it was being put together.\n\nGuilfoyle also denied having conversations with anyone linking the rally to objections to Congress certifying Joe Biden’s electoral win.\n\n“I was not involved in any of that certification stuff. I couldn’t explain it to you to this day,” she said, adding that she didn’t know the significance of holding the rally on January 6.\n\n‘Just give me five dead voters’: Sen. Lindsey Graham said after 2020 election, Trump lawyer tells committee\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Sen. Lindsey Graham pledged to become a “champion” of then-President Trump’s election fraud claims – if only Trump’s advisers would give him information about dead voters, according to an account given to the January 6 committee.\n\n“Senator Graham was saying, ‘Get me your information,’” Trump lawyer Christina Bobb relayed to the committee about what Graham said in a meeting days before the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n“Just give me five dead voters,” Bobb said Graham told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others in Meadows’ office at the White House.\n\n“Give me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion,” Bobb added, relaying what Graham said at the time.\n\nThe exchange with Graham highlights how the South Carolina Republican became involved in Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn his election loss in Georgia, and how the White House at the time was connecting with influential politicians to advance Trump’s message of false election fraud claims.\n\n“Graham was like, ‘Oh, I’d love to support the cause. I think it would be great to, you know, really show all the fraud. Send me a memo and show me, you know, what information you have got. I’ll champion it,’” Bobb also recalled from the conversation with Graham.\n\nAccording to a transcript of Bobb’s House testimony released Thursday, Graham received a memo from the legal team working with Trump, titled “Chairman Graham dead votes memo for your consideration.”\n\nBut Bobb added: “He did nothing with it.”\n\nGraham’s office pointed out on Thursday that the book “Peril” by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa previously described a similar exchange between Graham and the Trump advisers. After receiving their memo, the senator was unconvinced of the fraud they claimed, the book said. His office didn’t provide any further response.\n\nGrisham says she learned Trump thought rioters ‘looked very trashy’ but loved that they were ‘fighting for him’\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, said she learned from people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, that Trump thought the rioters “looked very trashy,” but reveled in how they were “fighting for him.”\n\nGrisham told the committee: “I heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments – some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were.”\n\n“He was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn’t like how they looked,” Grisham said.\n\nMelania Trump didn’t trust her husband’s inner circle, the former first lady’s chief of staff says\n\nGrisham also detailed the former first lady’s distrust in people close to her husband after the 2020 election, including Donald Trump Jr.\n\n“Certainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of their – of Don Jr.’s father,” Grisham told the committee.\n\nGrisham said Melania also distrusted “people that she thought were giving her husband bad advice,” like lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and campaign staffers. “She would say, I think they’re giving him bad advice, I don’t think this is smart.”\n\nFormer Trump acting defense secretary endorsed giving DC mayor more control of DC National Guard\n\nChris Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told the committee he thought the Washington, DC, mayor should have greater control of the DC National Guard in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nMiller was asked in his January deposition about a proposal in Congress to give the Washington, DC, mayor the same authority to deploy the National Guard that a governor has. Because the District of Columbia is not a state, the authority to deploy is delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary and president.\n\nMiller said of the DC mayor being given more authority over the Guard: “Being a private citizen, I’ll tell you exactly what I think, and take it or leave. Heck, yeah.”\n\n“The mayor should absolutely have greater control over the DC National Guard,” he continued, according to a transcript released by the panel Thursday. “I do not know the history. And I’m sure there’s all sorts of reasons that are constitutional, way beyond what I understand, so I’m just kind of popping off, but there’s got to be a way to integrate her or the mayor into this process of work meaningfully and more proactively.”\n\nMiller testified to the committee about the lag in getting National Guard soldiers to the Capitol on January 6, saying that he didn’t know why Major Gen. William Walker, the DC National Guard Commander, believed he didn’t have approval to deploy. According to the January 6 committee’s report, Walker “understood he had to wait for approval from Secretary (Ryan) McCarthy to deploy his forces. But as he waited on that video call for hours, he did strongly consider sending them anyway.”'}}",99.16666666666667,1

(Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his ...', 'Full_text': ""On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene walks into the seventh-floor congressional office belonging to Representative Matt Gaetz, settles into a high-backed black leather chair, and fits a pair of headphones over her blonde hair. The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-green-flees-protest/', 'Headline': 'Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene quickly flees NYC protest after being ...', 'Snippet': 'Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day.', 'Full_text': 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-tweets-testimony/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene to Jan. 6: I Don’t Know Her - VICE', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. ...

That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-protests-new-york-city-arraignment-president-indictment/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene joins protests in New York City, chants with ...', 'Snippet': 'GOP Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene showed up at a protest across the street from the Manhattan criminal court where former President Donald Trump was being arraigned on Tuesday. The Georgia Republican spoke to a crowd through a megaphone and was met with both supporters and opponents.\n\nThe crowd was relatively small but swarmed Greene in the park across from the courthouse. She spoke briefly, calling Trump the ""top Republican candidate for president for 2024,"" and saying, ""We cannot tolerate this injustice in the United States of America. No more.""\n\nAs she condemned the actions of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who indicted Trump last week, and Democrats, the crowd got louder and louder, with some blowing whistles.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Posted on January 6, 2022. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of months of false claims about election fraud, including a litany recited by then-President Donald ...', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/15/january-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol-security-ac360-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': 'New video shows Pelosi and Schumer talking with Army official on January 6', 'Snippet': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify ...', 'Full_text': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/jan-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol.html', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 Video Shows Pelosi and Schumer Scrambling to Secure the ...', 'Snippet': 'Chilling Footage Shows Congressional Leaders on Jan. 6.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “I don't know if you had been approached about the Virginia National Guard … but I still think you probably need the OK of the federal government in order to come into another jurisdiction.\n\n“Oh, my God, they're just breaking windows or doing all kinds of — it's really that somebody, they said somebody was shot,” she continued. “It's just horrendous, and all at the instigation of the president of the United States.”\n\nSchumer urged Rosen to get Trump to put out a statement calling off the mob.\n\n“Why don't you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility?” Schumer asked. “A public statement that they should all leave.”\n\n“They're breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that. That's nothing,” Pelosi explained. “The concern we have about personal safety just transcends everything.”\n\nLater in the video, Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell, as well as Reps. Steve Scalise and Steny Hoyer and Sen. John Thune, are seen huddled together on a call to the Department of Defense, pleading for troops to be sent in.\n\n“We need them there now, whoever you got,” Schumer said.\n\n“Just pretend for a moment that it were the Pentagon or the White House or some other entity that was under siege,” Pelosi said. “Let me say you can logistically get people there as you make the plan.”\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex — not just Democrats,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said while introducing the footage. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing — what he simply refused to do.”""}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/new-jan-6-footage-shows-pelosi-leaders-as-crisis-unfolded-1.6108445', 'Headline': 'New Jan. 6 footage shows Pelosi, leaders as crisis unfolded', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON -.

Startled, Pelosi asked the woman to repeat what she said.\n\n""Do you believe this?"" Pelosi said in disbelief to another Democratic leader, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nIt was around 2:45 p.m. and the violent cacophony had already disrupted the planned certification of the 2020 presidential election results. It would be hours before the building was secure.\n\nNever-before-seen video footage played Thursday by the House Jan. 6 committee showed Pelosi and other leaders, including Republican allies of President Donald Trump, responding anxiously -- and angrily -- to the insurrection.\n\nThe recordings offer a rare glimpse into the real-time reactions of the most powerful members of Congress as they scrambled to drum up support from all parts of the government, including from agencies seemingly ill prepared for the chaos, and vented anger over a president whose conduct they felt had endangered their lives.\n\nIn the videos, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiate with governors and defense officials to try to get the National Guard to the Capitol as police were being brutally beaten outside the building.\n\nThe deployment of the Guard was delayed for hours as Trump stood by and did little to stop the violence of his supporters.\n\nThe footage, recorded by Pelosi\'s daughter, Alexandra, a documentary filmmaker, was shown during the committee\'s 10th hearing as an illustration of the president\'s inaction in the face of grave danger posed by the rioters to the lawmakers forced into hiding inside.\n\n""As the president watched the bloody attack unfold on Fox News from his dining room, members of Congress and other government officials stepped into the gigantic leadership void created by the president\'s chilling and steady passivity that day,"" said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a committee member.\n\nThe concerns were not theoretical. Around 3 p.m., as a Trump loyalist outside Pelosi\'s office pointed her finger and shouted, ""We\'re coming in if you don\'t bring her out,"" the speaker was huddled somewhere else in a room with Schumer, who said, ""I\'m gonna call up the effin\' secretary of DoD.""\n\nAnd so he did, telling acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller on speakerphone that there were senators still in hideaway spaces and imploring him to send in the Maryland National Guard. Pelosi chimed in that she was going to call the mayor of Washington, D.C., for help as well.\n\nAs the violence persisted outside -- ""Officer down, get him up,"" a voice could be heard bellowing in one clip shown by the committee -- the leaders kept making calls inside. One went to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam about the possibility of help from the Virginia National Guard, with Pelosi narrating the events based on what she saw from television news footage.\n\nAn angrier call followed with Jeffrey Rosen, the then-acting attorney general. Days earlier, and unbeknownst at the time to Congress or to the public, Rosen and colleagues had fended off a slapdash attempt by Trump to replace him with a subordinate eager to challenge the election results.\n\nOn that day, though, Schumer and Pelosi sat shoulder-to-shoulder on the couch and laid bare their frustrations with the country\'s top law enforcement official.\n\n""They\'re breaking the law in many different ways,"" Pelosi said. ""And quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the president of the United States.""\n\nSchumer weighed in too, shaking his head to the side for emphasis: ""Yeah, why don\'t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility? A public statement they should all leave.""\n\nIt wasn\'t until the evening that the Capitol would be cleared and work would resume. The news that Congress would be able to reconvene to finish its work in certifying the election results was delivered to the congressional leaders not by Trump but by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAfter a very bad day, Schumer had two words: ""Good news.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/new-video-clips-january-6-attack/index.html', 'Headline': 'Watch: Key moments from new January 6 video | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seen in the new footage from January 6. 2021.

The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the new footage:\n\nSchumer pleads with acting AG to ask Trump to call off rioters\n\nThis clip shows a tense conversation between then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen where Schumer asks Rosen to tell Trump to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol.\n\n“Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol?,” Schumer says. Rosen sidesteps the question, saying instead, “So, uh, as you might guess we’re coordinating as quickly and as” – at which point Schumer jumps in to say, “no, no, no, please answer my question,” before shouting, “answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\nAt the start of the clip, Schumer can be seent shouting at the then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\n“DC has requested the National Guard and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer says. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged … We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nSchumer then hangs up the phone and tells Pelosi who is sitting nearby, “They have not denied it. I spoke to the Secretary of the Army. He’s given the full OK to (inaudible) the National Guard. He said it was not denied.”\n\nPelosi talks about punching Trump\n\nPelosi can be seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nLater, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying “we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden’s win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building. Pence gives Pelosi and Schumer a heads up that law enforcement officials believe the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in “roughly an hour.”\n\nThe video demonstrates how Pence worked to relay information to congressional leaders on the day of the attack. When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, “Good news!”\n\n“They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they’re confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that’s helpful,” Pence says. Pelosi thanks him afterward.\n\nThis clip shows in lengthy detail how the situation at the Capitol escalated on January 6 with rioters swarming the building and eventually breaching it. It shows rioters screaming obscenities directed at a variety of people including law enforcement officers, Pelosi and Pence.\n\nLater Pelosi is seen sheltering with Schumer and other congressional leaders. They pass a phone around with photos of the scene unfolding at the Capitol. “Oh my God. They broke into the Senate chamber,” Schumer says.\n\nA television is turned on showing footage of the attack. “Oh my God, they’re just breaking windows,” Pelosi says, reacting to what she sees on the screen. “It’s just horrendous. All at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nLater, a group of bipartisan congressional leaders huddle around a phone to speak with Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has message of urgency for Miller, saying, “we’re in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\nMiller responds that he got the message, “loud and clear.”\n\nPelosi is later seen speaking with Pence on the phone. She asks him how he’s doing and expresses concern for his safety. “Don’t let anybody know where you are,” she warns.\n\nPelosi, Pence discuss personal safety, contingency plans\n\nPerhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET.

Ralph Northam in which she wondered if he could deploy his state\'s National Guard troops to the Capitol. She told Northam that House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was making the same request of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Schumer and Pelosi were also seen on the phone with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen asking for him to get President Donald Trump to call off his supporters.\n\n""Why don’t you get the president to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility — a public statement they should all leave?"" Schumer said.\n\nOne of the central questions lingering after the attack was why it took so long for National Guard troops to provide the overwhelmed Capitol Police officers with backup. Trump and his allies have repeatedly blamed Pelosi, with Trump telling The Washington Post in April, ""I thought it was a shame, and I kept asking why isn’t she doing something about it? Why isn’t Nancy Pelosi doing something about it? And the mayor of D.C. also. The mayor of D.C. and Nancy Pelosi are in charge.""\n\nThe video from Thursday\'s hearing shows Pelosi and other congressional leaders repeatedly asking for help from law enforcement.\n\nEventually, the video showed Pelosi and Schumer in a room with GOP congressional leaders at the time: Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then the majority leader; House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.; and Senate GOP Whip John Thune, R-S.D.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate Democratic whip, appeared in another clip with leaders.\n\nAt 4:22 p.m., Pelosi was on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who was in a separate secure location. She told Pence that they had spoken to McConnell about expediting the process of certifying the 2020 electoral votes.\n\n""What we are being told very directly is it’s going to take days for the Capitol to be OK again,"" Pelosi told Pence.

For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}}",96.42857142857143,1

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Wednesday, March 15, 2023. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control groups that ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?""\n\nGaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah.""\n\nGaetz\'s comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you.""\n\nIn June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim.\n\nHere’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.\n\nThe IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail.\n\nThe division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978.\n\nSpecial agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published.\n\nThe numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago.""\n\nSpecial agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition.\n\nThe IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619).\n\nAccording to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data.\n\nThe report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\n\nThe report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available.\n\nThe IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.\n\nGaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.\n\nBiden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year.\n\nBut there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades.\n\nThe $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'In 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'Reporting from Washington.

It will also require enhanced background checks for people ages 18 to 21 and funding for youth mental health services.\n\nThe bipartisan gun legislation sped through Congress in the month after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. Democrats unanimously voted in favor of the bill along with more than two dozen Republicans in the House and the Senate, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n""When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,"" Biden said. ""If we can reach a compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans health care to cutting-edge American innovation to so much more.""\n\nHe had pleaded with lawmakers to pass legislation tightening gun laws following the shootings in Buffalo, New York, and in Uvalde. But the bill stopped short of his call for Congress to ban assault weapons and to require background checks for all gun purchases, both of which are widely opposed by Republicans in Congress.\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” Biden said. “God bless us with the strength to get the work left done.”\n\nThe bill gives Biden a win following two major blows from the Supreme Court over the past week. The court ruled Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating a woman\'s constitutional right to an abortion. And on Thursday, it struck down a New York law that required showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.\n\n“I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions,” Biden said when asked about those rulings by a reporter.\n\nBiden signed the gun legislation moments before heading to Europe for a week of meetings with Group of Seven leaders in Germany and with NATO leaders in Spain. When he returns, he said, he plans to have an event at the White House with the lawmakers who helped pass the bill.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-25/emboldened-biden-dems-push-ban-on-so-called-assault-weapons', 'Headline': 'Emboldened Biden and Democrats push to revive the assault weapons ban', 'Snippet': 'Nov. 25, 2022 2:52 PM PT.

He reiterated that call this ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Biden speaks about the “scourge” of gun violence, his focus returns to reviving a ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe reiterated that call this week after shootings in Colorado and Virginia: Biden wants to sign into law a renewed ban on high-powered guns that have the capacity to kill many people very quickly.\n\n“The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick,” Biden said on Thanksgiving Day. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.”\n\nAfter the mass killing last Saturday at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, he said in a statement: “When will we decide we’ve had enough? ... We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”\n\nWhen Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading. By comparison, New York Police Department officers carry a handgun that shoots about half that much.\n\nA weapons ban is far off in a closely divided Congress. But Biden and the Democrats have become increasingly emboldened in pushing for stronger gun controls — and doing so with no clear electoral consequences.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed legislation in July to revive a 1990s-era ban on assault weapons, with Biden’s vocal support. And the president pushed a ban nearly everywhere that he campaigned this year.\n\nIn the midterm elections, Democrats kept control of the Senate and Republicans were able to claim a House majority by a narrower margin than they had expected.\n\nThe tough talk follows passage in June of a landmark bipartisan bill on gun laws, and it reflects steady progress that gun control advocates have been making in recent years.\n\n“I think the American public has been waiting for this message,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been the Senate’s leading advocate for stronger gun restrictions since the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. “There has been a thirst from voters, especially swing voters, young voters, parents, to hear candidates talk about gun violence, and I think Democrats are finally sort of catching up with where the public has been.”\n\nJust over half of voters want to see nationwide gun policy made more strict, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide conducted for the Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About 3 in 10 want gun policy kept as is, and 14% prefer looser gun laws.\n\nThere are clear partisan divides. About 9 in 10 Democrats want stricter gun laws, compared with about 3 in 10 Republicans. About half of Republicans want gun laws left as they are, and one-quarter want to see gun laws be made less strict.\n\nOnce banned in the United States, the high-powered firearms are now the weapon of choice among young men responsible for many of the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later, unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban.\n\nWhen he was governor of Florida, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott signed gun control laws in the wake of mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he has consistently opposed weapons bans, arguing like many of his Republican colleagues that most gun owners use them lawfully.\n\n“People are doing the right thing; why would we take away their weapons?” Scott asked as the Senate was negotiating gun legislation last summer. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nHe said more mental health counseling, assessments of troubled students and law enforcement on campus make more sense.\n\n“Let’s focus on things that actually would change something,” Scott said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long called for stricter gun laws, arguing that the availability of these weapons makes people less safe and makes their jobs more dangerous.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore, who heads the country’s third-largest police department, said it just makes sense to talk about restricting firearms when gun violence is rising nationwide, and consider what the government can do to make the streets safer. He said he is grateful Biden is bringing it up so much.\n\n“This isn’t a one-and-done,” Moore said of the shooting last weekend at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. “These things are evolving all the time, in other cities, at any moment another incident happens. It’s crying out for the federal government, for our legislators, to go out and make this change,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, six people were shot dead at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Over the last six months there has been a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., a massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas, and the Fourth of July parade killing of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.\n\nThe legislation that Biden signed in June will, among other things, help states put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged to be dangerous.\n\nBut a ban was never on the table.\n\nA 60-vote threshold in the Senate means some Republicans must be on board. Most are steadfastly opposed, arguing it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\n“I’d rather not try to define a whole group of guns as being no longer available to the American public,” Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said. “For those of us who have grown up with guns as part of our culture, and we use them as tools — there’s millions of us, there’s hundreds of millions of us — that use them lawfully.”\n\nIn many states where the bans have been enacted, the restrictions are being challenged in court, gaining strength from a Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights.\n\n“We feel pretty confident, even despite the arguments made by the other side, that history and tradition as well as the text of the 2nd Amendment are on our side,” said David Warrington, chairman and general counsel for the National Foundation for Gun Rights.\n\nBiden was instrumental in helping secure the 1990s ban as a senator. The White House has noted statistics showing that while it was in place, mass shootings declined, and when it expired in 2004, shootings tripled.\n\nThe reality is complicated. The data on the effectiveness is mixed and there is a sense that other measures that are not as politically fraught might actually be more effective, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.”\n\nPolitically, the ban sparked a backlash, even though the final law was a compromise version of the initial bill, he said.\n\n“The gun community was furious,” Spitzer said.\n\nThe ban has been blamed in some circles for the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1994, though subsequent research has shown that the loss was probably more about strong, well-funded conservative candidates and district boundaries, Spitzer said.\n\nStill, after Democrat Al Gore, who supported stricter gun laws, lost the 2000 White House race to Republican George W. Bush, Democrats largely backed off the issue until the Sandy Hook shooting a decade ago. Even after that, it was not a campaign topic until the 2018 midterms.\n\nNow, gun control advocates see progress.\n\n“The fact that the American people elected a president who has long been a vocal and steadfast supporter of bold gun safety laws — and recently reelected a gun-sense majority to the Senate — says everything you need to know about how dramatically the politics on this issue have shifted,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html', 'Headline': 'Biden Signs Bipartisan Gun Bill Into Law - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'After 20 children were shot and killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, Mr. Biden, the vice president at the time, was tasked by President Barack Obama with drafting a list of executive actions on guns ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — President Biden on Saturday signed into law a bipartisan gun bill intended to prevent dangerous people from accessing firearms and increase investments in the nation’s mental health system, ending nearly three decades of gridlock in Washington over how to address gun violence in the United States.\n\nFinal passage of the legislation in Congress came one month after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, left 19 children and two teachers dead, a horror that galvanized a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strike a narrow compromise.\n\n“God willing,” Mr. Biden said as he put his pen down on Saturday morning, “it’s going to save a lot of lives.”\n\nThe president acknowledged that the legislation fell far short of the sweeping measures he had pushed for, but he said it included some long-sought priorities.\n\n“When it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,” Mr. Biden said.\n\nFor lawmakers, advocates and survivors of gun violence, the law is the culmination of decades of work, building on repeated failed efforts to overcome Republican opposition and overhaul the nation’s gun laws in response to mass shootings across the country.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday signed the most sweeping gun violence bill in decades, a bipartisan compromise that seemed unimaginable until a ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday signed the most sweeping gun violence bill in decades, a bipartisan compromise that seemed unimaginable until a recent series of mass shootings, including the massacre of 19 students and two teachers at a Texas elementary school.\n\n“Time is of the essence. Lives will be saved,” he said in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Citing the families of shooting victims he has met, the president said, “Their message to us was, ‘Do something.’ How many times did we hear that? ‘Just do something. For God’s sake, just do something.’ Today we did.”\n\nThe House gave final approval Friday, following Senate passage Thursday, and Biden acted just before leaving Washington for two summits in Europe.\n\n“Today we say, ‘More than enough,’” Biden said. “It’s time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nWATCH: What the nation’s largest teachers union thinks about gun violence in schools\n\nThe legislation will toughen background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help states put in place red flag laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people adjudged to be dangerous.\n\nThe president called it “a historic achievement.”\n\nMost of its $13 billion cost will help bolster mental health programs and aid schools, which have been targeted in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, and elsewhere in mass shootings.\n\nBiden said the compromise hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators from both parties “doesn’t do everything I want” but “it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives.”\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” said the president, who was joined by his wife, Jill, a teacher, for the signing.\n\nAfter sitting to sign the bill, Biden sat reflectively for a moment, then murmured, “God willing, this is gonna save a lot of lives.”\n\nHe also said they will host an event on July 11 for lawmakers and families affected by gun violence. The president spoke of families “who lost their souls to an epidemic of gun violence. They lost their child, their husband, their wife. Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma that they had to live through.”\n\nBiden signed the measure two days after the Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday striking down a New York law that restricted peoples’ ability to carry concealed weapons. And Saturday’s ceremony came less than 24 hours after the high court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which had legalized abortion nationwide for nearly five decades.\n\n“Yesterday, I spoke about the Supreme Court’s shocking decision striking down Roe v. Wade,” Biden said. “Jill and I know how painful and devastating the decision is for so many Americans. I mean so many Americans.”\n\nHe noted that the abortion ruling leaves enforcement up to the states, some of which have already moved to ban abortion or will soon do so. Biden said his administration will “focus on how they administer it and whether or not they violate other laws, like deciding to not allow people to cross state lines to get health services.”\n\nAsked by reporters about whether the Supreme Court was broken, Biden said, “I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.” He walked away without answering more questions, noting, ” “I have a helicopter waiting for me to take off.”\n\nWhile the new gun law does not include tougher restrictions long championed by Democrats, such as a ban on assault-style weapons and background checks for all firearm transactions, it is the most impactful gun violence measure produced by Congress since enactment a long-expired assault weapons ban in 1993.\n\nEnough congressional Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the steps after recent rampages in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas. It took weeks of closed-door talks but senators emerged with a compromise.\n\nBiden signed the bill just before departing Washington for a summit of the Group of Seven leading economic powers — the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — in Germany. He will travel later to Spain for a NATO meeting.'}}",93.125,1

Republicans also alleged that Hunter Biden used his familial connections to help facilitate a meeting in 2016 between a Serbian running for United Nations Secretary-General and then-national security adviser to the vice president Colin Kahl.\n\nThe foreign payments raise questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities while his father was vice president, but the committee does not suggest any illegality about the payments from foreign sources. The bank records by themselves also do not indicate the purpose of the payments that were made.\n\nThe memo marks Comer’s most direct attempt to substantiate his allegations that Biden family members have enriched themselves off the family name. Comer has suggested that Biden may have been improperly influenced by the financial dealings, particularly by his family’s foreign business partners.\n\nBut the latest report does not show any payments made directly to Joe Biden, either as vice president or after leaving office.\n\nComer has been publicly teasing information for months about the paper trail committee Republicans have uncovered through subpoenas sent to multiple banks and trips to the Treasury Department to review records.\n\nComer and other Republicans on the committee held a press conference Wednesday morning to tout their findings.\n\n“These people didn’t come to Hunter Biden because he understood world politics or that he was experienced in it, or that he understood Chinese businesses. They wanted him for the access his last name gave him,” Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said during the news conference.\n\nOn Wednesday, Comer was asked about specific policy decisions Biden made while president or vice president that may have been directly influenced by these foreign payments. Comer failed to name any and instead pointed to then-vice president Biden traveling around the world and discussing foreign aid in the last year of the Obama administration, and added they think there are decisions Biden made as president that “put China first and America last.” Comer said the committee “will get into more of those later.”\n\nAhead of the memo’s release, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement to CNN, “Congressman Comer has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called ‘investigations’ with legitimacy. He has hidden information from the public to selectively leak and promote his own hand-picked narratives as part of his overall effort to lob personal attacks at the President and his family.”\n\nAbbe Lowell, counsel for Hunter Biden, said in a statement, “Today’s so-called “revelations” are retread, repackaged misstatements of perfectly proper meetings and business by private citizens. Instead of redoing old investigations that found no evidence of wronging by Mr. Biden, Rep. Comer should do the same examination of the many entities of former President Trump and his family members.”\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement to CNN, “Chairman Comer has failed to provide factual evidence to support his wild accusations about the President. He continues to bombard the public with innuendo, misrepresentations, and outright lies, recycling baseless claims from stories that were debunked years ago.”\n\nPayments from a Romanian business associate\n\nBank records cited in the committee’s memo show that within five weeks of then-Vice President Biden’s meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in 2015, a Romanian who Hunter Biden was doing legal consulting for, Gabriel Popoviciu, started sending money to Rob Walker, a business associate of Hunter’s.\n\nWalker received more than $3 million from November 2015 to May 2017 and wired approximately $1 million in various installments to Hunter Biden, his business associate James Gillian, and Hallie Biden, the widow of the president’s oldest son, Beau Biden who died in May 2015. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were romantically involved for a period after Beau’s death.\n\nIt has long been known that Hunter Biden did legal work for Popoviciu, a wealthy Romanian business executive who was convicted in 2016 on corruption charges.\n\nComer’s memo raises questions about why Popoviciu was paying a Biden family business associate directly instead of the law firm where Hunter Biden worked at the time or the other firm Hunter reportedly referred Popoviciu to.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani was also involved with Popoviciu, which Comer’s memo does not mention.\n\nCommittee Republicans obtained the bank records from subpoenas to four different banks.\n\nMeeting with a Biden aide\n\nThe report also alleges that in 2016, Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian politician who was running for UN secretary-general, tried to use his business relationship with Hunter Biden and his associates to get a meeting with Kahl, who was then an aide in Biden’s vice president’s office.\n\nIn a June 2016 email, Jeremic wrote to Hunter Biden and a business associate, Eric Schwerin, asking to “meet with VPOTUS National Security Advisor Colin Kahl” related to the UN secretary-general election.\n\nSchwerin instructed Hunter Biden to “Think about how you want to respond,” according to the report.\n\nIn a July 2016 email, Jeremic followed up via email saying, “[m]y meeting with Colin did not last very long, but didn’t go too bad, I think. What is suboptimal is that OVP seems to be outside the decision-making loop on the UNSG elections issue. Colin promised to get better informed on what’s going on at the moment,” according to the report.\n\nRepublicans said they intend to pursue more communications related to the matter, but concluded it appears that “a Biden administration official met with Jeremic to discuss the UN Secretary General election at the direction of Hunter Biden and/or his business associates.”\n\nKahl did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeremic’s attorneys told the committee in a letter last month he would not cooperate with a request for documents and testimony due to separation of powers issues and because House rules limit subpoenas to people “within the United States.”\n\nPayments from Chinese nationals\n\nThe memo also alleges that two Chinese nationals made payments of $100,000 to Hunter Biden’s professional corporation through a Chinese-backed energy company. Republicans claim that at least one of those individuals had ties to the Communist Party of China. These transactions, as well as Hunter Biden’s relationship with a Chinese-backed energy company once his father left the VP’s office, have long been known.\n\nThe memo alleges that the two Chinese nationals were connected to CEFC, a Chinese energy conglomerate that had a business relationship with Hunter Biden.\n\nCommittee Republicans claim one of the individuals “used CEFC to bribe and corruptly influence foreign officials.”\n\nThe memo includes a copy of a bank transaction showing that on August 4, 2017, CEFC Infrastructure wired $100,000 to Owasco P.C, Hunter Biden’s professional corporation.\n\nThe memo also includes details from the bank records on how money was moved between companies, including a $100,000 payment to one of Hunter Biden’s companies that was then funded by a Chinese based firm tied to CEFC.\n\nComer alleges the transaction “disproves President Biden’s claim that his family received no money from China.”\n\nIn the report, the committee acknowledges there “exist legitimate commercial transactions with China-based entities and individuals.”\n\n“However, the pattern of behavior engaged in by the Bidens and their Chinese counterparties—memorialized in relevant bank records—signals an attempt to layer companies and cloud the source of money,” the committee alleges.\n\nComer has previously revealed that members of Biden’s family received just over $1 million indirectly from State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company.\n\nSenate Republicans in 2020 first detailed how Walker made wire transfers to companies associated with Hunter Biden and president’s brother, James, after receiving a $3 million wire from the Chinese company.\n\nThe latest GOP memo claims Walker also sent some of that money to Hallie Biden and an unknown bank account identified as “Biden.”\n\nCommittee makes its legislative case\n\nCommittee Republicans said they are continuing to trace bank records and have written to additional witnesses involved in certain transactions to request documents as well as interviews.\n\nAccording to the report, Republicans intend to pursue legislative changes – a key step needed to justify their investigation if fights over subpoenas head to court.\n\nThose changes include laws that require additional reporting about the finances of a president or vice president’s family members, public disclosure of foreign transactions involving the family members of senior elected officials and an expedited law enforcement review of any suspicious bank activity reports related to a president or vice president’s immediately family members.\n\nComer left the door open on whether his committee would investigate the foreign business dealings of former President Donald Trump and his family ahead of making any legislative recommendations to address influence peddling. To date however, Comer has not looked into Trump’s financial dealings or pursued an investigation into the classified documents that he had at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“We’re going to look at everything when we get ready to introduce the legislation to ban influence peddling” Comer said. “This has been a pattern for a long time. Republicans and Democrats have both complained about Presidents’ families receiving money.”\n\nOn the foreign business dealings of Trump’s son-in law, Jared Kushner, specifically, Comer said, “I’m not saying whether I agreed with what he did or not, but I actually know what his businesses are. What are the Biden businesses?”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-retirement-savings-woke-protect-yourself', 'Headline': 'Biden wants your retirement savings to go woke.

That means that employees who normally do not voluntarily elect ...', 'Full_text': 'The White House recently issued a new regulation that will allow investment fiduciaries, including 401(k) plan managers, to offer investment options that consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, such as climate change and social justice initiatives. The move could radically transform retirement investing for tens of millions of Americans nationwide.\n\nUntil now, those managing many retirement accounts were required to prioritize the best return on investment possible. By opening the door to left-wing investment plans, the Biden administration is permitting employers and private pension fund managers to effectively politicize retirement investments.\n\nUnder the new regulation, a retirement account fund manager or employer must continue to pledge to prioritize the interests of retirees, a longstanding requirement, but fiduciaries will now also be allowed to include factors like climate change and other ESG considerations in their analyses and decision-making processes. This will, by design, empower left-wing employers and fund managers to use retirement accounts to push leftist causes.\n\nThe regulation is a huge win for those who support using investment dollars to promote a left-wing ideological agenda. The total value of all U.S. 401(k) accounts was a whopping $7.3 trillion in June 2021. Although not all of that wealth will likely end up in ESG funds in the wake of Biden’s regulatory change, if even just one-third of those funds do, it would mean trillions of dollars could soon flow toward companies that embrace liberal ideals.\n\nLABOR DEPARTMENT CLEARS PATH FOR 401(k) PLANS TO OFFER ESG FUNDS\n\nSome workers may not notice any changes to their 401(k) and other retirement options over the next year or two, but others will soon find themselves stuck choosing between a short list of ESG-focused investment funds, effectively requiring some workers wanting to take advantage of the tax benefits offered by 401(k) plans to contribute to beliefs with which they do not agree.\n\nThe Biden administration claims that fund managers that take advantage of the new rule are not abandoning their commitment to help retirees earn a profit, because they say that good investment decisions should take climate change and other ESG factors into account. History has shown, however, that ESG funds do not perform as well as those that simply try to earn the best return on investment possible.\n\nFor example, in an article about ESG investing published in the Harvard Business Review earlier this year, professor Sanjai Bhagat noted, ""To begin with, ESG funds certainly perform poorly in financial terms. In a recent Journal of Finance paper, University of Chicago researchers analyzed the Morningstar sustainability ratings of more than 20,000 mutual funds representing over $8 trillion of investor savings. Although the highest rated funds in terms of sustainability certainly attracted more capital than the lowest rated funds, none of the high sustainability funds outperformed any of the lowest rated funds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHow can you protect yourself from being required to invest in ESG funds? First, tell your employer, pension fund manager, or other fiduciary responsible for your retirement accounts that you are not interested in ESG investing. The Biden rule does not require ESG investments; it only allows fiduciaries to offer them.\n\nSecond, the new Biden rule permits employers to make an ESG fund the default option for employees enrolled in 401(k) accounts. That means that employees who normally do not voluntarily elect specific 401(k) investments could soon have their hard-earned money automatically invested in an ESG fund. Many workers won’t even notice the change. If you want to avoid this from happening in the coming years, be sure to submit your own 401(k) elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThird, if your employer or pension manager severely limits your options so that ESG investing is hard to avoid when contributing to a 401(k), consider other investment opportunities that would put you in greater control of your money. An individual retirement account, commonly known as an IRA, could be a better option, for example.\n\nBiden’s latest regulatory change is designed to funnel more money, potentially trillions of dollars, toward causes he and other progressives support. If you don’t want to see your money spent to advance ESG efforts, you need to start preparing now.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2023/05/10/nine-biden-family-members-who-allegedly-got-foreign-money-identified-by-house-gop/', 'Headline': 'Biden family members who allegedly got foreign money identified', 'Snippet': 'House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer identified nine members of President Biden’s family who allegedly received foreign income after teasing the bombshell for weeks.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer identified nine members of President Biden’s family Wednesday who allegedly received foreign income after teasing the bombshell for weeks.\n\n“Since you asked, I’ll tell you,” Comer (R-Ky.) told a rapt room of reporters at the Capitol after laying out new bank record evidence showing first son Hunter Biden received $1 million from a corrupt Romanian businessman while his dad was vice president.\n\n“Joe Biden’s son [Hunter], Joe Biden’s brother [James], Joe Biden’s brother’s wife [Sara], Hunter Biden’s girlfriend or Beau Biden’s widow [Hallie], however, you want to write that, Hunter Biden’s ex-wife [Kathleen Buhle], Hunter Biden’s current wife [Melissa Cohen], and three children of the president’s son and the president’s brother,” Comer said.\n\nThe chairman seemed to indicate that only one of Biden’s grandchildren and two of his brother’s children got the foreign funds.\n\n“We’re talking about grandchil — a grandchild,” Comer said at the press conference. “That’s odd, most people that work hard every day’s grandchild doesn’t get a wire from a foreign national.”\n\nJames Biden has three children, including daughter Caroline, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to making over $100,000 in charges on a stolen credit card.\n\nEmails from Hunter’s abandoned laptop show Caroline turned up her nose at an $85,000 job offer that would have allowed her to serve her probationary period near her beloved cousin in California.\n\nCaroline’s siblings are James Biden Jr. and Nicholas Biden.\n\nThe president’s other brother, Frank Biden, has two children, but Comer did not mention him and it’s unclear why Frank’s daughters, who reportedly work for NBC and as a nurse practitioner, would be involved.\n\nA Comer aide told The Post it is possible that additional Biden relatives received foreign money.\n\nBank records indicate $80,000 transferred from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu from 2015 to 2017 went to accounts identified only by the name “Biden,” for example — and a March memo from the committee indicated $70,000 from Chinese company CEFC China Energy did as well.\n\nHunter Biden and first brother James Biden were well-known for years for seeking millions from nations including China, Mexico, Romania, Russia and Ukraine — but the involvement of other family members was only more recently alleged by Comer.\n\nThe Oversight Committee issued a memo on Wednesday morning saying that Hallie Biden appears to have received $10,000 in early 2017 from Popoviciu — before receiving another $25,000 later that year as part of Hunter and James Biden’s partnership with CEFC China Energy.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tired-being-played-suckers-president-170000473.html', 'Headline': ""'Tired of being played for suckers': President Biden proposed a new ..."", 'Snippet': 'Here’s what the Biden administration plans to do to help you nurture and grow your nest egg so that you can enjoy a financially secure retirement.

The memo said the subpoenas were “tailored to specific individuals and companies that engaged in business activities with Biden family members and their business associates.” It does not detail a specific allegation of a crime committed by the president’s family.\n\nThe memo provides limited details about the allegations of the Biden family’s business dealings with foreign nationals. It alleges that the Biden family’s and associates’ activities in Romania “bear clear indicia of a scheme to peddle influence from 2015 to 2017,” saying that while Biden was vice president, his son Hunter, through an associate, received more than $1 million from a company controlled by a Romanian official accused of corruption.\n\nNBC News has reported that in 2016 Hunter Biden provided legal advice to a Romanian businessman charged with real estate fraud.\n\nThere is no evidence that Hunter Biden or his father acted improperly or violated any laws.\n\nThe memo also says the Biden family’s and associates’ “activities in coordination with Chinese nationals and their corporate entities appear to be an attempt to engage in financial deception.” The memo reiterates allegations that Comer made against Hunter Biden in March, when he alleged that the president’s son and at least two other relatives were paid $1.3 million by an associate of Hunter Biden who had been wired $3 million from a Chinese energy company that was affiliated with another company Hunter Biden had been doing business with. NBC News has reported that there was no indication that Joe Biden played any role in his son\'s dealings in China.\n\nDemocratic staffers issued their own memo to Democrats on the committee later Wednesday, hours after Comer’s was released, accusing Comer of making “unfounded accusations against President Biden and his family based on cherry-picked and misleading information about banking documents,” including Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, the committee reviewed at the Treasury Department. The memo alleged that Comer has “intentionally mischaracterized SARs documents, presenting unverified tips from financial institutions as facts.”\n\n“Committee Republicans’ inexplicable misuse of these confidential law enforcement documents is not only irresponsible, it demonstrates the hyper-partisan nature of Committee Republicans’ probe into the Biden family,” the memo said.\n\nJamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member of the committee, said in a statement accompanying the memo\'s release that Comer ""has failed to provide factual evidence to support his wild accusations about the President,"" adding, ""He continues to bombard the public with innuendo, misrepresentations, and outright lies, recycling baseless claims from stories that were debunked years ago.\n\n""Unable to implicate the President directly, Committee Republicans have resorted to using cherry-picked bank records, misrepresentations about confidential and unverified bank reports known as SARs, and baseless conspiracy theories to attack the President’s family, including his grandchildren.""\n\nIn response to Wednesday\'s memo, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said Comer ""has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called ‘investigations’ with legitimacy.""\n\n""He has hidden information from the public to selectively leak and promote his own hand-picked narratives as part of his overall effort to lob personal attacks at the President and his family,"" Sams said in a statement.\n\n""Instead of staging yet another political stunt, Chairman Comer and House Republicans should do their job, avoid default without conditions, and prevent a devastating economic crash that could cost millions of Americans their jobs,” he said.\n\nIn a statement, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden\'s lawyer, decried Comer’s latest memo as falling short of providing concrete evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n“It’s been five years of investigations into Hunter Biden and his legitimate business activities and still Republicans have nothing to show for it,” Lowell said. “Senate Republicans spent two years chasing conspiracies by those responsible for ‘Pizzagate’ and ‘the Big Lie’ and found no evidence of any wrongdoing. Now comes Rep. Comer who has spent the last five months making wild predictions without proof, asking inane questions out loud and falling short every time — including today.”\n\nLowell accused Comer of including “retread, repackaged misstatements of perfectly proper meetings and business by private citizens” in the memo.\n\n“Instead of redoing old investigations that found no evidence of wronging by Mr. Biden, Rep. Comer should do the same examination of the many entities of former President Trump and his family members,” he said.\n\nMichael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer who emerged as a key witness in a criminal case against him, slammed Comer’s memo on a call with reporters Wednesday morning.\n\n“The irony of Comer’s claims about the Biden family should not be lost on the fact that the Trump children profited more off their father’s presidency than anyone in history,” Cohen said.\n\nCohen also accused Comer of “auditioning” to become Trump’s “future vice president.”\n\n“If there are improprieties by Hunter Biden, present the evidence, not the innuendo, and allow the system can make a determination,” he said.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday morning, Comer detailed the Oversight Committee\'s next steps after the release of the memo. Comer said he sent a subpoena to the FBI last week to provide the committee with an FD-1023 form, which documents interactions with a confidential source, that a “whistleblower has alleged is in the FBI’s possession.”\n\n“If they do, the committee will assess the form it has subpoenaed from the FBI. And as has been my practice, we will report to you only facts when they are verified and indisputable.”\n\nThe FBI later rejected Comer\'s request for the document.\n\nComer also said the committee is considering legislation “aimed at deficiencies it has identified in ethics laws and disclosure laws for immediate family members, a vice president and the president.” It is also considering legislation that would “strengthen reporting requirements related to certain foreign transactions involving senior elected officials’ family members, he said.\n\nIn addition, Comer said the committee is evaluating the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering laws to “determine whether financial institutions had the available tools and support from federal agencies to thwart illegal money laundering and foreign corruption activity.”\n\nAsked whether the committee will be able to prove that the president was directly involved in his son’s business dealings and that policy changes were influenced by it, Comer did not provide examples of any specific policy decisions that were influenced.\n\n“You look at some of the decisions that Joe Biden’s made as president — there are many decisions that we would make a strong argument that put China first and America last,” Comer said. “So these are the types of decisions we’ll get into more of those later.”\n\nAs the newly minted Oversight Committee chairman, Comer in January renewed his request for the Treasury Department to turn over documents related to the business ventures of the president’s family members, including “suspicious activity reports” connected to Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother James Biden.\n\nComer said at the time that the committee “is concerned about the national security implications resulting from President Biden’s family receiving millions of dollars from foreign nationals” and “will continue to follow the money trail and facts to determine if President Biden is compromised by his family’s business schemes and if there is a national security threat.”\n\nIn his memo Wednesday, Comer again said the committee “plans to gather additional bank records in the near future and continue following the money trail” as part of its commitment to “rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse that exist at the highest level of the federal government.”\n\nHunter Biden’s finances — specifically his tax payments to the IRS — have been under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware since 2018, during the Trump administration, before his father was elected president. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe federal investigation has narrowed from an inquiry into his international business relationships, including any possible national security implications, to an examination of the income he earned from those ventures and a false statement he is alleged to have made during a gun purchase, sources said last month.\n\nFederal prosecutors have considered charging Hunter Biden with three tax crimes — possibly two misdemeanor counts for failure to file taxes and a single felony count of tax evasion related to a business expense for one year of taxes — and a crime related to the gun purchase, two sources familiar with the matter said.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/larry-kudlow-bidens-policies-appeasement-not-deterrence', 'Headline': ""LARRY KUDLOW: Biden's policies are about appeasement, not deterrence"", 'Snippet': ""I think one reason Mr. Biden's foreign policy approval ratings have fallen to rock bottom is that he avoids a realistic picture of the world scene.

We are de-risking and diversifying our economic relationship with the PRC, not decoupling. // We\'re going to continue our commitment to diplomacy, avoid surprises, prevent misunderstandings. A stable relationship between the world\'s two largest economies is not merely good for the two economies, but for the world.""\n\nThe elephant in the living room that Mr. Biden will not confront is the fact that China\'s worldwide strategy is aimed squarely at upending America\'s influence and its commitment to democratic values. The United States is a democracy. It\'s a free country.\n\nChina is a communist country – not a democracy. It is totalitarian and repressive and it is most certainly not a free country.

The Biden policies are about appeasement, not deterrence. Ronald Reagan\'s policies were about deterrence, not appeasement. Reagan said, ""We win, you lose. Reagan was never bashful about outlining the conflict with the old Soviet Union.\n\nTo my way of thinking, the Biden-Xi meetings were nothing more than a phony photo-op and, of course, Biden refuses to acknowledge that China\'s U.S.- sanction-breaking oil imports from Russia and Iran are financing two major wars against the United States. That is the reality.\n\nA ""stable relationship"" preventing ""misunderstandings"" – to use Biden\'s words – would not include these outright attacks against America and it is so ironic that China is using the very fossil fuels to fight America that Joe Biden and all his greenie minions detest so much.\n\nChina has weaponized fossil fuels. Biden has surrendered. If Donald Trump\'s ""drill, baby, drill"" policies had continued into a second term, the U.S. would be somewhere around 15 or 16 million BPD right now, probably on the way to 18 million in a couple years.\n\nAt that pace, the world oil price would be something around $40 a barrel, not $80 or $100 or even $125 where it was a year and a half ago and if that were the case, then we wouldn\'t particularly care whether China was buying oil from Iran or Russia – it would just be a drop in the bucket.\n\nThis is so much a part of Joe Biden\'s sad tale as president. It\'s not just that the middle class has to pay so much more for energy, food and other necessities, or that real wages continue to decline, and working folks have huge problems affording the Biden economy. It\'s that Biden\'s socialist Green New Deal has enormously empowered China and this is fundamentally unstable.\n\nSo, by the way, is the $350 billion trade deficit, due in large part to China\'s continued unfair trading practices and then comes the greatest irony of all.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt this photo-op in San Francisco, the State Department announces a new era of ""climate cooperation"" with China, but wait a minute!

The president pitched bold and sweeping reforms that would have represented the biggest change to retirement and retirement planning in a generation.\n\nAs of right now, virtually all of it is languishing in legislative limbo — but the situation is still fluid.\n\nThe White House is restarting negotiations with lawmakers and repackaging the legislation to make it more digestible in smaller chunks. It’s unclear what the outcome will be, but even if it remains stalled, the past year delivered big changes to the retirement landscape in America.\n\nBiden’s Retirement Plans: What Might Have Been\n\nAs negotiations around the president’s Build Back Better plan dragged on in the fall, lawmakers eventually removed every single one of the major provisions that dealt with retirement from the legislation. Had the bill passed with the president’s priorities intact, the new legislation would have:\n\nRequired most employers — those in business for two years with six or more employees — to automatically enroll their workers into an IRA or 401k-style plan, according to the National Association of Plan Advisors. The bill would have required business owners to deduct 6% of each employee’s paycheck starting in 2023, according to 401KSpecialist, and then increase the withholding by 1% each year up to 10%. Employers would have received a tax credit to offset the cost.\n\nEliminated the “back door Roth Ira” loophole that allows high-income earners to shelter money in tax-privileged accounts despite earning more money than the law was designed to allow.\n\nCreated a new kind of deferral-only 401k.\n\nModified the Saver’s Credit to be a refundable government-based matching contribution.\n\nThe retirement provisions of Build Back Better would have made major changes to the entire concept of retirement in the United States. Although they never made it out of Congress, it’s important to understand them because negotiations are ongoing. According to Reuters, the White House will likely try to pass some or even all of the retirement provisions from Build Back Better by breaking the legislation up into smaller, more passable bills.\n\nSocial Security Got a Big Boost Under Biden\n\nOne change that did go through directly affects nearly all retirees — a 5.9% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that the Social Security Administration (SSA) announced in October. When you include both Social Security and SSI recipients — some people receive both — about 70 million Americans will get significantly bigger checks this year.\n\nIssued in direct response to soaring inflation and steep increases in the Consumer Price Index, the COLA gives recipients their biggest pay raise in 40 years since 1982. The average Social Security recipient will receive $92 more per month in 2022 than in 2021.\n\n…So Did ESG Investing\n\nESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. Fund managers in the ESG investing niche make decisions based partly on things like a company’s commitment to issues like racial equality or climate change. According to Morningstar, President Trump made it “extremely difficult and risky” for employers managing retirement plans to consider ESG factors when choosing default investments for their employees.\n\nPresident Biden directed the Department of Labor to roll back those regulations, which could go a long way to bringing ESG retirement investing into the mainstream while also giving employers and their workers greater latitude to invest with their consciences.\n\nBiden Made Already-Strict Fiduciary Rules Even Stricter\n\nIn the waning days of the Trump Administration, the Department of Labor tightened fiduciary requirements for retirement advisors. Oddly enough, according to Morningstar, the end result was much the same as an Obama-era policy that was tossed out by the courts.\n\nThe new regulations required some financial professionals to document the reasons why they advised clients to roll over defined-contribution plans into IRAs and explain why doing so is in their clients’ best interest.\n\nPresident Biden is overseeing the phasing in of those new regulations, and his administration is taking things one step further. The White House has revised the mandate to increase the number of financial professionals who qualify as fiduciaries under the new rule.\n\nYou Can Contribute More Money to Some Retirement Plans\n\nIf you have a 401k plan, you can contribute $1,000 more to it this year than last, up from $19,500 to $20,500. The catch-up contribution remains the same — $6,500 — for a total contribution of $27,000. Both standard and catch-up contributions for IRAs and Roth IRAs remain unchanged. There have also been several adjustments to the maximum income phase-out thresholds for a few kinds of retirement accounts, which are determined by your filing status.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates""}}",77.58333333333333,1

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The order stems from a Freedom of Information Act document lawsuit by a coalition of doctors and scientists with the nonprofit Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency.

That means all the Pfizer vaccine data should be public by the end of September rather than the year 2097, the deadline that the FDA wanted.\n\n“Here, the court recognizes the ‘unduly burdensome’ challenges that this [Freedom of Information Act] request may present to the FDA,” the court ruling noted. “But, as expressed at the scheduling conference, there may not be a ‘more important issue at the Food and Drug Administration … than the pandemic, the Pfizer vaccine, getting every American vaccinated, [and] making sure that the American public is assured that this was not rush[ed] on behalf of the United States.”\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD VACCINE-OR-TEST MANDATE\n\nPittman’s ruling requires the FDA to start producing documents at an expedited pace — more than 12,000 pages before Jan. 31. That timeline is also in line with the agency’s proposal. But deviating sharply from the FDA’s desired timeline, the judge ordered the agency to “produce the remaining documents at a rate of 55,000 pages every 30 days, with the first production being due on or before March 1, 2022, until production is complete.”\n\nPublic Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency said the data should be made public quickly because the FDA took just under four months to review the data before granting full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n“Pfizer began its rolling submission on May 7, 2021, and the vaccine was licensed on August 23, 2021, a total of 108 days from initial submission to licensure,” it wrote in a December filing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPittman cited a quote from the late Sen.

But a popular YouTube video spins a conspiracy theory that distorts legal codes to falsely claim otherwise.\n\nFull Story\n\nAll of the four COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. were tested in large, randomized controlled trials for safety and efficacy before the FDA granted them emergency use authorization and they were rolled out to the public.\n\nTwo of the vaccines are now fully approved: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. These are the vaccines the vast majority of vaccinated Americans have received.\n\nAs is standard in clinical trials, the volunteers in the COVID-19 vaccine trials were informed of the risks and benefits so they could decide whether to participate, or what is known as informed consent.\n\nYet a Jan. 7 YouTube video that racked up more than 300,000 views in its first three days falsely claims the trials were a sham. The video also incorrectly suggests the trial participants did not give informed consent.\n\n“A bombshell new report shows that the Department of Defense — yes the pentagon — controlled the COVID-19 program from the very beginning, and everything we were told was political theater, basically to cover it up, right down to the FDA vaccine approval process,” says host Clayton Morris, at the start of the video. “It was all theater. That means that human beings were used as props.”\n\nThe 17-minute video is an episode of the YouTube show Redacted, which Morris co-hosts with his wife and which has previously trafficked in misinformation, including about COVID-19. Morris is a former “Fox & Friends” host and real estate investor who moved to Portugal following fraud allegations by former clients.\n\nThe video features Alexandra, or Sasha, Latypova, who is described as “a former executive of a pharmaceutical contract research organization.” She has previously made media appearances with organizations opposed to vaccines, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense, and has written for the pseudoscientific website TrialSiteNews.\n\nIn the Redacted interview, Latypova makes a series of false claims, many predicated on her misreading of government contracts and the legal code. Lawyers with expertise in the area told us the claims are bunk.\n\nFalse Claim About ‘Theatrical’ Clinical Trials\n\nLatypova kicks off her interview by claiming “the Department of Defense used very shady contracting practices and also used several laws that were put in place previously … to shield pharmaceutical companies, to not conduct, you know, proper clinical trials.”\n\n“As a result, we have this theatrical performance called clinical trials, but they were actually not real,” she continues. “Based on the laws that are used here and then involved in this process, clinical trials are not required at all. And, and in fact they cannot be conducted.”\n\nThis is patently false. All of the vaccine clinical trials were very much real. Not only have thousands of Americans participated in these trials, some of whom have been interviewed for news stories, but there are reams of data from these trials that the FDA reviewed prior to issuing the emergency use authorizations and the approvals.\n\nThese data were also reviewed by multiple independent review groups for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in publicly accessible meetings, and the results were also published in peer-reviewed journals. The notion that these trials were not real strains credulity and requires conspiratorial thinking.\n\nLatypova’s mischaracterization likely stems from her misreading of the laws governing emergency use authorizations, or EUAs. It’s true that an EUA, which can cover a variety of diagnostics, treatments or vaccines during an exceptional situation such as a pandemic, is different from a full approval — and does not necessarily require a clinical trial.\n\nHowever, the legal code specifically says that an EUA can consider data “from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available.” And for the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA made clear in guidance that clinical trials were required.\n\nAn October 2020 FDA guidance document states that for a COVID-19 vaccine “for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure its quality and consistency, issuance of an EUA would require a determination by FDA that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.”\n\n“For vaccines (and new drugs like Paxlovid, which also received an EUA) the FDA always requires clinical trials,” Villanova University law professor Ana Santos Rutschman told us. “Technically, guidance is not binding,” she added, “but we’ve never seen FDA depart significantly from guidance it issues in any of these areas.”\n\nAnd of course, trials were indeed performed for all of the vaccines that received an EUA, contrary to Latypova’s claim that they were fake.\n\n“The difference between an EUA and other forms of regulation is that the standard for effectiveness is that ‘it is reasonable to believe’ that a product is effective,” Rutschman explained. “‘Reasonable to believe’ is a lower standard than the one required for full approval; this means that companies are able to submit clinical trial data to the FDA sooner than they normally would under the full approval pathway. But the clinical trials still have to be ok’ed by the FDA, which also reviews all the data generated during the trials, and keeps monitoring the product even after it is authorized under an EUA, as well as after full approval.”\n\n“Sasha Latypova’s argument is a classic example of a causal fallacy,” Jacob S. Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told us. “Latypova assumes that because some clinical investigations are not required under an EUA, they could not have occurred.”\n\n“It’s bogus as a matter of law, as a matter [of] logic, and a matter of fact,” he added.\n\nFalse Informed Consent Claim\n\nAnother of Latypova’s false claims is the suggestion that informed consent wasn’t obtained in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.\n\nShe cites the 21st Century Cures Act signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama, saying the law changed “the informed consent requirements, such that subjects don’t have to be necessarily informed of what’s going on if it’s deemed not in their best interest.”\n\nLatypova proceeds to suggest that this is what happened in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. “They don’t have to inform the subjects what it is, they can use a lot of secrecy, they don’t have to run clinical trials, they’re not required, because these products cannot be investigational products, that’s what the law says,” she says, repeating her claim about the trials. “If they cannot be investigational products, then we don’t have any investigation, we don’t have any clinical trial subjects. So that’s how they’re pulling this off.”\n\n“[I]t’s just nonsense,” Sherkow said. “There’s nothing in the CURES Act that says, ‘No informed consent for clinical trials.’”\n\nRutschman agreed, noting that the Cures Act allows for small modifications to informed consent in certain situations, but does not “do away with informed consent requirements.”\n\nOther scientists have published research analyzing the informed consent documents used in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. While the researchers concluded the forms should have been shorter and easier to read, it’s simply not true that such forms did not exist.\n\nLatypova’s related legal claim about “investigational products” refers to a particular part of the legal code about EUAs (21 U.S. Code § 360bbb–3(k)) that states the use of an EUA product “shall not be considered to constitute a clinical investigation.” But Rutschman said Latypova’s interpretation of those words is “entirely incorrect.”\n\nRather than meaning that an EUA product cannot be studied in a clinical trial, as Latypova has incorrectly assumed, the law is saying that an EUA product still needs to be studied or continued to be studied in a clinical trial to receive full approval, Rutschman said.\n\n“The provision is saying this is a particular pathway to bring products to market during an emergency, but use of these products is not a clinical investigation; if you’re going to seek full approval you have to continue running trials even as you make the vaccines/drugs available under an EUA,” she explained.\n\nOther Assorted Claims\n\nAmong Latypova’s numerous other false claims (we aren’t covering them all) is the suggestion that the pandemic was “planned” and that an unnamed “they” — presumably the government — want to relinquish control to the World Health Organization.\n\n“The pre-planning goes [back] years,” Latypova says. “For example, there is pandemic enterprise. It’s a quasi-private, quasi-government enterprise that’s been set up in 2013 that involves 10 heads of federal agencies.” She calls the group a “cabal” and claims the majority of the efforts were focused on maintaining secrecy.\n\n“It’s almost like they knew this was coming,” Morris interjects. “This is where we talk about conspiracy theories on the show. I mean, it’s all true.”\n\nIt’s unclear which entity Latypova has in mind. The most likely candidate is a group known as the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. It’s primarily made up of officials in multiple agencies, but includes industry partners, and helps to coordinate the government’s response during public health emergencies. It was created in 2006.\n\nIn any case, it’s incorrect to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims before, as we’ve written. The reality is that well before 2019, scientists and government officials had been concerned about pandemics, including those caused by coronaviruses. Trying to prepare for them is not evidence that they were orchestrated or planned.\n\nNear the end of the video, Morris suggests that “they’re already planning the next one” — presumably referring to the government and the next pandemic — and Latypova agrees.\n\n“The next important thing that they want to do is give up our sovereignty to WHO,” she says, referring to the International Health Regulations.\n\nWe’ve explained before that the WHO can make recommendations for countries to follow during global health emergencies, but the WHO doesn’t have authority over countries to force compliance.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Latypova and Morris make much of the Department of Defense’s role in the COVID-19 vaccine program, there is nothing unusual about it.\n\n“DoD is always very involved in vaccine R&D,” Rutschman said, noting that historically, many vaccine-preventable diseases occur outside of the U.S. where American troops are often deployed. “[I]t’s totally normal for DoD to be the contracting agency; as funders, they have an interest in demanding that their funding recipients perform R&D that is compliant with FDA regs and likely to obtain authorization/approval if the resulting product is good.”\n\nAs for the claim the Department of Defense used “shady” contracting methods, Rutschman explained that the contracting mechanism, known as “other transaction authority,” or OTA, simply allows the department to purchase items or services quickly — and is hardly unprecedented.\n\n“DoD had used the OTA pathway many times before COVID-19,” she said. “This form of contracting enables the government to move faster; it is perfectly legal and well-regulated.”\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44. Over half of American businesses in China either delayed or decreased investments in China due to lockdown measures, according to a recent survey by the local U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThanks to current measures, “China might be seen as a less reliable trading partner than previously,” says Nordin, of Kings College. “The question is how much less reliable than other possible alternatives?”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add1891', 'Headline': 'Zeroing out on zero-COVID | Science - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID helped slow the spread and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID U-Turn Reveals Xi Jinping’s Deep Paranoia - TIME', 'Snippet': 'The decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health ...', 'Full_text': 'Even for China, where the distance between official narrative and empirical evidence is often a chasm, the last few days have been jarring. On Tuesday, officials announced five deaths from COVID-19—up from two the previous day, which were the first recorded in the country since Dec. 3. On Wednesday, there were officially none. But a glance online tells a different story. Dozens of hearses line up at a Beijing crematorium; bodies wrapped in orange plastic pile in hospitals; patients on ventilators are crammed on a ward floor.\n\nThe decision by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership to roll back its stringent zero-COVID policy and allow the virus to proliferate has led to a surge in cases and an immense strain on health services. It’s a quite staggering reversal. On Nov. 10, President Xi Jinping—the self-anointed “commander-in-chief” of a “people’s war” against the virus—instructed his Politburo to stick “resolutely” to “dynamic zero-COVID.” Residents of Shanghai were forcibly detained in quarantine facilities over the summer because of a single case in a neighboring housing block.\n\nRead More: China’s Zero-COVID Trap\n\nBut zero-COVID was virtually abandoned on Dec. 7, with China’s top medical adviser now comparing the Omicron variant to “flu.” On Dec. 13, a tracking app that had tyrannized every life in China for the past three years was abruptly taken offline. On Sunday, officials in the central city of Chongqing decreed that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases could “go to work as normal.”\n\nThe screeching U-turn underlines the fickle nature of strongman rule but also the immense paranoia of the CCP when faced with public discontent, such as the protests that erupted in late November across several Chinese cities. The catalyst was the deaths of at least 10 people in an apartment block fire in China’s western city of Urumqi that observers blamed on draconian pandemic controls keeping residents locked in their homes. (Officials deny this.) It spurred a wave of protests, with scores of people gathering on streets and university campuses across the country, shouting “we want freedom, not PCR tests,” and even “down with Xi Jinping.”\n\nRead More: Detained Zero-COVID Protesters in China Share Their Stories\n\nThe sudden rollback of restrictions that followed “could be seen as a victory for people power,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nStill, the policy climbdown is surprising. China’s security services were swift to track down and detain demonstrators, who were never close to forming a political opposition. “They never quite galvanized into a single, unified, politically actionable message,” says Wen-Ti Sung, a scholar specializing in Chinese elite politics at the Australian National University. But what likely spooked Xi was the breadth of discontent that zero-COVID engendered. Affluent Shanghainese, embattled students facing bleak job prospects, and migrant workers in southern factories all railed against its privations and related economic blowback in distinct but analogous acts of rebellion. Their concerns were well-founded; models suggest zero-COVID may have cost the Chinese economy $384 billion and reduced GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points.\n\nIt’s perhaps unsurprising that a CCP spawned from popular revolution should fear the wrath of the masses most of all. In truth, however, over two-thirds of the 303 autocrats ousted from power worldwide between 1946 and 2008 were unseated by elite coups, with only a small minority bested by popular uprisings. The lesson being that rather than fear a mob over the horizon, leaders like Xi should be looking over their shoulder. It’s clear that he does the latter too, of course; by assuming a protocol-breaking third leadership term in November, while stocking his inner circle with loyalists and lackeys, Xi has doggedly insulated himself from potential rivals.\n\nHerein may lie the problem. The fear was always that this new leadership’s homogeneity would undermine the quality of its policy-making. “That it has been having a hard time facing its first major test—smooth transition out of zero-COVID—has not been helpful in dispelling those concerns,” says Sung. The government saw the economic pain of zero-COVID and wanted to make adjustments. But local officials who for the past three years have been judged first and foremost on stamping out the virus were naturally hesitant. So the central leadership had to take bolder steps to force their arm such as dismantling the nationwide tracking apparatus. Cue the lurch from one extreme to another. Today, China is caught between Xi’s two festering paranoias—fear of the people, and of challenges within the party.\n\nThe consequences may be dire. With virtually no community exposure to the virus, and only low efficacy domestic vaccines, the surge in cases will no doubt result in many deaths—some models predict over 1 million—despite official denials. Zhang Wenhong, a prominent Chinese doctor often likened to America’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that China’s medical institutions will face their “darkest hour” by next month.\n\nInstead, a new propaganda campaign has taken over. Previously, pandemic chaos in the West was painted as evidence of liberal democracy’s failings. Meanwhile, China’s success in banishing the virus was proof of a superior political system. But on Dec. 12, the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily newspaper instead framed zero-COVID as a necessary stopgap to buy time while the virus’s severity waned and effective treatments were developed. Its dismantling, so it went, was always in the works. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” it wrote.\n\nThe problems with this account are myriad and glaring. If this opening up was long-planned, then surely more efforts should have been made to vaccinate the elderly. Currently, only 42% of over-80s have had three doses of the vaccines, according to government figures. Today, people seeking boosters are being turned away from clinics due to a lack of supply. The most vulnerable could have been given more effective foreign vaccines. (On Tuesday, the U.S. offered China mRNA vaccines, though nobody expects the nationalistic CCP to accept.) In addition, effective antivirals like Paxlovid should have been stockpiled; one Chinese website sold out its supply in half-an-hour.\n\nPublic health experts also struggle with the logic of opening up some six months after most Chinese have had their last jab, given the rapidly decreasing efficacy of vaccines over time. Not to mention there’s just weeks before China’s Spring Festival—humanity’s largest annual migration, when some 200 million Chinese cram into buses and trains for long journeys to ancestral villages where medical facilities are rudimental at best.\n\n“Even healthcare workers were caught off-guard [by the reversal],” says Huang.\n\nYet the CCP’s account is already written. On Dec. 14, authorities stopped reporting infections deemed “asymptomatic,” which in China is often stringently defined as those not confirmed with a chest scan. Then, on Dec. 20, officials said that they would only include on its official COVID-19 death tally those who had tested positive for the virus and died of respiratory failure or pneumonia—excluding anyone with complicating conditions, as is frequently the case with elderly patients. The aim is to push home the message that China suffered the lowest COVID-19 toll of any major power.\n\nMany Chinese will no doubt buy the propaganda. But a large number have had their eyes opened by the bungling of zero-COVID, the lives lost to suicides and treatable ailments that worsened in an ultimately futile attempt to stamp out the virus. The protests only serve to show that the party is, in fact, fallible and responsive to public anger, that the people have more power than anyone thought. “This will be very encouraging for Chinese civil society, which has had very little space to work in for years,” says Sung. The irony is, of course, that so far they have only nudged the CCP from suffocating control to callous inaction.\n\n“I don’t know how anybody can have confidence in China anymore,” says one Shanghai resident, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisals. “Disruption and unexpected things is one thing, but a government pulling the rug under your feet is quite another.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00059-023-05183-5', 'Headline': 'The COVID-19 pandemic in China: from dynamic zero-COVID to current ...', 'Snippet': 'On 8 January 2023, after 3 years of pandemic control, China changed its management of COVID-19, applying measures against class B infectious diseases instead of Class A infectious diseases.

With a population of 1.41 billion, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by ...', 'Full_text': 'It is challenging to strike a balance between epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00873-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Zero COVID in China: what next? - The Lancet', 'Snippet': ""The zero-COVID strategy has been the pillar of China's anti-epidemic policies for over 2 years.

The emergence of highly transmissible Omicron variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that sustaining this policy is unfeasible, with mounting economic costs and growing public dissatisfaction2. In mid-November 2022, the National Health Commission released 20 measures toward gradual relaxation of the ‘zero COVID’ policy3. This was further streamlined to 10 measures in early December as the most substantial move so far toward living with the virus4. This included allowing home isolation for mild symptoms, dropping testing requirements for most venues and domestic travel, implementing targeted rather than large-scale lockdowns, and emphasizing the vaccination and boosting of people over 60 years of age. As China grapples with its largest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, these measures have largely been welcomed after 3 years of the most stringent control measures of any country.\n\nA pro-equity focus is needed alongside relaxed policies for COVID-19, given the disproportionate impact of the disease on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, which generally have lower vaccination rates5, especially as immunity wanes6. Socio-economic disadvantage lowers a person’s ability to adhere to measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, vaccination and self-isolation7. Factors related to this include inadequate health literacy, which may be positively associated with vaccine hesitancy; overcrowded living and working conditions; limited income to afford personal protective equipment; and limited benefits such as sick leave8.\n\nInvestment is needed to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on at-risk socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Access to high-quality healthcare services such as intensive care unit beds has been lacking, especially in the socio-economically deprived areas of central and Western China9, which could greatly reduce access to timely treatment. People on low incomes are often less aware of their chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) status and have less access to effective treatment for NCDs, which in turn places them at greater risk for COVID-19 sequelae10. Although the new COVID-19 measures have increased resources for treatment, ongoing limitations of health service availability in socio-economically deprived areas pose challenges for adequate treatment use. Furthermore, it is unclear if existing financial subsidies for covering out-of-pocket expenditure for COVID-19 treatment will be sustained, particularly as increasing cases of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 emerge. Ending these subsidies would pose financial risks for those on low incomes or with limited health coverage.\n\nWe believe that the following actions are critical to avoid reinforcing existing health inequities as China develops its new policy approach. First, accelerate universal vaccination, including highly effective booster shots, among the general population, focusing on outreach to older people in socio-economically deprived rural areas, where there is limited access to health services. Vaccination programs should target those working in industries that require frequent close contact with others, informal migrant workers, and those in dense living conditions. Second, promote universal masking in higher-risk settings, and continue access to affordable personal protective equipment and testing. This includes the direct provision or offer of subsidies to low-income households, as well as low-cost or free testing. Third, offer COVID-19 treatments to all, in order to prevent substantial mortality from COVID-19, particularly in at-risk communities. This could include mobilizing trained health personnel to provide treatment, including anti-viral agents and oxygen therapy, for people with severe COVID-19 in areas with limited healthcare services, during the winter months, when cases are likely to be higher. Fourth, collect socio-economic demographic data on routine health records. This would support the monitoring of health inequities, including those related to COVID-19, as well as facilitate targeted health interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nFifth, promote preventative behaviors, together with free primary health screening for NCDs, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are underlying risk factors for COVID-19. These measures are in line with the Healthy China 2030 plan, which emphasizes a life-course approach to NCD prevention and management. This could provide opportunities for promoting COVID-19 vaccination and risk reduction, as well as opportunities to strengthen the quality of care for NCD management. An ongoing commitment to investing in health infrastructure, capacity building and affordable NCD management in the most resource-limited regions of China would support equitable access to high-quality healthcare services, including those for COVID-19.\n\nShifting resources away from intensive ‘zero COVID’ measures and onto targeted public health interventions, with an emphasis on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, would be the most equitable way forward. As the mass migration of people for the Chinese New Year approaches, the time for drastic outreach is now.""}}",99.0,1

He cited the Northwest Connection Chamber of Commerce (NWCCC), which provides business development assistance and resources to businesses in North Austin, Humboldt Park, Montclare, Belmont Cragin and Hermosa, as a model.\n\n“I think having a strong chamber is vital to the communities,” he said. “The [NWCCC] is a strong organization, and I think that’s what our West Side needs from the business perspective — a very strong chamber.”\n\nJudith Alexander, the chair of The North Avenue District, said that Augustus hadn’t reached out to her as of Feb. 17, but she thought that having a regional chamber that would help local chambers is a good idea.\n\n“We do our best to find out and share programs and share web seminars,” she said. “ Let’s say one of our businesses needs help applying for something, it would be great if there is a resource, because, right now, we don’t have the bandwidth to do that.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/2023/06/18/as-development-comes-to-south-shore-gentrification-is-focus-of-group-aiming-to-safeguard-residents/', 'Headline': 'South Shore group aims to safeguard residents from gentrification', 'Snippet': 'Tonya Trice, executive director of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, speaks during a Special Service Area #42 meeting on April 21, 2023, in the South Shore neighborhood.', 'Full_text': ''}, 6: {'URL': 'https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/chicagoglobal/juggling-glitter-how-chambers-commerce-chicagos-commercial-corridors', 'Headline': 'How some Chicago chambers of commerce are supporting migrants | Chicago ...', 'Snippet': 'The Andersonville Chamber of Commerce has a small staff, and organizing support for the city’s surge of migrants has pushed its staff past a “stereotypical nine to five of what most chambers do,” said David Oakes, the district manager at the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce.

In September, the Biden administration granted Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who have arrived in the U.S. since July 31. But getting migrants’ work permits approved is taking longer than the Andersonville and Lincoln Square Ravenswood chambers would like. Businesses can’t legally hire migrants until the paperwork is processed and approved.\n\n“We’re asking for folks to speed it up,” said Oakes, who has been talking with Representative Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) about securing more work permits.\n\nThe chambers said they haven’t heard about many businesses successfully hiring new migrants. Both chambers pointed out that this could still be happening, but Oakes said that the federal government’s application approvals have been “extremely slow.”\n\nAlderman Matt Martin’s 47th ward includes parts of Andersonville, Lincoln Square, and Ravenswood, and his office has collaborated with the chambers to support migrants who recently arrived. His office told ChicagoGlobal that the application includes several hurdles that might be too difficult for migrants to clear.\n\nApplications for work permits cost more than $500 for most adults. Waiving this fee requires filling out an application in English and mailing it to Washington, D.C., according to Martin’s office.\n\nThe chambers organize job fairs and have worked with nonprofits that help with job placements for refugees, including migrants who have applied for asylum. But without work permits, it’s not clear how many recent arrivals could benefit from these services.\n\nIn the meantime, Oakes says, local block clubs are hiring migrants – usually for yard work in cash – to help support them.\n\nIn the long run, Tobin hopes that migrants can help relieve the labor shortage in Lincoln Square and Ravenswood.\n\n“Writ large in Chicago, we’re seeing a labor shortage in hospitality, food production, health care, transportation. And these are people that could be employed to help fill the gap in those fields,” Tobin said.\n\nTransitioning to winter\n\nAs the weather turns colder, Chicago is adapting its migrant response to prepare for winter. Plans include building temporary tent shelters for migrants. On October 19, Alderwoman Julia Ramirez and an aide were surrounded and allegedly assaulted by protesters upset with the city’s plan to open a tent camp for migrants in Brighton Park.\n\nNeither the Andersonville chamber nor the Lincoln Square Ravenswood chamber said they have heard complaints about migrants from their members. So far, he’s only heard from businesses that want to “actively engage” and help provide material and financial support to migrants.\n\nHollenbeck says that shoppers in Andersonville “want to know that they are making a difference with their dollar.”\n\n“I think it’s really easy to feel hopeless and disillusioned and helpless,” said Hollenbeck. But, she says, donating helps her fight back against those feelings.\n\n“The least we can do,” Rabinowitz said, is “offer them compassion and support as a human.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://wgntv.com/politics-3/your-success-is-our-success-chamber-of-commerce-offers-warm-welcome-to-mayor-johnson/', 'Headline': 'Chamber of Commerce offers warm welcome to Mayor Johnson', 'Snippet': 'CHICAGO — Mayor Brandon Johnson addressed the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce at their annual membership meeting Tuesday, receiving warm welcomes and open arms along the way. “Your success is…', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/on-demand/economy/how-the-government-and-communities-can-address-ongoing-business-issues', 'Headline': 'State of American Business Chicago: What Government Can Do to Address ...', 'Snippet': 'During opening remarks at the State of American Business Chicago Summit, Jim Kirk, Group Publisher and Executive Editor at Crain’s Chicago Business, spoke with Suzanne P.

These challenges have changed how we do business globally and the responses the government should implement to keep our economy thriving.\n\nDuring opening remarks at the State of American Business Chicago Summit, Jim Kirk, Group Publisher and Executive Editor at Crain’s Chicago Business, spoke with Suzanne P. Clark, President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, about generation-defining issues faced by Chicago businesses and nationwide businesses alike.\n\nThe Business Community Must Help Foster Job Creation\n\nClark noted that the U.S. Chamber consists of “a real federation of people who believe, no matter what party they belong to … that a job is good for a community, is good for our country, is good for health outcomes, [and] is good for environmental outcomes.”\n\nClark posed the question: “What is it that we can do as a business community to help job creators do what they do best?”\n\n“Chicago's doing a great job of it,” she said. “We have eight board members in Illinois. We have members in Illinois that represent 18 industries and half a billion dollars in revenue.”\n\nAdditionally, on the small business side, she continued, there are record business startups in Chicago and in Illinois as a whole.\n\n“I came here to see that, to feel the energy, to see the innovation and what you're all building, and to learn what we can do to be more helpful,” she said.\n\nEncouraging Competition Will Help the Business Community Solve Ongoing Issues\n\nAccording to Clark, “competition's at the heart of free enterprise” — and encouraging competition is healthy for the economy.\n\n“It's really at the heart of democracy and the founding of our country,” she said. “I love to meet entrepreneurs who say, ‘I have an idea. I have something I can make better — I wanna compete and bring that to market.’”\n\nClark noted that her job is to find ways to create and protect the space for people to experiment with their ideas and bring them to fruition.\n\n“I love watching the competition for ideas win the future,” she said. “We have big complex problems that we're facing, but we can do it. We can find the solutions, we can find the answers through the spirit of competition.”\n\nThe Government Must Step Up To Address Crime and Public Safety\n\nChicago is especially facing pitfalls due to crime, with more than 50% of small businesses falling victim to shoplifting in 2022, according to Clark. As a result, 46% of those small businesses have raised their prices.\n\n“No American family needs anything more inflationary right now,” Clark said. “This is a real problem for families, communities, and businesses.”\n\nHowever, more concerning is the “inability to keep their employees and customers safe, and we're hearing about it nationwide,” she continued. “[We need] better prosecutors prosecuting crime, harsher criminal penalties, lower thresholds for a felony, and [a safer] online marketplace for sellers.”\n\n“There is a really serious role for government,” Clark added. “We want to be safe [and] there are really important roles for the government to be playing, and when they try to do everything, they stop doing the things they really need to do.”\n\nClark added that addressing government overreach isn't simple.\n\n“We need the government to do the really specific things we need them to do, and I think public safety's at the top of that list,” she said.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://wgntv.com/news/wgn-news-now/gov-pritzker-speaks-to-chicagoland-chamber-of-commerce/', 'Headline': 'Gov.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas. He must reportedly surrender on or after Jan. 5, 2024.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': ""On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker's Lobby on January 6."", 'Full_text': 'On Monday, the Associated Press published a report about Ashli Babbitt, the Capitol rioter who was shot and killed by a police officer while trying to enter the Speaker\'s Lobby on January 6. In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://patch.com/california/san-diego/ashli-babbitt-martyr-her-past-tells-more-complex-story', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt A Martyr? Her Past Tells A More Complex Story', 'Snippet': 'In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.', 'Full_text': ""Ashli Babbitt, who lived in San Diego, was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop.\n\nAs she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nTimothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt's birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\nBy MICHAEL BIESECKER Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.""}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/pelosi-jan-6-capitol-riot-video/index.html', 'Headline': 'CNN Exclusive: New footage shows congressional leadership at Fort ...', 'Snippet': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command ...', 'Full_text': 'Never-before-seen footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe January 6 select committee aired snippets of the footage at its public hearing on Thursday, but CNN has obtained roughly an hour of additional material that wasn’t presented by the panel.\n\nCongressional leaders contemplated, far more seriously than previously known, whether to reconvene the Electoral College proceedings at Fort McNair, the footage obtained by CNN reveals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes.

""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6,"" said the title of one video posted Jan. 19, 2022.\n\n""She was trying to stop those people from busting up the place, and then had to flee from them,"" the speaker in the video said. ""That’s why she went through the window, and then got shot, got assassinated by that f------- rent-a-cop.""\n\nThe video offered a conspiratorial retelling of what transpired during one of day’s most scrutinized moments, when Babbitt attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby, where lawmakers were being evacuated. It relied on an interpretation of Jan. 6 footage from a right-wing outlet that made unsubstantiated claims about Babbitt’s words, actions and frame of mind in the moments before she died.\n\nIn reality, there is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob — or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa.\n\nThe insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of them whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election. The officer who fired the bullet that killed Babbitt — Lt. Michael Byrd, a Capitol Police officer for 28 years — was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations.\n\nA video spread on YouTube and other platforms wrongly claimed Ashli Babbitt tried to stop an antifa false flag on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThis video spread widely anyway, racking up 200,000 views on YouTube and tens of thousands more on the alternative platforms like Rumble and Bitchute. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA litany of false and conspiratorial claims\n\nThe creator of the video is a self-described former Obama voter and special education teacher who now posts live-streams and other content under the persona ""the Salty Cracker.""\n\nHis website has a disclaimer at the bottom of his website that reads, ""These are the opinions and ramblings of a lunatic. They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nMany of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong:\n\nHe called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasn’t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.\n\nHe insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" That’s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.\n\nHe said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" That’s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.\n\nNo documented antifa presence\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speaker’s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""\n\nHere’s how he described what happened before her death:\n\n""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire. Donald Trump supporters trying to extinguish the false flag, and apparently Ashli Babbitt was one of these individuals, and we got it on tape … As she’s trying to stop them, then they start chasing her. So then she’s got to climb through. She can’t go backwards, so she’s got to go forward.""\n\nBut several rioters denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbitt’s shooting Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year designation.\n\nRELATED VIDEO\n\n""We have no cases of antifa in our database of individuals charged with breaking into the Capitol,"" said Roderick Cowan, the executive director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which maintains a database on the more than 700 people facing charges. ""Nor have we ever seen evidence of a named individual who supports antifa there.""\n\nAmong the rioters nearby when Babbitt died were Zachary Alam, the rioter wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat who smashed the windows to the Speaker’s Lobby that Babbitt later climbed through; Chad Barrett Jones, who helped bust the glass with a rolled-up Trump flag; and Thomas Baranyi, who wore a Trump-Pence hat and left the Capitol with Babbitt’s blood smeared on his hand.\n\nA speculative video analysis\n\nBut what about the pro-Trump mob? Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?\n\nThroughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speaker’s Lobby, video shows.""\n\nThe article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbitt’s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speaker’s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didn’t heed the call.""\n\nThe article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges.\n\nThe Epoch Times’ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Don’t! Wait!""\n\nThose claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time.\n\nWhether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.\n\nOther footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But it’s not clear that she was confronting him.\n\nExperts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact it’s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivan’s video what Babbitt was saying. She’s far away from Sullivan’s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.\n\n""This is a classic ‘cocktail party effect’ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbitt’s voice from Sullivan’s video.\n\nOne rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (It’s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)\n\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP)\n\nThe Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt.\n\nHansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape.\n\nBut Hansen’s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Footage shows her not pinned but moving freely prior to the incident..\n\nOur ruling\n\nA YouTube video claimed, ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6.""\n\nThe video was posted by a creator whose website includes a disclaimer saying his opinions are meant ""for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""\n\nIn this case, the video’s central claim that Babbitt was fighting to thwart an antifa false flag is a ridiculous rewriting of what happened inside the Capitol. Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nThere was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mob’s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.\n\nWe rate this YouTube video Pants on Fire!'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.

But he says ‘Ashli Babbitt’.""\n\nThat is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to overturn the former president’s election defeat.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a police officer as she climbed through the window of a barricaded door inside the Capitol building. She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it.

Fontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 ...', 'Full_text': 'Quick Take\n\nThe Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state. The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

(Nagel Photography via Shutterstock) The Supreme Court on Monday afternoon denied a request from the leaders of the Arizona legislature to put on hold an order that would require them to be deposed about the legislature’s enactment of voting laws that make it more difficult to register to vote.', 'Full_text': 'The Supreme Court on Monday afternoon denied a request from the leaders of the Arizona legislature to put on hold an order that would require them to be deposed about the legislature’s enactment of voting laws that make it more difficult to register to vote. In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-arizona-house-speaker-testifies-he-was-pressured-to-overturn-2020-election-results-despite-no-evidence-of-fraud', 'Headline': 'WATCH: Arizona House speaker testifies he was pressured to ... - PBS', 'Snippet': 'Among the requests that Bowers said Trump made of him was that he remove and replace Arizona’s electors to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s win in Arizona.

Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/arizona-fake-electors-face-legal-130045420.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors face legal jeopardy, experts say - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'GOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College.', 'Full_text': 'The people who falsely claimed to be Arizona\'s 2020 electors might not be named in the federal indictment of Donald Trump, but they still face serious legal peril, as do the people from Trump\'s team who directed them, some experts say.\n\nBut the legal debate over the issue has experts taking both sides, perhaps signaling that if an Arizona case develops, it won\'t be a slam dunk.\n\nGOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College.

The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://tucson.com/news/local/federal-judge-tosses-last-lawsuit-that-remained-against-arizonas-election-results/article_e2e4ed09-f0f5-51db-992c-676483d116de.html', 'Headline': ""Federal judge tosses last lawsuit that remained against Arizona's ..."", 'Snippet': 'The 11 Arizona electors pledged to Joe Biden are set to cast their votes Monday, Dec. 14, even as yet another court hearing is set in a bid to… Arizona Senate issues subpoena demanding access to ...', 'Full_text': 'PHOENIX — A judge tossed out a bid by the head of the Arizona Republican Party to void the election results that awarded the state’s 11 electoral votes to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe two days of testimony produced in the case brought by GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward produced no evidence of fraud or misconduct in how the vote was conducted in Maricopa County, said Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Randall Warner in his Friday ruling.\n\nWarner acknowledged that there were some human errors made when ballots that could not be read by machines due to marks or other problems were duplicated by hand.\n\nBut he said that a random sample of those duplicated ballots showed an accuracy rate of 99.45%.\n\nWarner said there was no evidence that the error rate, even if extrapolated to all the 27,869 duplicated ballots, would change the fact that Biden beat President Trump.\n\nThe judge also threw out charges that there were illegal votes based on claims that the signatures on the envelopes containing early ballots were not properly compared with those already on file.\n\nHe pointed out that a forensic document examiner hired by Ward’s attorney reviewed 100 of those envelopes.\n\nAnd at best, Warner said, that examiner found six signatures to be “inconclusive,” meaning she could not testify that they were a match to the signature on file.\n\nBut the judge said this witness found no signs of forgery.\n\nFinally, Warner said, there was no evidence that the vote count was erroneous. So he issued an order confirming the Arizona election, which Biden won with a 10,457-vote edge over Trump.\n\nFederal court case remains to be heard\n\nFriday’s ruling, however, is not the last word.\n\nWard, in anticipation of the case going against her, already had announced she plans to seek review by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAnd a separate lawsuit is playing out in federal court, which includes some of the same claims made here along with allegations of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThat case, set for a hearing Tuesday, also seeks to void the results of the presidential contest.\n\nIt includes allegations that the Dominion Software voting equipment used by Maricopa County is unreliable and was programmed to register more votes for Biden than he actually got.\n\nLegislative leaders call for audit but not to change election results\n\nAlong the same lines, Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the software and equipment used by Maricopa County in the just-completed election.\n\n“There have been questions,” Fann said.\n\nBut she told Capitol Media Services it is not their intent to use whatever is found to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election.\n\nIn fact, she said nothing in the Republican legislative leaders’ request for the inquiry alleges there are any “irregularities” in the way the election was conducted.\n\n“At the very least, the confidence in our electoral system has been shaken because of a lot of claims and allegations,” Fann said. “So our No. 1 goal is to restore the confidence of our voters.”\n\nBowers specifically rejected calls by the Trump legal team that the Legislature come into session to void the election results, which were formally certified on Monday.\n\n“The rule of law forbids us to do that,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Bowers pointed out, it was the Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted a law three years ago specifically requiring the state’s electors “to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide canvass.”\n\nHe said that was done because Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote nationwide in 2016 and some lawmakers feared that electors would refuse to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Trump, who won Arizona’s race that year.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in a prepared statement. “But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen. David Farnsworth was leading with 64% of the vote to Bowers\' 36% as of Wednesday morning, according to the Arizona secretary of state\'s office. Trump supported Farnsworth in the race, and blasted Bowers as a ""RINO coward"" at a rally last month.\n\nBowers testified on June 21 before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing focused on a plan by Trump\'s allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona.\n\nBowers resisted that effort, telling the committee that the scheme to replace Mr. Biden\'s electors with a fake slate for Trump was a ""tragic parody.""\n\nEarlier this year, Bowers helped block a bill to empower the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted.\n\nBowers has been a Republican for 30 years.

The governor or secretary of state might have refused to certify an election, or issued conflicting claims. A state legislature built in Trump’s image could have tried to toss out the results and appoint their own electors. All of this would have set up tough votes for Republicans in the House and Senate in response, who already faced threats to both their careers and lives on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Arizona results, along with similar candidates winning nominations in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan, raise the prospect of more forceful attempts at these tactics in 2024 should the Republican presidential nominee lose.\n\nBut this is a nightmare scenario that the House and Senate were already thinking about long before Tuesday’s results. In fact, the Senate held a hearing on Wednesday on a bipartisan bill to reform the Electoral Count Act designed with exactly this case in mind.\n\nWhile not foolproof, election experts advocating for the legislation argue it would provide a potentially strong defense against every one of the above possibilities.\n\nHere’s how it would work: The bill would require states to abide by their pre-election laws for appointing electors, making it harder to ignore the election results. If, say, the Arizona governor certified the results, but the secretary of state or other officials sent a rival slate of electors, only the governor’s would count. If the governor were the one refusing to honor the results, it would provide a direct path for federal courts, and eventually the Supreme Court to weigh in, and direct Congress to accept their decision. It would also clarify the definition of a “failed election” that was a prerequisite for some attempts to overturn the results in state legislatures.\n\n“The bill would limit the ability of both the legislature and the governor to mess with genuine election results,” Rick Hasen, an elections expert at UCLA's law school who has supported the legislation, told NBC News. “If the governor tries to not follow state law in certifying the election for Trump or someone like him, there is a procedure to get courts involved.”\n\nSeparate from the state concerns, the bill also would address “potential for mischief” in Congress, as Genevieve Nadeau, a lawyer with the nonpartisan group Protect Democracy, put it to reporters Wednesday. It raises the threshold for objections to results and clarifies that the vice president can’t overrule results, which were the two immediate triggers for the Jan. 6th protests that ended with rioters storming the Capitol.\n\nThe House is also considering election legislation, and some experts supportive of the Senate bill's goals have raised technical concerns about some provisions. But the Senate version has significant Republican support already and could become law in some form this year. If it does, the unfolding story in Arizona goes a long way to explaining why.""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/arizona-fake-electors-kifle-invs/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election ...', 'Snippet': 'But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across ...', 'Full_text': 'They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nInstead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.\n\nMuch attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.\n\nNow those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.\n\n“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.\n\n“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”\n\nAll 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.\n\nOf the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.\n\nEach of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.\n\n“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.\n\nElectors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.\n\nCNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.\n\nFive vocal fake electors\n\nThe most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.\n\n“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.\n\nWard’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.\n\n“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.\n\nAnother prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.\n\n“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.\n\nIn repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.\n\n“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.\n\n“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.\n\nA spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.\n\nBowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.\n\nNewly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.\n\n“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nIn interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.\n\nThen-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.\n\n“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.\n\n“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.\n\nKern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.\n\n“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.\n\nKern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/arizona-election-changes-ctzn/index.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona is ground zero for election changes | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Maine Sen.

Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a “12-committee lynching.”\n\nArizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take – describing Bowers’ takedown as “killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.”\n\nThen came Rep. Mark Finchem’s resolution this month on Arizona’s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump’s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nBowers’ response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: “Mr. Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.”\n\nBowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history – at least when it comes to some of his party’s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.\n\nHe has described Trump and the then-President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.\n\nBowers told CNN’s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. “I said, ‘No, I won’t,’” Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, “‘3.5 million people voted here, I’m not gonna unilaterally do that.’”\n\nBowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.\n\nArizona at ground zero\n\nEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nThey include bills that would:\n\nA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.\n\nAlex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with “holding the line” to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.\n\nBut, he said, “there are actually a lot of bad things” moving through the legislature “that people are being silent about.”\n\nThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.\n\nVoters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov.

Rand Paul and Roger Marshall came in a hearing on the federal response to the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the Biden administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration – issues the GOP has seized on.\n\nEarly in the hearing, after Paul sought to cast Fauci as a “dangerous” government official, the White House chief medical adviser and top infectious disease expert said such rhetoric “kindles the crazies” and has led to threats against his family.\n\n“What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life – threats upon my life – harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me,” Fauci said before suggesting the Kentucky Republican was attacking him as a way of raising money.\n\n“So I asked myself, ‘Why would Senator want to do this?’ So, go to Rand Paul website.

After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen. Rand Paul and, to some extent, Sen. Roger Marshall, were ad hominems, which does nothing but distract from what we really need to be doing,” he said.\n\nIn response to the hearing, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN in a statement Tuesday that Republicans on the panel “clearly weren’t trying to stop the spread” of misinformation.\n\n“At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,” spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\n“The Biden Administration will continue to focus on getting more Americans vaccinated and boosted and helping Americans get access to the tools to keep themselves and others safe.

Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/fauci-says-sen-pauls-false-accusations-kindle-the-crazies-who-threaten-his-life/2610481/', 'Headline': ""Senate Hearing on Pandemic Gets Testy: ‘What a Moron' - NBC Boston"", 'Snippet': 'Republican Sen.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/18/bu-lab-wasnt-required-to-clear-potentially-controversial-study-with-nih-director-says/', 'Headline': 'BU lab wasn’t required to clear Covid study with NIH, director says', 'Snippet': 'Courtesy NIAID-RML.

The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/news/fauci-knew-nih-funded-wuhans-gain-of-function-research-as-pandemic-began-email-reveals/', 'Headline': ""Anthony Fauci Knew NIH Funded Wuhan's Gain-of-Function Research as ..."", 'Snippet': 'Months later, a top NIH official admitted in an October 2021 letter that the NIH did fund gain-of-function research on coronaviruses, despite Fauci’s argument to the contrary.', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs. Fauci and Collins, and instead of being on a mission to destroy two people, I wish we were on a mission to get the facts,” she said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/nih-to-terminate-ecohealth-alliance-grant-after-its-wuhan-partners-refuse-to-deliver-information-on-coronavirus-studies/', 'Headline': 'NIH to terminate part of EcoHealth Alliance grant after its Wuhan ...', 'Snippet': 'In an Aug. 19 letter to Kentucky Rep James Comer, the top Republican member of the US House Oversight Committee, Michael Lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at NIH, said the agency had informed EcoHealth that it was terminating the sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology “for failure to meet award terms and conditions ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institute of Health (NIH) is partially terminating a grant to a nonprofit that worked extensively with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research.

The agency then asked for lab notebooks and other files pertaining to the experiments, and EcoHealth reported that it would relay the request to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the new NIH letters, the Wuhan institute never delivered.\n\n“NIH has requested on two occasions that [EcoHealth] provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology]. To date, [the institute] has not provided these records,” Lauer told Comer. NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit.

In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China has been at the centre of the debate over COVID-19’s origins. ...

The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64891745', 'Headline': ""Covid-19 origin debate 'squashed', ex-CDC chief Dr Robert ... - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'BBC News, Washington DC.

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system.\n\nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\n\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66983060', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists behind mRNA Covid vaccines - BBC', 'Snippet': 'An mRNA Covid vaccine contains the genetic instructions for building one component - a protein - from the coronavirus.

Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers-heres-how-their-discovery-was-integral-to-covid-vaccine-development-214763', 'Headline': 'Nobel prize in medicine awarded to mRNA pioneers – here’s how their ...', 'Snippet': 'Researchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest.

The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified.

Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday.

Yet the field shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nPioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel\n\nIn the wake of the technology’s dramatic success in generating quick-turnaround COVID-19 vaccines, investors have poured billions of dollars into expanding mRNA’s therapeutic reach.\n\nThis influx of cash promises to fuel the research and infrastructure needed to deploy mRNA medicines in ways that could transform public health by tackling hard-to-treat infectious diseases, cancers and rare genetic disorders.\n\n“The sky’s the limit,” says Matthias Stephan, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. “For whatever you want to correct, or whatever you want to treat, there could be an mRNA medicine — that’s the excitement.”\n\nNature spoke to researchers about mRNA medicines that are on the horizon.\n\nCurbing outbreaks: when speed is of the essence\n\nVaccines based on mRNA rose to fame not only for their safety and efficacy, but also for the speed with which they were developed and rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe approach allows researchers to have “a very potently effective vaccine in arms within weeks”, says Barney Graham, who helped to develop one of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines while at the US National Institutes of Health. (Graham now serves as senior adviser for global health equity at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.)\n\nHow COVID unlocked the power of RNA vaccines\n\nThe vaccines deliver mRNA that instructs a person’s cells to create copies of viral proteins, also known as antigens. This process stimulates the body to generate protective antibodies and virus-fighting immune cells.\n\nBecause synthetic mRNA can be designed and manufactured in days, the technology allows vaccines to be reformulated quickly each year to address the ever-evolving nature of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Or it can be deployed as a rapid-response tool in the face of new infectious threats. For example, Moderna, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has trialled mRNA vaccines against the monkeypox, Zika and Nipah viruses.\n\n“We can definitely take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of mRNA vaccine production,” says Norbert Pardi, a vaccine scientist at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia who has worked closely with the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — immunologist Drew Weissman, also at UPenn, and biochemist Katalin Karikó at the University of Szeged in Hungary. In the mid-2000s, the two laureates developed some of the foundational technology used to create mRNA vaccines.\n\nWily foes: tackling tough pathogens\n\nCompanies already have mRNA vaccines moving through the pipeline that target familiar pathogens. For instance, Moderna has a jab to protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which causes cold-like symptoms in most people but can be life-threatening to babies and older people — under review at the US Food and Drug Administration. Its public-health impact might be limited, however, because two protein-based vaccines beat it to approval.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nWhere the technology could really make a difference is with pathogens that drug firms haven’t been able to crack. One is cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that has eluded vaccine developers for more than 50 years and that causes birth defects in infants, as well as potentially deadly infections in people with compromised immune systems. “This is where mRNA has been quite a game-changer,” says Sallie Permar, a paediatric infectious-disease researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\n\nCMV uses a bundle of five proteins to enter and exit human cells, an antigen configuration that is difficult for protein-based vaccines to emulate. But with mRNA, researchers can simply provide the genetic instructions that a cell needs to produce the five proteins. The cell itself then does the heavy lifting of properly assembling the subunits into one antigen complex, just as happens during a natural infection.\n\nEarly results1 suggest that Moderna’s CMV vaccine, now in phase III trials, stimulates a stronger immune response in some tissues than do natural infections. “It’s an exciting time to end the most common cause of infectious disability,” says Permar, who has collaborated with Moderna to study the vaccine’s immune potential.\n\nCancer vaccines: the next frontier\n\nThe future of mRNA vaccines is not limited to infectious disease. “The next big thing is cancer, for sure,” says Derrick Rossi, interim chief executive at the New York Stem Cell Foundation in New York City and a co-founder of Moderna.\n\nThe lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines — and what it means for other diseases\n\nCancer researchers have long sought a vaccine that could be used to train the immune system to fight tumours — only to see promising candidates fail in clinical trials. Cancers have been a tough nut to crack because malignant cells mutate rapidly, weakening therapeutics’ power.\n\nWith mRNA, researchers can develop cancer vaccines that target dozens of antigens on tumour cells simultaneously. Hitting several targets at once could make it harder for cancer cells to evolve ways to evade immune responses elicited by a vaccine. Clinical trials of a new class of personalized cancer vaccine are under way: these vaccines use mRNA aimed at a collection of mutated proteins that are found in an individual’s own tumour.\n\nBut mRNA’s applications in cancer could have a wider reach, says Elad Sharon, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. “This is broader than just vaccines.”\n\nModerna is testing therapies that deliver mRNA instructions for making immune-stimulating molecules, such as cytokines, in cells to see whether they can amplify the effects of existing cancer immunotherapies2. And BioNTech, a biotechnology company in Mainz, Germany, is developing similar mRNA therapies that coax cells to generate antibodies that can help to rouse an immune response.\n\nGenome editing: improved delivery\n\nWhen researchers began working with mRNA as a therapeutic, the fact that the molecule could degrade quickly made it difficult to work with.\n\nWays of generating longer-lasting mRNA molecules could help. Yet, in some cases, mRNA’s fleeting nature is an advantage. When it comes to genome-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, researchers don’t want DNA-cutting enzymes to linger in the cell, because of the potential for unintended edits. mRNA represents a way to shuttle instructions for making the enzymes into cells and have them disappear after they’ve done their job.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\n“This is a perfect use of mRNA,” says Rossi, who co-founded a company called Intellia Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is using mRNA to deliver the gene-editing machinery needed to correct two rare diseases. “You want it around for a short while, you want it to do its job, and then you want it to go away.”\n\nOther companies, including one that Weissman co-founded called Capstan Therapeutics, are deploying mRNA to equip immune cells with enhanced disease-fighting functions. In these applications, the amount of protein elicited from mRNA is just enough to allow efficient editing or reprogramming, but not enough to introduce unwanted effects.\n\nAs researchers develop improved ways of targeting mRNA to desired locations in the body, its potential genome-editing applications will expand, says Lior Zangi, who studies mRNA therapeutics for heart regeneration at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “There’s a real possibility that this will lead to many new drugs for many different diseases,” he says. “That will be the real future.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6319654/nobel-prize-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers/', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize Awarded to Work Behind COVID-19 Vaccine | TIME', 'Snippet': 'Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03046-x', 'Headline': 'Pioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Although COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.” Nature 622 , 228-229 (2023)', 'Full_text': 'This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to biochemist Katalin Karikó and immunologist Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccines have been administered billions of times, saved millions of lives and prevented millions of cases of severe COVID-19, said the Nobel committee.\n\nKarikó, who is at Szeged University in Hungary, and Weissman, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia (UPenn), paved the way for the vaccines’ development by finding a way to deliver genetic material called messenger RNA into cells without triggering an unwanted immune response.\n\nThey will each receive an equal share of the prize, which totals 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million).\n\nKarikó is the 13th female scientist to win a Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology (see ‘Nobel imbalance’).

That’s what I hope,” she tells Nature.\n\nA new chapter\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and the Pfizer–BioNTech collaboration deliver mRNA that instructs cells to create copies of a protein that is found on SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, called the spike protein. This stimulates the body to make antibodies that target the protein, as well as triggering other immune responses.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nFor decades, mRNA vaccines were considered unfeasible because the injection of mRNA into the body triggered an immune reaction that immediately broke down the mRNA. In the mid-2000s, working at UPenn, Karikó and Weissman demonstrated that swapping one type of molecule in mRNA, called uridine, with a similar one called pseudouridine bypasses the cells’ innate immune defences1.\n\n“I’m delighted to see them recognized,” says Robin Shattock, a vaccine scientist at Imperial College London who has worked on mRNA vaccines. “Their contribution was really fundamental in the success of the COVID-19 vaccines, and I think will underlie RNA technology for some time to come.”\n\n“They demonstrated that changing the type of the RNA nucleotides within the vaccine altered the way in which cells see it,” said John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist at Imperial College London, in a press statement for the UK Science Media Centre. “This increased the amount of vaccine protein made following the injection of the RNA, effectively increasing the efficiency of the vaccination: more response for less RNA.”\n\n“This discovery has opened a new chapter for medicine,” said Nobel committee member Qiang Pan Hammarström, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference after the prize announcement. “Investment in long-term basic research is very important.”\n\nVaccine revolution\n\nThere are now mRNA vaccines in development for a number of other diseases, including influenza, HIV, malaria and Zika.\n\n“It’s really like a revolution starting since the COVID pandemic,” says Rein Verbeke, an mRNA vaccine researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. He adds that Karikó and Weissman’s contributions were essential to the vaccines’ success during the pandemic, and beyond. “Their part was really crucial to the development of this platform.”\n\nA COVID-19 mRNA vaccine containing unmodified RNA, developed by CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, was widely seen as a flop after its mediocre performance in clinical trials.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\nAnother key component of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that surround the modified RNA and ease its entry into cells. Numerous scientists contributed to the development of LNPs, says Verbeke, and it would have been nice if the Nobel committee had also recognized their contributions to mRNA vaccines. The modification of mRNA and the development of LNPs “were the two major steps that were necessary to have mRNA vaccines working”, he says.\n\nMany people were involved in developing LNPs, however, and it would be difficult to single out any one contribution, says Pierre Meulien, who worked on using mRNA to trigger immune responses in the 1990s at Transgène, a small biotech firm near Strasbourg in France. Karikó and Weissman “really created the key to success of the whole enterprise around mRNA vaccines”, he adds.\n\nThe development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics is still in its infancy, says Shattock. Scientists and biotechnology companies are busy coming up with new applications for mRNA technology, from cancer treatments to next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Many teams are also working on improved ways of delivering mRNA. “What we see used today is not what’s going to be used in the future,” he says. “We’re at the beginning of an RNA revolution.”\n\nAlthough COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/health/mrna-vaccine-technology-explainer-scn/index.html', 'Headline': 'mRNA vaccines: 5 things to know - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Potential beyond fighting Covid-19 The advent of mRNA vaccine technology has led to safe and strong protection against Covid-19.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nTwo pioneering scientists who created the technology behind life-saving Covid-19 vaccines have won the Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology.\n\nDr. Katalin Karikó and Dr. Drew Weissman, both of the University of Pennsylvania, achieved their breakthrough by harnessing the power of genetic material known as messenger RNA, or mRNA.\n\nTheir discoveries have opened up a new chapter in medicine, paving the way for new vaccines for other infectious diseases, including the flu, and treatments for noninfectious diseases such as cancer.\n\nHere are five things to know about Karikó and Weissman’s game-changing research and mRNA vaccines.\n\nWhat mRNA does\n\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is a form of nucleic acid that tells cells what to do based on the information contained in DNA.\n\nUnlike DNA, which acts as an instruction manual for life contained in every cell, mRNA is a temporary piece of genetic code that can create a protein or repair damage. Researchers often use a cookbook analogy. DNA is a thick recipe book, while RNA is the handwritten copy of an individual recipe that gets scrunched up and thrown away after use.\n\nScientists have long known about about mRNA, but it was previously thought to be too unstable to have value as a therapeutic tool.\n\nWhat the Nobel laureates discovered\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s key breakthrough was in finding a way to alter the building blocks of RNA, called nucleotides, in order to make our bodies produce an immune response.\n\nRobin Shattock, a professor of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said the pair’s “seminal work” in understanding how to configure RNA was critical to the success of the highly effective mRNA vaccine against Covid-19.\n\n“Their fundamental work in using modified nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, to avoid activation of the innate immune system will be key to the successful use of future RNA vaccines and new RNA based medicines,” Shattock said.\n\nHow mRNA vaccines differ from other vaccines\n\nMany vaccines use weakened or dead versions of the viruses they’re targeting — not enough to make a person sick, but an amount that will make the immune system respond so the body will produce antibodies if it encounters the real virus. These are called vector vaccines.\n\nAnother related technique — employed in protein subunit vaccines — uses purified pieces of a virus in order to trigger an immune response.\n\nHowever, development of those types of vaccines can be lengthy, and it can be difficult to modify them quickly.\n\nMessenger RNA-based vaccine technology doesn’t rely on a modified version of a virus to produce an immune response. It uses modified mRNA to tell the body’s cells to produce proteins that train the immune system to defend the body against a particular disease.\n\nWhat the team overcame\n\nKarikó’s fascination with the therapeutic potential of mRNA started while she was in grad school in Hungary and never wavered despite multiple setbacks, job losses, doubt and a transatlantic move. Her conviction that it could be used to fight disease drew skepticism, and the grants she applied for were often rejected.\n\nKarikó, now an adjunct professor of neurosurgery at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine, met Weissman by chance in 1997. The Nobel committee said Weissman’s background in immunology and Karikó’s expertise in RNA biochemistry meant the two scientists complemented each other well.\n\n“I think the important thing is that we couldn’t have come to the result without both of us being involved,” said Weissman, the Roberts Family Professor of Vaccine Research at Perelman School of Medicine, in a video shared Monday by the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTheir groundbreaking study was published in 2005, 15 years before the Covid-19 pandemic began.\n\nThomas Perlmann, secretary general of the Nobel Assembly for medicine, said that back then there were many roadblocks to overcome before they could use the technology in vaccine form. Those obstacles included manufacturing mRNA in large quantities and refining a delivery method for mRNA into cells. However, he said their seminal work meant that mRNA-based Covid vaccines got off “to a flying start” when the pandemic came along.\n\nPotential beyond fighting Covid-19\n\nThe advent of mRNA vaccine technology has led to safe and strong protection against Covid-19. But proponents say this is just the beginning.\n\nEarly studies suggest mRNA technology shows promise as a treatment for cancers, including melanoma and pancreatic cancer, and it’s being studied for use in vaccines forseasonal flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and HIV.'}}",97.5,1

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-what-weve-learned-about-so-called-lockdowns-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/', 'Headline': ""What We've Learned About So-Called 'Lockdowns' and the COVID-19 ..."", 'Snippet': 'A study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive ...', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17104-6', 'Headline': 'A systematic review of the direct and indirect COVID-19’s impact on ...', 'Snippet': 'The summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1).Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31 ...', 'Full_text': 'Food security is defined as having healthy, nutritious, and physically and economically accessible food available to people in a defined geographic location and which satisfies the individuals’ dietary needs [1]. COVID-19, a communicable disease caused by the viral pathogen SARS-COV-2, continues to have multi-dimensional impacts all over the world [2,3,4]. Since its nominal emergence (31 December 2019), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the food security of people across the world [5,6,7,8,9]. Specifically, the pandemic has impacting the food security of individuals and communities both directly and indirectly by overwhelming the agricultural productivity, exacerbating the energy poverty [10], and diminishing personal health and financial stability [11,12,13]. Prior to COVID-19, approximately 820 million individuals faced hunger each day globally, with over two billion individuals experiencing micronutrient deficiencies. These dietary issues in turn lead to increased risk of mortality and morbidities [14, 15]. COVID-19’s emergence resulted in disruptions to the production, processing, transporting, and marketing of food [15], which has caused flow-on impacts to food security. For example, fresh food products, including meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, all recorded extensive price increases due to obstructions in transport channels [16]. A joint statement released in 2020 by the World Health Organization, (WHO) amongst others [14], reported that 3.3 billion global workers were identified as being at risk of losing their livelihood due to COVID-19. COVID-19 had exacerbated the already existing malnutrition in children. Further, 149 million children were estimated to have growth abnormalities, such as stunted (reduced in their growth performance), globally due to COVID-19 and other confounding factors, including natural disasters like drought, desert locust emergence, war and displacement [17]. The food security issues that arose due to COVID-19 were felt globally [18, 19], however, the level of crisis was more significant in lower-income countries [15] than in middle- and high-income countries.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) [1], there are four food security dimensions: availability; accessibility; usability; and sustainability/stability. Food availability is defined as the presence of adequate amount of food that satisfies the demand of the general population within a specified territory [20], while accessibility is the retrievability of food without excessive physical and/or economic barriers [21]. Usability of food refers to the nutritional quality of food and focuses on whether the accessible and available food is balanced, healthy, and nutritious [21]. This available and accessible food should then be able to satisfy the dietary and nutritional demands of the individual, households, community and/or the general population [20,21,22]. This food should be sustainable/stable by being available, accessible, and useful for a prolonged time [15, 20, 21]. All the four dimensions of food security are interdependent to each other and the effects of a certain factor that impacts one dimension can directly or indirectly overwhelm another [1]. As such, it is not appropriate to talk about food security using only one food security dimension. For instance, it is meaningless to discuss food accessibility, stability, and usability if food is not available and it is not rational to talk about food usability if food is not accessible.\n\nA recent article has identified the burden of COVID-19 pandemic on all the four dimensions [23], while another examined some of the food security dimensions [24]. Interestingly, findings from Iran showed that the emergence of COVID-19 had short term positive impact on food security of households and individuals [25]. Studies on the impact of COVID-19 were conducted in different geographic locations of the world, but the findings are currently inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. As a result, a compiled summary of all the available information, and which is informative for policy makers, food input suppliers, aid agencies and governmental and non-governmental bodies, is considered an appropriate research goal. In addition, identifying whether (and which) different food security dimensions have been impacted to greater or lesser extents during COVID-19 may assist local, regional and national government bodies in mitigating any emerging food insecurity issues.\n\nTo achieve these outcomes, a systematic review was conducted of all studies regarding COVID-19’s impact on food security. This paper examines the extent to which food security was directly and indirectly compromised by COVID-19, and how food security actors recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic induced food insecurity trauma. The application of findings of this systematic review are not necessarily restricted explicitly to COVID-19 as they may also have potential significance in early preparedness of the inevitable future pandemics. The purpose of this article was to summarise the food security impact of COVID-19 and pointing out the critically impacted dimension/s of food security. The specific questions that guided this systematic review were:\n\n1.\n\nHow much was food security directly and indirectly affected by COVID-19?\n\n2.\n\nWhich, if any, dimensions of food security were significantly compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nMethodology\n\nThis systematic review was undertaken in line with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [26] and checklist [additional file 1]. In addition, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review checklist was used as a second point of reference to guide the process. Prior to the systematic review commencing, a protocol was prepared and registered in ROSPERO database with registration number CRD42022325475 and it was published online [27]. As indicated in the following sub-headings, each aspect of the PRISMA checklist was addressed sequentially.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nPrimary research articles conducted on COVID-19’s impact on food security were the focus of the systematic review. However, so as to allow for comparative analysis of the burden of COVID-19, potential articles had to specifically focus on at least one of the four defined dimensions (food availability, accessibility, usability and stability) both prior to and/or following the emergence of COVID-19. No restrictions were placed on study design, with any qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies considered. Other types of literature (grey literature, review articles, protocols, reports, letters to editors and unpublished studies) were excluded from review. The reasons for excluding information sources other than primary research articles were to ensure the goal of identifying information from the primary source, and which were supported with data and followed expected research standards and procedures.\n\nIt is expected that primary research articles published in different languages on the topic of interest might be available in online information sources (databases), but only studies written in English were included. The timeframe for publication was from the approximate time of emergence of COVID-19 (31 December 2019) through to the end of this systematic review’s literature search (15 May 2022) were included.\n\nInformation sources, search strategy, and selection process\n\nFour databases (Web of Science; Scopus; PubMed; and Google Scholar) were used as the literature sources. The data from these four databases was identified from the nominal date for COVID-19 pandemic emergence (31/12/2019) through to 15/05/2022. All reference lists from the studies identified through the initial database searches were then explicitly assessed to avoid missing any relevant data source.\n\nA combination of search terms was used. The same terms were used for three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), and search strings were applied according to the relevant database. As explained in the protocol [27], the search terms used for Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were “Impact” OR “Effect” OR “Burden” AND “COVID 19”) OR “COVID-19 pandemic” OR “SARS COV 2” OR “Coronavirus disease 2019” OR “Coronavirus diseases 19” OR “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2”) AND “Food Security” OR “Food Insecurity” OR “Food Security dimension”. The publication date (31/12/2019—15/05/2022), the publication language (English), and the article type (primary research articles) were used as a filtering mechanism during the searching process. For identifying literature from Google Scholar, the short title of this systematic review (the COVID-19’s impact on food security, availability, accessibility, usability and stability) was used, and any potentially relevant articles that were not identified from other databases were included. Details of the search strategy for each database is described as follows.\n\nScopus: ( ALL ( impact) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( effect) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( burden) AND ALL ( covid 19) OR ALL ( covid-19 AND pandemic) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( sars AND cov 2) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND disease 2019) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( coronavirus AND diseases 19) OR ABS ( severe AND acute AND respiratory AND syndrome AND coronavirus-2) AND ALL ( food AND security) OR ALL ( food AND insecurity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( food AND security AND dimension)) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE, ""ar"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBSTAGE, ""final"")) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE, ""English"")).\n\nPubMed: (((((((((((Impact[Title/Abstract]) OR (Effect[Title])) OR (Burden[Title])) AND (COVID 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (COVID-19 Pandemic[Title/Abstract])) OR (SARS COV 2[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019[Title/Abstract])) OR (Coronavirus diseases 19[Title/Abstract])) OR (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2[Title/Abstract])) AND (Food Security[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Insecurity[Title/Abstract])) OR (Food Security dimension[Title/Abstract]).\n\nWeb of Science: Impact (All Fields) OR Effect (Abstract) OR Burden (Abstract) AND COVID 19 (All Fields) OR COVID-19 pandemic (All Fields) OR SARS COV 2 (Title) OR Coronavirus disease 2019 (All Fields) OR Coronavirus disease 19 (All Fields) OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Abstract) AND Food Security (All Fields) OR Food Insecurity (All Fields) OR Food Security dimension (Abstract) and 2020 or 2021 or 2022 (Publication Years) and Article (Document Types) and English (Languages).\n\nGoogle scholar: COVID-19, Food Security, Impact, OR COVID-19, OR Pandemic, OR Food OR security, OR availability, OR accessibility, OR usability, OR stability.\n\nThe first author conducted the primary screening, and the same process was repeated by the other team members to ensure the validity and reliability of selection processes. Identification of potentially eligible studies was conducted initially through title and abstract screening, prior to a full text review occurring. A pre-determined process for resolving any disagreements was established, however ultimately there were no disagreements in the selection process among the review authors.\n\nData items and collection process\n\nStudies selected from the four databases were imported to EndNote X9. Literature searches were undertaken on 01 May 2022 for the first time and repeated 2 weeks later for the second time. The identified articles were de-duplicated using EndNote X9’s unique identifier function. Any redundant studies missed by the EndNote unique identifier were manually de-duplicated. The studies were considered regardless of the studies’ statistical analysis, geographic coverage, and study participants (individual, household, community or country). All COVID-19 related factors that exacerbated the food insecurity of individuals/households, such as COVID-19 prevention restrictions, agricultural production interruptions, job losses, import–export bans, and mortality of productive workforces, were synthesised into the final results.\n\nStudy risk of bias assessment\n\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used for assessing the risk of biases. The eight items of the JBI checklist are designed for assessing the risk of biases in reviewing primary studies with Yes, No, Unclear or Not Applicable answers. The items of the checklist are: 1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria of samples; 2) study subjects and settings; 3) exposure measurement validity and reliability; 4) objective and standard criteria of condition measurement; 5) identification of confounding factors; 6) strategies to deal with confounding factors; 7) validity and reliability of outcome measures; and 8) the use of appropriate statistical analysis in included studies.\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist, each included study was independently appraised by a second author and no disagreement were raised among team members.\n\nEffect measures and synthesis methods\n\nCOVID-19-related food production or supply chain restrictions was considered as impacts on food availability. Food security reductions due to physical or economic constraints during COVID-19 were classified as food inaccessibility. The food quality and diversity reduction during the pandemic was interpreted as the impact of COVID-19 on food usability. Short-term food items availability that cannot be sustained due to the direct (effect on the food supply chain) and indirect (health and economic burdens) impacts were deemed to be food stability issues. Food insecurity increases during COVID-19 as compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity were expressed in the form of percentages. Overall, one or more food security dimension/s that was/were repeatedly reported by the majority of the included studies was identified as significantly altered dimension by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSynthesis of this systematic review was focused on investigating COVID-19’s impact on food security and/or its four dimensions (availability, accessibility, usability and stability). Any included studies that failed to consider relevant confounding food insecurity drivers were critically appraised in the discussion and risk of bias assessment sections of this systematic review.\n\nReporting bias and certainty assessments\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool was used for assessing reporting biases in the studies. As recommended by Berkman et al. [28], the authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the papers using the AHRQ checklists. Based on the checklists, the studies with a high probability of reporting bias were categorised as “suspected” and the studies with a low probability of bias were noted as “undetected.” The certainties of evidence were assessed using the GRADE tool. The alignment of findings, the consistency of evidence, the level of suspected publication biases, the limitations of reviewed studies, and the availability of target outcomes in the reviewed studies were considered as factors for certainty.\n\nStudy selection\n\nOf the initial sample of 2,057 studies identified through the first search, 1,220 were found through database searching and the remaining 837 were from other sources, such as the aforementioned review of reference lists (Fig. 1). Of the 1220 papers found through database searches, 27 were identified as eligible for review, but 20 were removed due to the lack of pre-COVID-19 food security information. Fourteen potentially eligible studies were identified from other sources; 11 of these were removed because they were duplicates of studies already identified. Overall, this resulted in seven studies from the database search and three studies from other sources being included in the final sample of ten papers (Fig. 1). The study by Pradeilles et al. [29] in Peru was initially considered eligible to be included for review, but was removed due to a lack of pre-COVID-19 data for the food insecurity experience scale (FIES) indicator.\n\nCharacteristics of the reviewed studies\n\nTwo papers were published in 2020, seven in 2021, and one in 2022 (Table 1). Three studies [18, 30, 31] were conducted in the United States of America and the remaining studies included countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, Chile, Mexico, Lebanon, and Iran (Table 1). Only one study [16] covered the food insecurity prevalence of two countries (Kenya & Uganda), with the others covering either a single county or a province [25, 32] in a single country, or populations [30, 31] in the same country.\n\nThe summarised objective of all reviewed studies was to determine COVID-19’s burden on food security and associated dimension/s using the pre and post-COVID-19 food security analysis (Table 1). Four studies [25, 32,33,34] assessed the food security levels of households, three [16, 18, 36] identified the effect of the pandemic on the food security of individuals, while two studies [30, 31] investigated food insecurity levels in college students before and at the time of the pandemic in the United States of America. The remaining study [35] assessed food security of mothers before and after the pandemic in Bangladesh. The majority (8 out of 10) of the studies used a cross-sectional study design (Table 1) and the remaining studies used interrupted time series [35], and predictive model [36] designs. As indicated by Gaitán-Rossi et al. [33], food security of households with children was reduced. Contrary to the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies, the research conducted in Iran’s Tehran province [25] reported that the emergence of COVID-19 resulted in improved food security among households.\n\nRisk of bias in studies\n\nBased on the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies, six studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias in all 8 items of the checklist while 4 studies [25, 32, 35, 36] were found to have unclear risk of bias in four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q6) of the checklist (Table 2). Eight of the included studies used cross-sectional study design and the remaining two studies [35 and 36] had used predictive model and interrupted time series study designs. The JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was designed for analytical cross-sectional studies and it was challenging to find a specific and appropriate risk of bias assessment tool for the two studies that used a predictive model [36] and interrupted time series [35]. Since the main difference of these study designs from cross-sectional methodologies is time-frame and ways of measurement, the JBI critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies was considered still potentially suitable for predictive model and interrupted time series designs, and was therefore used.\n\nThe compromised food security dimension and its associated factors\n\nA majority (9 out of 10) of the studies used validated food security indicators, while one [36] of the studies estimated the food insecurity prevalence using a predictive model from previous food insecurity trends. The most compromised food security dimension identified across nine studies was the accessibility of food, with all the studies reporting that economic crisis due to COVID-19 was the main cause of food inaccessibility (Table 3). Two studies [16, 32] confirmed that the usability (quality) of food was reduced during COVID-19 and that food diversity during COVID-19 was less than the food diversity before the emergence of the pandemic. The study from Iran [25] reported that the food diversity (usability/quality) of households had actually increased following COVID-19 and the food security was improved. This was in contrast to the study conducted in Indonesia [32] which indicated that food access, availability, and usability were all compromised by COVID-19.\n\nTwo studies [30, 31] examined food security using prior and following the pandemic emergence food security levels of individuals. Both papers identified the negative impact of COVID-19 on food security, with food security status reduced during the pandemic as compared with the pre-pandemic food security status (Table 4). The remaining eight studies explored COVID-19 related food security using pre- and post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity prevalence.\n\nRisk of reporting bias in reviewed studies\n\nEach reviewed study was assessed using the AHRQ bias assessment criteria. Berkman et al. [28] noted that the reporting of bias assessment outcomes using this tool shall be either “suspected” or “undetected”. If the reviewer cannot identify any reporting bias from studies, it is recommended to say ‘undetected’ than to say ‘free from reporting biases’. Based on this tool (AHRQ), the reporting biases of the majority (9 out of 10) of the reviewed studies were assessed as “undetected” as indicated by the tick “√” symbol in Table 5. The study [36] that used a predictive model for estimating food insecurity was assessed as being “suspected” of bias, as the study was based on the food insecurity data 2–4 years before the occurrence of the pandemic and did not necessarily report on data indicative of the current situation immediately prior to and during the pandemic. Since there might be unidentified food insecurity variation during that longer time period, it was considered potentially problematic to compare the food insecurity during COVID-19 with the situation greater than 2 years prior to the pandemic’s emergence. As a result, the food insecurity report by Kharroubi et al. [36] was suspected of potential bias.\n\nCertainty of evidence\n\nBased on the GRADE Pro handbook the certainty of results was assessed in three modalities (low, very low, moderate, and high). Each study was judged based on the pre-set criteria (Table 6). The study that included pre and post-COVID-19 emergence food security data, identified impacted food security dimension/s, and used collected data instead of estimations was categorised as having a ‘high’ certainty of evidence. The evidence from the majority (9 out of 10) of the studies had high certainty of evidence. The remaining paper [36], which used retrospective data collected 2–4 years before the emergence of COVID-19, was categorised as having low certainty of evidence, particularly considering the influences and multifactored nature of food insecurity.\n\nConceptually, food security is a complex and multifaceted issue [37], with four separate dimensions (food access, availability, usability, and stability) and is influenced by biological, social, and economic factors. As a result of its complexity, it is difficult for all dimensions of food security to be covered with any single food security indicator and a combination of tools should be used to examine the impact of COVID-19’s on food security [37, 38]. The current systematic review was designed to assess the COVID-19 related crisis on food security and associated food dimensions. This was undertaken using a pre-and post-comparative analysis by considering the date of COVID-19 emergence as the reference point. The main findings from this systematic review are presented below.\n\nFood insecurity due to COVID-19\n\nNine of the included studies reported that COVID-19 negatively affected food security and reported reduced food security status [30, 31] or increased food insecurity prevalence [16, 18, 32,33,34,35,36]. These articles noted that food security reduction in the form of four food security modalities (high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security) [9, 16, 35, 39]. In contrast to the other papers, the study conducted in Iran [25] reported that COVID-19 had a positive impact by increasing the food security and dietary diversity of households. The authors of this study [25] justified that the food security and dietary diversity improvement during COVID-19 was due to free food supplements to vulnerable groups, extending e-marketing, delivering nutrition advice, and governmental and non-governmental donations to the people, during the pandemic.\n\nThe largest food insecurity increase (44%) due to COVID-19 was observed in Uganda followed by Kenya [16] with a 38% food insecurity prevalence difference pre-and post-pandemic. This food insecurity prevalence was considered to be largely due to the rural–urban marketing channel disturbance of fresh food products like fish, meat, and vegetables [16]. Except the study conducted in Iran [25], other studies indicated that food security was reduced during COVID-19, with reported figures of 17% in Indonesia [32], 11% in Mexico [33], 19% in Chile [34], 31% in Bangladesh [35], 12% in Lebanon [36], and 8.4% in the USA [18]. In two studies, food security was reduced by 15.7% [34] and 3.34% [30] due to COVID-19 in the United States of America. The economic crisis due to COVID-19, increased unemployment [39], food value chain disturbances [40, 41], marketing channel interruptions [42, 43], and food service provider (hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and retailers) closures [44] were mentioned as the main constraints of food security during COVID-19. These findings would indicate that proactive planning to facilitate more immediate intervention measures by governmental and non-governmental organizations toward food security resilience are needed for future pandemics [25].\n\nThe compromised food security dimension\n\nThe majority (9 out of 10) of the included studies confirmed that the most affected food security dimension was food access, which is consistent with other research [9, 45] that identified food access as being substantially impacted. It is acknowledged that the included studies didn’t use equivalent methods that equally measure all four of the food security dimensions, and this may have led to some diversity in data. Nonetheless, there was a consistent theme across the majority of papers. It was argued that food inaccessibility was primarily due to the poor economic capacity of consumers. This is not surprising; however, it is worth highlighting that physical food inaccessibility was also considered a result of lockdowns which led to a reduction in food access [30,31,32,33].\n\nIn addition to food accessibility, the availability of food [32, 33], and usability/quality of food [16, 32] were reported as being compromised due to COVID-19. The effect of COVID-19 on food usability was considered to be compromised due to a reduction in food diversity. Specifically, one paper [32] identified that three food security dimensions (accessibility, availability, and usability) were affected due to the restrictions and measures applied for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once food accessibility or availability is compromised, food stability/sustainability is impacted by default [24, 46]. Lockdown measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were identified as the main factor for this reduction in food security [47], and this one aspect of food security impacted the entire food system chain [23].\n\nLimitation of the reviewed studies and the review process\n\nThe studies did not necessarily take into account any potential confounding factors, such as illnesses other than COVID-19 [48], natural disasters during COVID-19 (desert locusts in Kenya, Uganda, and Lebanon, and floods in Bangladesh) [49], and climate change at the time of the pandemic [50]. Such factors will also have contributed to the reduction of food security and can therefore obscure the real effect of COVID-19. It is also worth recognising that experience-based food security measures are usually subject to recall biases [51]. Since the included studies used cross-sectional study designs, it is not possible to establish trends of food insecurity developments and to prioritise potential interventions.\n\nDue to time constraints, only primary research articles were included, with brief reports, unpublished studies, reviews, and studies published in languages other than English excluded. This approach to study selection might have excluded relevant literature. This is important as the time delay from doing a study until results are presented in a journal may have meant that potentially relevant papers relating to a recent issue, such as COVID-19, had not yet had sufficient time to be published. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the initial selection system using title and abstract can also be prone to potentially missing relevant studies [52].\n\nThe food security of households and individuals was severely compromised due to COVID-19 emergence. The health, agriculture and socio-economic crises following the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted food security as compared with the pre-pandemic situations. The food accessibility dimension of food security was mainly impacted due to the pandemic. Contrary to the pandemic’s negative impact, integrated food aid interventions by private sectors, and governmental and non-governmental organizations improved food security during COVID-19. Based on this conclusion, the following recommendations were forwarded.\n\nBalancing COVID-19 prevention and food security crises\n\nTo implement either localised or widespread COVID-19 restrictions, such as transport bans, lockdowns, food market chain restrictions, and quarantine, the benefits should outweigh any problems that arise. This is particularly relevant for disadvantaged groups, particularly in low-income countries, where circumstances characterised by ‘hand to mouth’ meant entire communities cannot easily cope with any new food security crises, such as those arising due to COVID-19 prevention measures [53]. Therefore, any COVID-19 prevention restrictions should consider these social groups and balance the positives of reduced COVID-19 transmission arising from such restrictions, against the detrimental impact associated with food security [54].\n\nDecisions that are unidirectionally focused (i.e. focusing on health crisis only) and implemented hastily without due consideration to all possibly factors, may have a catastrophic impact on food security. Unless these decisions are made in integrated manner (for instance in a ‘one health’ approach), emerging crises due to food insecurity might be as devasting as the personal health impact directly from COVID-19. Participating multi-disciplinary professionals, facilitating emergency food aid and SafetyNet programs, and prioritizing the pros and cons of COVID-19 prevention measures before implementation, should all be considered as potential strategies for balancing COVID-19’s prevention measures and arising food security crises.\n\nIntegrated food security interventions\n\nFood insecurity, arising either directly from the pandemic or indirectly due to restrictions applied for its prevention and control, should be mitigated by integrated interventions that are coordinated by governmental and non-governmental organisations, individuals, and institutions. Food security interventions can reduce mortality associated with food insecurity while balancing the need for COVID-19 prevention restrictions [55]. Although the data is limited, the food security crises during COVID-19 appear to be higher in low- and middle-income countries when compared to high-income countries. Therefore, along with the integrated COVID-19 prevention, collaborative food security intervention between countries is recommended as a proactive strategy to alleviate future problems associated with pandemics [56]. There was stepwise food insecurity increments in households with children [33]. Based on this food insecurity trend, it is recommended that food security actors (like food suppliers, aid and agricultural organizations) prioritise households with children. Households and individuals who were vulnerable for food security crises, including those with lower income, unemployed household member, female-leaded household, households with more children, and household members with lower educational level, are particularly highlighted for urgent intervention areas [34].\n\nSupporting food security resilience\n\nThis systematic review found that food security was severely affected by COVID-19. This compromised food security needs to be supported to recover, and communities that experience food insecurity should be proactively assisted to overcome both immediate and emerging crises. To achieve food security resilience, communities needed to be provided with the tools and resources to be more independent. Unless cooperative food insecurity resilience is applied, the vulnerable groups\' morbidity and mortality due to food insecurity will be exacerbated [57].\n\nFuture implications\n\nThere is currently a lack of comparative data examining food security pre and post-COVID-19 emergence, and a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues can only be achieved with a greater focus on these areas. Studies regarding the effect of post-pandemic restrictions on food security, determining the vulnerable groups for food insecurity, identifying the food security resilience methods during and after COVID-19, and investigating the merits and emerging problems arising from COVID-19 prevention measures are all recommended topics for consideration in prospective studies. Considering the limitations of included studies, it is also suggested that future research should consider and evaluate the multiple food security driving factors external to COVID-19 that might increase the food security crisis.\n\nRegistration and protocol\n\nThis systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registrations number: CRD42022325475.

And like countless other migrants, they were forced to move home to the countryside to cut down on expenses.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that 97 million people across the globe fell into poverty due to the pandemic in 2020, living on less than $2 a day.\n\nThere has been little improvement since. “Globally, the increase in poverty that occurred in 2020 due to Covid still lingers, and the Covid-induced poor in 2021 continues to be 97 million people,” economists at the World Bank said in a blog post earlier this year. They noted, however, that overall poverty should go down this year.\n\n“We barely had enough to return home,” Dipali Roy said in an interview in Bengali from the family’s home, a corrugated metal shack in a village in northern Bangladesh.\n\nAs the couple looked for new ways to earn a living, they struggled to adjust. They tried to find a loan to start a small business, but at first no one was able or willing to help. Some local nonprofitorganizations asked for collateral, which they didn’t have.\n\nHoping to land a job in agriculture, Pradip Roy approached some farmers. But he was dismissed as a “Dhaka man,” who wouldn’t be able to cope in harsh weather conditions, recounted his wife.\n\nAbove all, “food was the biggest problem,” said20-year-old Dipali Roy, who was pregnant at the time and sometimes could only have one meal a day through a public rationing program. “I didn’t know what to do … We would just have to sit and wait when they would bring food.”\n\n2020 led to a historic setback in the fight against global poverty, with the number of the world’s poorest rising for the first time in over 20 years, according to the World Bank.\n\nCarolina Sánchez-Páramo, global director of poverty and equity at the World Bank, likened the pandemic to a natural disaster that would quickly spread beyond its epicenter in East Asia.\n\n“We knew the tsunami was coming,” she told CNN Business.\n\n“The question was not if this [economic shock] was going to reach the other developing regions, but when.”\n\nRising inequality\n\nEven as tens of millions of people were being pushed into destitution, the ultra-rich becamewealthier.Last year, billionaires enjoyed the highest boost to their share of wealth on record, according to the World Inequality Lab.\n\nAnd while it took just nine months for the world’s 1,000 richest people to reclaim their fortunes during the pandemic, it could be more than a decade before the least fortunate recover, according to Oxfam International’s annual inequality report, released in January.\n\nShameran Abed, executive director of BRAC International, a nonprofit that works to alleviate poverty across Asia and Africa, pointed to the widening wealth gap, saying that “the world’s three richest people” could likely wipe out ultra poverty on Earth.\n\n“It’s not their responsibility alone,” he added. “But I’m just saying that generally there’s enough resources [to tackle the problem].”\n\nRecently, the top 1% has been under pressure to pitch in on humanitarian issues.\n\nIn November, the director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme called on billionaires including the world’s two richest men, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to “step up now, on a one-time basis.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson, David Beasley said that giving $6 billion, or about 2% of Musk’s net worth, could help solve world hunger.\n\n“[It’s] $6 billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” he added.\n\nThe call-out got a direct response from Musk, who later said on Twitter that if the organization could lay out “exactly how” the funding would solve the issue, he would “sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”\n\nThe Tesla (TSLA) CEO did not publicly respond when the UN released a plan in November.\n\nWhat’s needed now\n\nAbed, who recently worked with members of parliament in the United Kingdom to declare an “emergency” on the issue, argues that “poverty is a policy choice.”\n\n“We have the know-how to pull large amounts of people out of poverty,” said the nonprofit leader, whose team helped the Roys with a loan that the couple said got them back on their feet.\n\n“There’s plenty of evidence of what works, what doesn’t work.”\n\nExperts say the first task is to concentrate on vaccinations.\n\n“We need to make sure that everybody has access to vaccines or some sort of treatment for the pandemic, because till you manage to control the health shock, it’s very hard to think about economic recovery right?” said Sánchez-Páramo. “That’s almost like a necessary condition for anything else to happen.”\n\nVaccine inequality has become a major issue as many of the world’s richest countries hoard shots, buying up enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over and failing to deliver on their promises to share them with the developing world.\n\nAnd as governments continue to rebuild, theyshould also focus on reactivating economic activity that would generate employment, such as in the service sector, according to Sánchez-Páramo.\n\nOver the past two years, governments around the world have rolled out stimulus packages to help prop up their respective economies.\n\nSánchez-Páramo noted that while many have since come under “fiscal pressure” over how much they spent, it was important not to roll back safety net programs too quickly.\n\n“They [should] wait for employment to recover before they withdraw income support from some of these more vulnerable households,” she said.\n\n“Because if we consolidate and roll back the support too quickly, we may actually see a second wave of increases in poverty because the employment is not yet there.”\n\nGlimmers of hope\n\nBack in Bangladesh, the Roys are having better days.\n\nAfter securing a loan of 40,000 taka ($466), the couple purchased a van and a goat to support themselves, they said.\n\nPradip Roy now works as driver with his van, ferrying passengers for the equivalent of about $6 a day. He said the family has no plans to return to the city, and is now saving up to buy a cow and some agricultural land.\n\nWhile the two have technically climbed out of poverty, the hardships of the coronavirus crisis have made their mark.\n\nDipali Roy, who described the pangs of hunger while she was pregnant as “the most painful” time of her life, said “if I think back to, or remember those times, my heart bursts with tears.”\n\n“But now we are having very good days,” she added, saying that she had regained hope for the future, and dreams that their six-month-old son will go on to get a master’s degree.\n\nStill, they have a reminder for the international community: do not forget those still left behind.\n\n“There are a lot of people like us who fell to the bottom,” said Pradip Roy. “So if you stand beside them they can also rise back up like us, slowly.”\n\n— Esha Mitra in New Delhi and Ivana Kottasová in London contributed to this report.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10537013/', 'Headline': 'The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Weight Loss, Eating Behaviour and ...', 'Snippet': '1.

In addition to the direct impact of the virus on people’s health, local lockdowns, recommendations to self-isolate, and disrupted travel and trade routes, have resulted in people losing their jobs, food shortages, and food prices increasing1,2. This perfect storm of reduced access to, and availability and affordability of, food has resulted in increased food insecurity (defined as existing when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”3, in both higher and lower-income countries4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn this paper, taking advantage of multiple waves of High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) of households undertaken since the pandemic started, linked to ongoing panel micro studies, we undertake the first multi-country, multi-period analysis of the evolution of food insecurity in lower-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of the governments of the 11 countries included in our analysis has implemented restrictions that include school closures, travel restrictions, and bans on public gatherings, to contain the spread of the virus10. While the stringency of the government responses were highest during March and April 2020 (in the early stages of the pandemic), some countries such as Djibouti and Mali started to relax their restrictions around July 2020. However, most of the sample countries continued to impose at least some restrictions until the end of 2020. With the rise of COVID-19 cases in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 1 in the Appendix), a number of countries re-imposed restrictions (Fig. 1). Countries have also implemented policies aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the pandemic and the restrictive policies, including emergency investments in healthcare facilities, and new forms of social welfare provision. We particularly focus on the policy interventions undertaken by governments to try to reduce the impact of the pandemic on food insecurity, including the use of food and cash safety nets.\n\nSocial safety nets have long been implemented by governments to protect poor and vulnerable people and improve socioeconomic conditions, and have been highlighted as being particularly important for vulnerable populations affected by negative shocks7,11,12. Government-funded safety nets are common across sub-Saharan Africa, indeed they can be found in every African country13. The explicit link between safety nets and food security, whether in higher or lower-income countries, is well documented in the literature14. Though there is a multitude of different safety nets, two common safety nets employed across many countries are cash transfer programmes and food-based programmes that can variously include providing food, food stamps, food vouchers, and food for work programmes13.\n\nA key debate in the literature, and among policy circles, is the extent to which cash or food assistance has most impact in reducing food insecurity15. Naturally, public nutrition programmes and food safety nets more broadly are designed to directly reduce food insecurity. Yet from a utility-maximising perspective, cash transfers tend to be considered to be more economically efficient because, at the margin, they do not distort consumption and production choices16,17,18. Further, cash transfers are often cheaper administratively18. There are also non-economic reasons for preferring cash to food transfers, such as that they are less “paternalistic”15,19.\n\nDespite theoretical and non-economic rationales for preferring cash to food transfers, there is a considerable body of empirical evidence that, in higher-income countries, in-kind transfers such as food stamps improve household food consumption more than cash transfers15. In lower-income countries, increasingly researchers are using randomised controlled trials, experiments, and regression analysis, to explore empirically whether cash or in-kind transfers are most effective at reducing food insecurity. As such, contextual evidence takes precedence over theoretical underpinnings.\n\nOur empirical findings suggest that safety nets in the form of cash assistance are more likely to reduce the chances of food insecurity among households over time. However, food assistance fails to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity. Further, households with female and/or relatively less-educated heads, and those that are poorer or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, have a higher chance of suffering food insecurity. We also show that households that were unable to rely on their savings and had to borrow to make ends meet were also more likely to suffer from food insecurity during the pandemic. As such, our paper shows the importance of understanding the socioeconomic underpinnings of COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, heterogeneities in findings across countries reveal the need for evidence-based policies tailored to local contexts.\n\nData\n\nIn collaboration with international agencies including the European Commission, World Bank, and USAID, High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have been conducted in a number of countries (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/hfps). Many of these surveys are linked to ongoing household surveys and aim to collect information on loss of employment and income, health and wellbeing, impact on education of children, food (in)security, coping strategies adopted, and safety net disbursements. Summaries of these datasets, that we use in this study, are provided in Table 1.\n\nWe use these high-Frequency Phone Survey data on COVID-19 to track the impacts of the pandemic within and across countries. We present and analyse data from eleven countries. Specifically, we look at the following four indicators of household food insecurity from the survey questionnaire:\n\n1.\n\nHave you or any other adult in your household had to skip a meal in the last 30 days?\n\n2.\n\nDid the household go without eating for a whole day in the last 30 days?\n\n3.\n\nDid you or any other adult in your household run out of food in the last 30 days?\n\n4.\n\nWere you or any other member in your household hungry but did not eat in the last 30 days?\n\nAlthough there is considerable consistency across countries with respect to the indicators of food insecurity, coverage does vary from country to country. Whereas, for example, Malawi and Nigeria, at the time of writing, had each conducted seven waves, Armenia had only conducted one. Further, within these waves, some countries have consistently asked all four dimensions of food insecurity, whereas others have either only asked a subset, or have not asked the same questions consistently across waves.\n\nEstimation strategy\n\nWe use a fixed-effects linear probability model (Equation 1) to investigate the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic for each country using household-level data over multiple waves for each of the food insecurity questions:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} y_{it} = \\delta X_{it} + \\phi Z_{it} + \\theta C_{it} + \\alpha _{i} + \\gamma _{t} + \\epsilon _{it} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\( y_{it}\\) is a binary outcome for household i in wave t in response to a specific food insecurity related question. \\(\\delta X_{it}\\) is a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as education and gender, loss of household income compared to pre-pandemic levels/poverty status of households in the case of Chad, Djibouti, and Mali (income data are not available for these countries). In terms of safety nets, we control for whether a household has received cash or food benefits and, where this breakdown is unavailable, we control for whether a household has benefited from any safety net (\\(\\phi Z_{it}\\) is a vector of safety nets). To investigate whether the impact of safety nets on the probability of households suffering from food insecurity varies over time, interaction terms between the safety net variables and wave dummies are included. Because affordability of food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security, we include an additional dummy variable indicating whether the prices of major food items increased during the pandemic. We include two interaction terms; (1) increase in price and loss in income, and (2) increase in price and poverty status, to investigate whether increases in prices of major food items have a differential impact on food insecurity. \\(\\theta C_{it}\\) is a vector controlling for coping strategies that households have adopted during the pandemic: reliance on savings; and borrowing from friends, family, non-government organisations. Finally, we include sub-national and wave fixed-effects to control for unobserved heterogeneities (such as seasonality) across space and time. We use the sampling weights reported in the surveys.\n\nGovernment restrictions and consequent disruptions\n\nThe Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) reports stringency of governments’ policies and interventions to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such measures might variously include school closures, travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings, emergency investments in healthcare facilities, new forms of social welfare provision, contact tracing and other interventions, and augmentation of health systems10. The index of stringency of these measures during the time period that the surveys in this paper were conducted is presented in Fig. 1. A clear pattern emerges. All 11 countries included in this paper rapidly transitioned from no restrictions at the start of 2020 to very high levels of restrictions by April 2020. Though stringency measures started to be relaxed from May 2020, most of the countries continued to impose considerable restrictions throughout the time period in consideration. Government stringency measures likely affected food security through a number of different channels, including loss of income where household members could not go to work20; and increasing food prices due to disruption of supply chains21, both of which we control for in our econometric analysis. The OxCGRT index is only available at the country-level, and not at the sub-national level. However, we control for sub-national heterogeneity in government restrictions by including regional fixed-effects and the changes in the stringency measures through the wave fixed-effects.\n\nFood insecurity and safety nets during the pandemic\n\nThe data from the multiple waves demonstrate how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic. We present key descriptive statistics for each of the countries (Fig. 2). Some countries with multiple waves of data reveal clear trends across time. For example, in Nigeria and Uganda, across multiple dimensions, food security appears to be improving over time. In contrast, in Malawi, South Africa, and Chad, there is no clear pattern of improvement. These national level data hide sub-national trends, the richness of which are revealed in the country maps (Figures 3–10 in the Appendix).\n\nWhilst most countries report whether assistance is cash or food, two, Kenya and Armenia, only report government assistance in general terms, and some countries report three different categories of assistance. These discrepancies not withstanding, the data show that the extent and nature of the government safety nets varies considerably across countries (Fig. 3). Some countries, such as Ethiopia, have provided the majority of their population with either cash or food assistance. In other countries, such as Malawi, few households have received any type of government assistance. It should be noted that Chad and Mali have relatively low coverage of safety nets, this may be a government failure or it may be the case that coverage of safety nets is not being tracked. In the next section we undertake a series of econometric analyses to determine the extent to which these safety nets, in addition to other key variables, may have influenced how food insecurity has evolved during the pandemic.\n\nDeterminants of food insecurity\n\nThe econometric results are consistent across the four indicators of food insecurity (panels (a)–(d) in Fig. 4 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Our results show that female-led households generally have a higher chance of food insecurity compared to male-led households. This effect is particularly pronounced in Malawi (for example, skipping a meal: 0.284, 95% CI 0.270, 0.299; going hungry: 0.541, 95% CI 0.516, 0.569). However, there are two exceptions: In Cambodia, having a female head reduces the probabilities of households going without eating for a whole day (panel (b); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4); and Chad, running out of food (panel (c); Fig. 4) and going hungry (panel (d); Fig. 4). The findings also suggest that households with relatively higher educated heads have a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity, suggesting that education continues to play an important role even during a pandemic. The influence of education varies considerably, with the highest benefits with respect to reducing the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Djibouti (− 0.232, 95% CI − 0.221, − 0.244), Ethiopia (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.148, − 0.164), and Nigeria (− 0.156, 95% CI − 0.149, − 0.164); and the lowest in Malawi (− 0.006, 95% CI − 0.005, − 0.007).\n\nFood security is heavily influenced by a household’s ability to afford food. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the households experienced a loss in income, while prices of major food items have increased due to supply side constraints1,2. Our findings show that both these changes have increased households’ probability of suffering from food insecurity. The income effect is particularly strong in Cambodia (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.589, 95% CI 0.561, 0.619), Malawi (highest increase for the probability of “skipping a meal”: 0.274, 95% CI 0.260, 0.289), and Uganda (highest increase for the probability of “going without eating for a whole day”: 0.356, 95% CI 0.339, 0.374). For Chad, Djibouti, and Mali, we have poverty status of households rather than income information. For this group of countries, poverty status has the highest impact on the chances of being “hungry but did not eat” in Mali (0.382, 95% CI 0.364, 0.402), and the lowest in Malawi (0.135, 95% CI 0.129, 0.142). As would be expected, relatively poorer households have higher chances of suffering from food insecurity.\n\nAccording to our results, increases in prices of major food items have significantly affected food security among households across all 11 countries. Households in Ethiopia were particularly affected with respect to increased chance of “going hungry but did not eat” (0.327, 95% CI 0.311, 0.344); and those in Malawi with respect to increased chance of “running out food” (0.424, 95% CI 0.404, 0.444). Both interaction terms, loss of income and price increase dummy, and poverty status and price increase dummy, suggest that households who suffered income loss and relatively poorer households experienced relatively higher increases in the probability of food insecurity due to increases in prices of major food items (the highest effect is found in Mali in terms of increasing the chances of “going hungry but did not eat”: 0.447, 95% CI 0.426, 0.470). Though expected, these findings provide empirical evidence that increases in the prices of food items have a disproportionately higher impact on poorer households.\n\nIn terms of coping strategies, our findings show that households that were able to draw down on savings during the pandemic had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity. Savings were more effective in reducing the probability of “skipping a meal” in Mali (− 0.327, 95% CI − 0.310, − 0.343), even controlling for poverty status of the households, than in other countries. In contrast, households that had to borrow (whether from friends or family or other sources) had a higher chance of experiencing food insecurity. These findings have implications for inequality and distributional impacts of the pandemic, as relatively higher income households are likely to have sufficient savings while poorer households are are likely have to borrow to make ends meet.\n\nDifferential impacts of safety nets\n\nOur findings indicate that cash transfers have been more effective than food transfers in reducing the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). The interaction terms between the safety net dummy variables and wave dummies further suggest that the efficacy of cash transfers improved during the pandemic. For households who received food as a safety net, however, though their probability of suffering from food insecurity also declined, across all countries with relevant data, it remained positive. For Kenya, where we do not have separate information on whether assistance is in the form of cash or food transfers, the results suggest that while safety nets were ineffective in the first wave, they did reduce the probability of food insecurity among household in the second and the third waves (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nThe lower-income countries addressed in this paper have been affected by, and responded to, the COVID-19 pandemic in different and varied ways. However, a number of common patterns emerge from the data that enable us to make several important contributions to the literature addressing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) more broadly. First, we have conducted the first multi-country, multi-time period analysis of the key factors influencing food insecurity during the pandemic. Across 11 countries and up to seven waves of data, we show how a combination of the direct health impacts of the pandemic and government responses restricting movement and trade have resulted in food insecurity that government safety nets have not fully mitigated. Our econometric analysis identifies key socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic. Importantly, we quantify these effects and demonstrate heterogeneity across countries and across food insecurity indicators, highlighting the importance of understanding local contexts. Specifically, households that are female-headed, less-educated, poor or experiencing a pandemic-induced loss of income, or without access to savings are more likely to suffer from food insecurity. These findings are consistent with much of the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity22; and with23 who highlight key socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality. Because the educational background of parents influences their children’s educational, earnings, and wage outcomes24,25, our results further suggest that public investment and policies to improve education are likely to reduce inter-generational inequalities with respect food insecurity during any future crises, including possible future pandemics.\n\nSecond, we also show the differentiated impacts of household coping strategies—specifically savings versus borrowing. Our findings show that households that were able to rely on savings had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity during the pandemic compared to the households that had to borrow, even controlling for poverty or loss of income. This finding is consistent with the literature that suggests that encouraging lower-income households to save will improve food security for the poor, not just in the context of the pandemic, and can build resilience to shocks and mitigate the more severe negative impacts of those shocks26,27,28. Third, our analysis confirms that the observed increases in the prices of major food items have increased the chances of food insecurity across countries, particularly for relatively poorer households and those that have suffered a loss in income.\n\nFinally, and importantly, our differentiated analysis of the efficacy of safety nets over time and across multiple countries demonstrates definitively that during this pandemic, cash assistance has reduced the chances of households suffering from food insecurity over time, whereas food assistance has failed to significantly reduce the probability of food insecurity during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, cash and food assistance have both been shown more broadly to improve food security across various dimensions. However, we recognise that there are other elements of food security, such as nutritional aspects and diet diversity, that we do not address, and that may not be influenced by cash transfers29. Many countries (such as Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa) extended cash support using pre-pandemic information on vulnerability based on poverty status during the pandemic30. Our results support governments designing more targeted policies that take into account local contexts and location specific socioeconomic drivers of food insecurity; and targeting of particularly vulnerable groups including those who may be considered newly vulnerable due to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, a number of countries have expanded cash transfers in a more targeted way, such as to the elderly (Cabo Verde, Mauritania), the disabled (Mauritania and Tunisia), and female-headed households (Mauritania). Further, countries including Madagascar and Sudan provided food assistance specifically to those who relied on daily earning who are particularly affected by government lockdown measures31. Combining these country specific targeted initiatives with our paper’s empirical findings offers guidance for governments as to how to ensure more effective food security outcomes from limited budgets.\n\nOur paper, one of the most comprehensive pieces of research to address food insecurity quantitatively across multiple countries and timescales, has revealed important empirical regularities of relevance to those responsible for improving food and nutrition status in households across lower-income countries. Our research supports the need for appropriately targeted safety nets, designed with an understanding of the specific country and household characteristics, and a broad understanding of food security that takes into account the importance of quality and nutritional content, in addition to quantity.\n\nWe recognise that though the data sets we use for our analysis are nationally representative, they are not directly comparable across countries and time, for example, in terms of the number of waves conducted, nor do they control for any potential seasonality effects. That said, we do control for the wave fixed-effects, and so do pick up seasonality aspects through the time fixed-effects. Furthermore, we do not run a pooled regression, instead the econometric analysis is conducted separately for each country, and therefore the risk of seasonality affecting our results is minimal.\n\nThese important debates over how to best reduce food insecurity tend to flare up during crises, such as pandemics, but are increasingly relevant more broadly given the persistence of food insecurity across LMICs and growing evidence that climate change is resulting in an increase in the number and proportion of under-nourished people across the globe32. As evidence increases that climate change is directly harming food security, government policies will be central to how countries adapt to the realities of climate change, particularly in terms of the likely increases in frequency and severity of shocks, on top of the slow-burn impact of increasing temperatures on crop yields.'}}",91.25,2

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/durham-report-fbi-trump-clinton-2016-campaign-f3039e651eeb35a09091c363419e6766', 'Headline': ""Durham report takeaways: A 'seriously flawed' Russia investigation and ..."", 'Snippet': 'A 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.

Flawed research by a former British spy tasked with a sensitive, and political, assignment. And an FBI scrambling against the election-season clock to untangle suspicions about foreign government collusion that it feared could have grave national security implications.\n\nA 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.\n\nThe findings aren’t flattering for the FBI, with Durham asserting that it rushed into the investigation without an adequate basis and routinely ignored or rationalized evidence that undercut its premise. The report catalogs a series of errors — though many were already documented years ago by a separate Justice Department inspector general report, and the FBI says it’s taken several dozen corrective steps on its own.\n\nA look at some of the major findings of the Durham report.\n\nA ‘SERIOUSLY FLAWED’ INVESTIGATION\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the FBI’s decision to open, on July 31, 2016, an investigation into possible criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe probe was initiated after it learned from an Australian diplomat that a Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos had claimed to know that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. By that point, it was well known that Russian operatives had hacked Democratic emails, and Trump had even appeared to publicly invite Moscow to go looking for Clinton’s communications.\n\nBut, according to Durham, the FBI rushed into the probe without having any evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign had had any contact with any Russian intelligence officers. It identifies by name the Russia experts in the FBI and other agencies who were never consulted before the investigation was begun and says that had they been, they would have said there was no information pointing to a conspiracy between Russia and the campaign.\n\nThe report contends that the FBI fell prone to “confirmation bias,” repeatedly ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing away evidence that undercut the premise of collusion, including a conversation in which Papadopoulos vigorously denied knowing about any cooperative relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt also says investigators did not corroborate a “single substantive allegation” in a dossier of Democratic-funded research that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and yet continued to cite it in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.\n\nBUT DID IT UNCOVER ‘THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY’ AS TRUMP PREDICTED?\n\nNo, it did not. Despite identifying abundant errors, the report and the broader investigation failed to live up to Trump’s hype. The former president claimed that it would reveal the “crime of the century” and expose a “deep state conspiracy” by high-ranking government officials to derail his candidacy and later his presidency.\n\nBut the report yielded only one conviction — a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee — and the only two other cases that were brought both ended in acquittals at trial. And though Durham accused the FBI of confirmation bias, he did not allege that political bias or partisanship were guiding factors for the FBI’s actions.\n\n‘RIGOR, OBJECTIVITY AND PROFESSIONALISM’\n\nThe FBI responded to criticism of its actions by noting that the conduct occurred under different FBI leadership, months before current Director Christopher Wray took the top job. It also said it had already taken dozens of corrective measures designed to prevent the same problems from recurring.\n\nThose include steps designed to ensure the accuracy of applications the FBI files with the secretive surveillance court when it wants to eavesdrop on the communications of suspected spies and terrorists. For instance, the FBI said, agents must now provide more information, including identifying and disclosing evidence that might undercut their premise that probable cause exists for surveillance. In addition, the FBI has worked to improve oversight of confidential human sources.\n\nThe FBI said in a letter to Durham that it was confident that had those steps been in place in 2016, the “failures detailed in your Report never would have happened.” In a separate statement, it said the report “reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.“\n\nWAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TREATED DIFFERENTLY?\n\nYes, Durham argues. He notes that the FBI in 2016 also investigated allegations in the book “Clinton Cash,” authored by a conservative writer who alleged foreign governments were funneling money to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for access. Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and former President Bill Clinton have long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI labeled its reviews linked to “Clinton Cash” as “preliminary investigations,” Durham said. But the Trump Russia probe, he said, “was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information.”\n\nHe argues the FBI showed caution about possibly influencing Hillary Clinton’s campaign that it did not show for Trump’s campaign.\n\nTo underscore his point, he quotes some of the text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose privately expressed dislike for Trump has long been cited as evidence of bias.\n\n“One more thing: (Clinton) may be our next president,” Page is said to have written Strzok. “The last thing you need (is) going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”\n\nAN UPHILL CLIMB IN CONGRESS GETS STEEPER\n\nThe Durham report is another blow to the FBI as it’s trying to persuade Congress that it is a responsible steward of intelligence.\n\nLawmakers are beginning to debate whether to renew a U.S. surveillance program that captures huge swaths of foreigners’ emails and phone calls. The program authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Durham report calls attention to mistakes that Republicans have already cited as reasons for overhauling Section 702. The FBI did not use Section 702 in surveilling Page. But its omissions before the primary surveillance court have long rankled Republicans, who have signaled they won’t renew Section 702 without changes targeting the FBI.\n\n“It is essential that Congress codifies clear guardrails that prevent future FBI abuses and restores the public’s trust in our law enforcement institutions,” said Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement.\n\nA significant number of Democrats, meanwhile, separately want limits on when the FBI can search foreign surveillance data collected under Section 702.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In one instance, according to the report, FBI headquarters and Justice Department officials “required defensive briefings to be provided to Clinton and other officials or candidates who appeared to be the targets of foreign interference.”\n\nIn another, the FBI “elected to end an investigation after one of its longtime and valuable confidential human sources went beyond what was authorized and made an improper and possibly illegal financial contribution to the Clinton campaign on behalf of a foreign entity as a precursor to a much larger donation being contemplated.” And in a third example related to investigating the Clinton Foundation, both senior FBI and DOJ officials “placed restrictions on how those matters were to be handled such that essentially no investigative activities occurred for months leading up to the election.”\n\nDurham also pointed to the “markedly different” handling of the Trump investigation and Clinton’s private email server.\n\nThe special counsel also singled out Marc Elias for criticism. Elias was the Clinton campaign’s general counsel in 2016 and hired the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired Steele. Elias met with Steele in 2016 and periodically briefed the campaign about the findings from Fusion and Steele. The lawyer also coordinated closely with Michael Sussmann, his former Perkins Coie law firm colleague, on anti-Trump research in 2016. Sussmann had been charged by Durham with making false statements. However, he was found not guilty in 2022.\n\nThe dossier and Russian disinformation\n\nDurham said, “Within days of their receipt, the unvetted and unverified Steele Reports were used to support probable cause in the FBI’s FISA applications targeting” targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.\n\nThe special counsel noted: “This was done at a time when the FBI knew that the same information Steele had provided to the FBI had also been fed to the media and others.”\n\n“Our investigation determined that the Crossfire Hurricane investigators did not and could not corroborate any of the substantive allegations contained in the Steele reporting,” Durham wrote. “Nor was Steele able to produce corroboration for any of the reported allegations, even after being offered $1 million or more by the FBI for such corroboration.”\n\nDurham concluded, “Russian intelligence knew of Steele’s election investigation for the Clinton campaign by no later than early July 2016” and “Steele’s sources may have been compromised by the Russians at a time prior to the creation of the Steele Reports and throughout the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”\n\nThe report also said dossier source Igor Danchenko provided Steele with “rumor and speculation.” Durham charged Russian analyst Danchenko. However, he was found not guilty last year.\n\nNo collusion\n\nDurham’s report assessed “neither U.S. law enforcement nor the intelligence community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at the commencement of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” and the FBI then “discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia.”\n\nThe special counsel noted the claims in British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier “would eventually fall apart, but not before it had been continuously adopted by the FBI as supportive of its underlying theory regarding collusion.”\n\nDurham added that when ex-Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke with the special counsel’s office, he: “Advised that he knew of no direct evidence that would meet the legal standard of conspiracy or collusion on Trump’s part.”\n\nThe special counsel also said Adm. Mike Rogers, who served as the director of the National Security Agency during the relevant time period, told them “he did not recall any intelligence that supported the collusion assertions.” Durham also concluded former Obama CIA Director John Brennan similarly likely “had no actual knowledge of such information.”\n\nThe special counsel also pointed out since-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok said in May 2017 he was hesitating to join the Mueller investigation “in part, because of my gut sense and concern there’s no big there there.” Durham wrote: “Although the ‘there’ does not appear to have been explicitly identified, it may well have been a reference to the Russia-Trump collusion investigation.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNo further crimes charged\n\nDurham has obtained one guilty plea during the investigation from FBI ex-lawyer Kevin Clinesmith. Clinesmith pleaded guilty to falsifying a document during the bureau’s efforts to renew FISA surveillance against Carter Page. Durham brought charges against Sussmann and Danchenko but was unsuccessful with both at trial.\n\nThe special counsel didn’t charge anyone else in his new report.\n\n“The law does not always make a person’s bad judgment, even horribly bad judgment, standing alone, a crime. Nor does the law criminalize all unseemly or unethical conduct that political campaigns might undertake for tactical advantage, absent a violation of a particular federal criminal statute,” Durham wrote. “If this report and the outcome of the Special Counsel’s investigation leave some with the impression that injustices or misconduct have gone unaddressed, it is not because the Office concluded that no such injustices or misconduct occurred. It is, rather, because not every injustice or transgression amounts to a criminal offense, and criminal prosecutors are tasked exclusively with investigating and prosecuting violations of U.S. criminal laws.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/hillary-clinton-dnc-fined-by-fec-over-trump-russia-collusion-hoax/', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton, DNC fined by FEC over Trump-Russia collusion hoax', 'Snippet': 'Clinton was fined $8,000 and the DNC was fined $105,000.

The Washington Examiner was first to report the memo on Wednesday.\n\nThe DNC and the Clinton campaign paid over $1 million to the law firm Perkins Coie for information that Fusion GPS had on the dossier, which eventually led to the so-called “Russia hoax.” Both the party and campaign then concealed why they transferred the money, claiming it was for “legal advice and services.”\n\nDespite pushback from the campaign and the DNC, which argued the “legal services” label was appropriate because the money went to Perkins Coie first, the commission determined the groups violated straight-forward election law.\n\n“Solely for the purpose of settling this matter expeditiously and to avoid further legal costs, respondent[s] does not concede, but will not further contest the commission’s finding of probable cause to proceed,” the FEC said.\n\n“This may well be the first time that Hillary Clinton — one of the most evidently corrupt politicians in American history — has actually been held legally accountable, and I’m proud to have forced the FEC to do their job for once,” Dan Backer, who filed the complaint for CRF, told Secrets, as reported by the Examiner. “The Coolidge Reagan Foundation proved that with pluck and grit, Americans who stand with integrity can stand up to the Clinton machine and other corrupt political elites.”\n\n“Hillary Clinton and her cronies willfully engaged in the greatest political fraud in history — destroying our nation’s faith in the electoral process, and it’s high time they were held accountable,” he added. “I hope this is only the beginning.”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump sued Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and a number of other individuals and entities, accusing them of attempting to rig the 2016 U.S. presidential election by fabricating a connection between his campaign and Russia.\n\nFiled in federal court in Florida, the lawsuit alleges “Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot” which “shocks the conscience” of democracy in the United States.\n\n“Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J.

The Special Counsel probe found the FBI had insufficient ..."", 'Full_text': 'The FBI lacked evidence to investigate Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and relied too heavily on tips provided by Mr Trump\'s political opponents to fuel the probe, US Special Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday.\n\nThe report marks the end of a four-year investigation launched in May 2019 when then-Attorney-General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage Crossfire Hurricane inquiry into potential contacts between Mr Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nMr Durham said there were a series of missteps by the FBI and Justice Department as investigators undertook a politically explosive probe in the heat of the 2016 election into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome.\n\nBut the report fell far short of the former president\'s prediction he would uncover the ""crime of the century"".\n\nThat Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump\'s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn his new 306-page report, Mr Durham concluded that US intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any ""actual evidence"" of collusion between Mr Trump\'s campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nHe also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Mr Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor instance, he said Ms Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Mr Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign.\n\n""Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigour towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.""\n\nIn response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time.\n\nThe report criticised the FBI for opening a full-fledged investigation based on ""raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence,"" saying the speed at which it did so was a departure from the norm.\n\nIt said investigators repeatedly relied on ""confirmation bias"", ignoring or rationalising away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.\n\nPolitical implications of report\n\nMr Durham\'s report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney-General Merrick Garland on Friday.\n\nMr Durham and his team cast a broad net, interviewing top officials at the FBI, Justice Department and CIA.\n\nIn his first year on the job, he travelled with Mr Barr to Italy to meet with government officials as Mr Trump himself asked then-Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other leaders to help with the probe.\n\nHis findings are likely to become political fodder for Mr Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Mr Trump\'s retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMr Trump had hoped Mr Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden\'s campaign.\n\nBut Mr Durham\'s investigation has largely failed to produce a meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022.\n\nIn one case Mr Durham brought, a Washington DC jury acquitted Hillary Clinton\'s former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Mr Trump\'s business and a Russian bank.\n\nMr Durham\'s investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI when he was interviewed about the sources of information he provided that became part of a document known as the Steele dossier.\n\nThat document, penned by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Mr Trump\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details — many of which were never substantiated.\n\nAn investigation by the Justice Department\'s inspector general later found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier when it applied for court-approved warrant applications to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nMr Durham did secure a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who was singled out in the inspector general\'s report, for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Mr Page.\n\nMr Durham\'s report echoed many of the concerns the inspector general previously raised about the rigour of the FBI\'s process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\n\nThe FBI has since implemented numerous reforms to the process.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-details-on-2016-russia-probe-prompt-flawed-allegations-of-espionage', 'Headline': 'New

appointed by former Attorney General William Barr to investigate any potential wrongdoing during the 2016 Russia probe.\n\nThe filing relates to a low-level case that Durham has brought against Michael Sussmann, a cybersecurity lawyer who\'d represented the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign. Durham alleges Sussmann lied to the FBI about who his client was during a meeting where Sussmann shared information about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBut in a few extra sentences, Durham\'s filing mentions a second instance where Sussmann tried to raise concerns of a Trump-Russia connection, this time apparently to the CIA. That information came from one of Sussmann\'s clients, technology executive Rodney Joffe.\n\nDurham\'s filing noted that Joffe\'s company, Neustar, had an arrangement to provide security-related work on computer servers, including the White House\'s. But, according to the filing, Joffe used that access to mine Internet data to establish an inference and narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\n\nJoffe has not been charged with any crime.\n\nAll of this has now been spun by conservative media and former President Trump himself to say Sussmann and Joffe were Clinton operatives who were paid to illegally hack into and spy on the Trump campaign and Trump White House.\n\nFormer President Trump wrote: ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""\n\nIn a column this week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage of The New York Times wrote that the entire narrative appeared to be mostly wrong or old news, and its conclusions ""based on a misleading presentation of the facts or outright misinformation.""\n\nCharlie Savage joins me now.\n\nI wonder if you could help us understand just initially how we got to this point, how Durham\'s investigation has morphed into this sort of explosive story in conservative media.\n\nCharlie Savage, The New York Times:\n\nSo, back in the Trump administration, right after Robert Mueller, the Russian special counsel, finished his report, Donald Trump shifted — tried to shift the narrative to or escalated his attempt to shift the narrative to the idea that he was actually a victim of a deep state conspiracy.\n\nAnd his attorney general, Bill Barr, as you mentioned, appointed John Durham, then a U.S. attorney, to be what became another special counsel, a special counsel to investigate the investigation.\n\nAnd the whole idea and expectation then was he was going to prove Trump\'s narrative that there were high-level officials who — in the FBI and the CIA who had essentially framed him for collusion.\n\nBut we\'re almost three years in now, and he has yet to bring any charges against the high-level officials. He has developed two cases against outsiders, and one of them is this Sussmann case. Both of these are merely false statement cases. They\'re not charging a conspiracy.\n\nBut Mr. Durham has used court filings and indictments and so forth, related to these cases to put out large amounts of information that are not directly related to the charges. And this information is imbued with insinuations that there is some kind of vast anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nHe just hasn\'t been able to prove it yet or charge it. It all goes back to Hillary Clinton, is the implication.\n\nCharlie Savage:\n\nThere\'s been this repeated cycle of huge alarmism stoked within right-wing pro-Trump outlets that I don\'t really consider doing the same kind of journalism that I\'m doing sending out the message with the blaring outrage, grievance-stroking headlines that now it\'s been proven they were spying on President Trump.\n\nAnd every time you look at it, it — there\'s less there than meets the eye. But if you don\'t cover it, then that allows the sort of Trump world and his allies to say, aha, you know, the media, they\'re in on it. They\'re covering it up. It\'s a conspiracy. They just won\'t tell the truth.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/may/17/durham-report-criticized-elements-of-fbis-investig/', 'Headline': 'Durham’s report on the Trump-Russia probes, explained', 'Snippet': 'Mueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf ...', 'Full_text': 'The long-awaited findings of Special Counsel John Durham’s May 15 report provide some support to long-standing claims from many conservatives — including former President Donald Trump — that the investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign was overblown and lacked strong evidence.\n\nDurham’s report, based on his investigation that began in 2019, suggested that the FBI acted on unanalyzed, unconfirmed intelligence to move too quickly to open a full investigation, rather than a preliminary one, into the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham didn’t conclude that the FBI shouldn’t have investigated the allegations at all. But his report fell short of bringing a flurry of criminal convictions, which had been predicted to follow the probe of what Trump called ""the crime of the century"" within U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe investigation led to one conviction and two trials, both of which resulted in acquitals. A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty to altering an email from the CIA that was used as evidence when investigators sought court permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nWhat did the more-than-300-page Durham report conclude after investigators conducted more than 480 interviews, served more than 190 subpoenas and reviewed more than 1 million documents? Here’s what we know.\n\nWho is Durham and what was he investigating?\n\nDurham was a special counsel appointed to investigate the FBI’s and Justice Department’s probes into the Trump campaign.\n\nIn 2019, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, assigned Durham to investigate whether the FBI or other government agencies violated the law when looking into possible links between then-presidential candidate Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as a special counsel on the investigation, but Barr kept that appointment secret until December 2020 to avoid interfering with the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA special counsel is a semi-independent attorney tapped to investigate and potentially prosecute a case when it presents a possible conflict of interest for the Justice Department, or ""where it’s deemed to be in the public interest to have someone outside the government come in and take responsibility for a matter,"" The Associated Press reported.\n\nDurham was set to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Trump campaign investigation, which began in summer 2016, and the investigation by special counsel Robert. S. Mueller that began in 2017.\n\nSpecial counsel John Durham, the prosecutor appointed to investigate potential government wrongdoing in the early days of the Trump-Russia probe, leaves federal court in Washington, May 16, 2022. (AP)\n\nDid the Durham report determine that the FBI should have never opened an investigation at all?\n\nDurham’s report suggested that the FBI moved too quickly to open a full investigation, but stopped short of denouncing the FBI’s and Justice Department’s decisions to investigate.\n\nDurham wrote, ""There is no question that the FBI had an affirmative obligation to closely examine"" intelligence provided by the Australian government, which said its diplomats had heard George Papadopoulos, a Trump adviser, make alarming statements related to Russia. Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for lying about his attempts to allegedly connect other Trump campaign staff with officials representing Russia. He was pardoned by Trump near the end of Trump’s presidency.\n\nDurham wrote that it would have been a ""sensible step"" for the FBI to have opened a more narrowly focused preliminary investigation based on that intelligence — which Durham wrote was ""essentially the sole basis cited by the FBI for opening a full investigation.""\n\nPreliminary investigations, he wrote, are constrained by time limits and fewer approved investigation techniques.\n\nDurham’s report also recommended the FBI take additional steps to reform its investigation process. He proposed making an FBI official responsible for challenging the steps taken in politically sensitive investigations.\n\nResponding to the report, the FBI said the conduct Durham examined was the reason agency leadership implemented corrective actions some time ago, although that time period isn’t specifically defined. If such reforms had been in place in 2016, the agency said, the missteps Durham identified could have been prevented.\n\nDid the Durham report vindicate Trump’s claims that the investigation into his campaign was a baseless ""witch hunt""?\n\nDurham\'s report found that the investigation into Trump\'s campaign was triggered by uncorroborated intelligence that should have been scrutinized more intensely before a full investigation was launched.\n\nBut the report did not conclude that the investigation was entirely baseless and illegitimate.\n\nTrump has long referred to the investigation into potential collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia as a ""witch hunt"" conducted without evidence. The former president has also often claimed that the collusion allegations were a ""hoax.""\n\nDurham’s report supports the underlying elements of Trump’s sometimes-exaggerated claims. Durham concluded that the FBI moved too quickly to open an investigation based on ""raw, unanalyzed, uncorroborated intelligence."" Durham also wrote that the agency had relied significantly on investigative leads provided or funded by Trump’s political opponents — without adequately questioning the motivations of the people providing the information.\n\nDurham emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny and analysis.\n\nWhen the FBI’s initial investigation was opened, ""neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings,"" Durham wrote.\n\nThe report concluded that senior FBI officials ""displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor"" toward the information received. Additionally, Durham wrote that ""apparent confirmation bias"" and ""an over-willingness to rely on information from individuals connected to political opponents"" resulted in investigators acting ""without appropriate objectivity or restraint"" when investigating the Trump-Russia collusion allegations.\n\nDurham’s report emphasized the role of confirmation bias in the investigation, rather than political bias. This meant that as the FBI investigated the Trump campaign, the agency ""discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support"" the collusion narrative, Durham wrote.\n\nThe report did, however, outline how the FBI’s response to allegations about the Trump campaign differed from the agency’s response to similar allegations about the Clinton campaign, including:\n\nThe FBI’s decision not to open an inquiry or have analytical personnel investigate ""intelligence it received from a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin"" to divert attention from her own use of a private email server.\n\nProviding defensive briefings for Clinton and her staff when, during her 2016 presidential campaign, it had gathered evidence that foreign operatives were working to gain influence with her campaign. No defensive briefings were provided to the Trump campaign based on the Australian diplomat’s intelligence.\n\nDurham’s report is not the first criticism of the FBI’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A 2019 report by the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the FBI for ""serious performance failures"" during the investigation. Still, that report concluded that the agency acted without political bias and was justified in opening its investigation.\n\nDid the report clear Trump of ‘all wrongdoing’?\n\nDurham wasn’t tasked with clearing Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nDurham was asked to determine whether the FBI or others violated the law while investigating the Trump campaign.\n\nAfter the report was released, Trump’s allies and supporters claimed on social media that it exonerated Trump and cleared him of ""ALL wrongdoing."" But that wasn’t the purpose of Durham’s investigation. He was investigating the investigators, not Trump’s conduct.\n\nMueller’s investigation, not Durham’s, culminated in a 2019 report that cleared the Trump campaign of allegations that it conspired with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf or the numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia amounted to criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.\n\nMueller’s report detailed numerous occasions on which Trump tried to impede that investigation, but Mueller ultimately declined to say whether Trump’s actions obstructed justice. Barr concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Trump for obstruction.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, announced May 15 that he invited Durham to testify at a hearing May 25.\n\nPolitiFact Staff Writer Loreben Tuquero contributed to this report.'}}",92.91666666666667,2

NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein was there and joins us now. Hey, Andrea.\n\nANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: OK, so it sounds like Trump got some backup for his defense today.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes. Trump\'s lawyers called, as their penultimate witness, Dr. Eli Bartov, a highly credentialed accounting professor from New York University who had once served as an expert witness for the New York attorney general\'s office.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter) OK.\n\nBERNSTEIN: And Bartov just jumped right in saying, quote, ""there is no evidence whatsoever for accounting fraud."" He sounded like a classroom professor, repeating phrases and saying things like parts of the attorney general\'s complaint, quote, ""border on the absurd"" and that, quote, ""no valuations are objective because they are, by definition, opinions."" He added, if somebody tells you an evaluation is objective, they need to have their head examined. And the witness said that a disclaimer in Trump\'s statements of financial condition makes it clear that no one should take them at face value, and this was so obvious even his 9-year-old granddaughter could understand.\n\nCHANG: Interesting testimony. OK, so how did the AG\'s office respond to all of that?\n\nBERNSTEIN: They really wanted to make it clear that Professor Bartov is not an expert in banking or real estate valuations. At one point, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace objected saying, quote, ""this is pure speculation from somebody they hired to say whatever they want,"" at which point Bartov turned to Wallace and said, quote, ""you should be ashamed. You make up allegations, and you say I say whatever I want. You should be ashamed of yourself talking to me like that,"" which is, of course, highly unusual...\n\nCHANG: (Laughter).\n\nBERNSTEIN: ...For a witness. This was right before lunch. And I did catch Trump lawyer Alina Habba smiling as she turned to leave.\n\nCHANG: And am I understanding this correctly? Trump stayed all day to hear this witness.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Yes, even though it got quite repetitive. Trump knows that when he\'s in the courtroom, we, the press, are there. And we heard Professor Bartov saying the kinds of things that Trump likes to say like, I\'ve never seen a financial statement that provided so much detail. And then, of course, there are all those TV cameras out in the hallway capturing Donald Trump\'s words when he leaves and when he says things like, he should be in Iowa campaigning. Now, of course, he could be in Iowa. He is here fully by his own choice.\n\nCHANG: So what\'s next for Trump in this trial?\n\nBERNSTEIN: So in action outside of this courtroom, Trump got some relief today when an appeals court panel affirmed a judge\'s decision from earlier this fall that the dissolution of Trump\'s business would remain on hold until this trial is over. You might remember that before the trial even began, the judge found on one cause of action for the attorney general and said that Trump would have to start canceling his business certificates. But that was paused.\n\nAnd Trump has also lost his efforts, so far, to overturn a gag order that prevents him from disparaging the judge\'s clerk. Trump\'s lawyers had complained that this violated Trump\'s First Amendment rights, but both the trial judge and an appeals panel have ruled otherwise, which means when Trump testifies on Monday, he won\'t be able to go after the judge\'s clerk from the witness stand. That\'ll be the last day of the defense case - after that, a day of rebuttal, followed by briefs and final arguments in court in January; sometime mid-next-month, maybe just before or after the Iowa caucuses, a verdict.\n\nCHANG: A lot coming up.

When questioned by lawyers for the state of New York about who was paying him, Bartov replied that his bank statements showed some of the money was paid by the Trump Organization and some came from Trump\'s Save America PAC.\n\nThe discussion of Bartov\'s compensation came shortly after one of Trump\'s attorneys, Alina Habba, expressed her frustration to Judge Engoron about objections made by the attorney general\'s team.\n\n""Why are we wasting our time if no one is listening to the words coming out of our experts\' mouths?"" Habba asked.\n\nAnother expert witness for the defense, Frederick Chin, who testified earlier in the week on real estate valuation, admitted that he billed $850 per hour for 1,000 hours of work, totaling $850,000. The state\'s only expert witness, Michael McCarty, acknowledged that he was paid a rate of $950 per hour, but worked far fewer hours, estimating that he made about $350,000 for his testimony.\n\nThese rates provide a glimpse into the high costs of just one of Trump\'s many legal battles, a set of criminal and civil challenges for which the Save America PAC spent $40 million in the first half of this year alone.\n\nTrump stayed at the courthouse all day for Thursday\'s proceedings and periodically spoke outside the courtroom throughout the day, lauding Bartov, an accounting professor at New York University\'s Stern School of Business, and his testimony several times.\n\n""This is a disgraceful situation.

I didn\'t even need the money.""\n\nBartov himself seemed to be a witness tailor-made for the former president in his superlative assessments of Trump\'s financial statements.\n\n""I\'ve never seen a statement that provides so much detail and is so transparent,"" he said. ""The footnotes provide an awesome amount of information.""\n\nThe professor also said that if the statements were turned in as a project in his class, ""they would get an A.""\n\nThe state\'s attorneys expressed skepticism about Bartov\'s findings, leading to some heated moments in the courtroom.\n\n""This is pure speculation from someone that they\'ve hired to say just whatever it is they want in this case,"" attorney Kevin Wallace, a lawyer for the state attorney general, said during an objection to Bartov\'s testimony Thursday.\n\nTrump\'s attorney, Jesus Suarez replied, ""Oh that\'s nasty, man.""\n\n""It is,"" said Wallace.\n\n""Very rude,"" said Suarez.\n\nBartov then shouted at Wallace, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking like that. You make up allegations that never existed. There is no evidence of this.""\n\nIn his testimony, Bartov strongly disputed the grounds of the lawsuit brought by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, saying that from an accounting perspective, it has no merit. He said that Trump\'s use of disclaimers in his financial statements clearly indicated that lenders should do their own due diligence and downplayed discrepancies in the financial statements, explaining that lenders are expected to make their own independent valuations.\n\n""To me, the case isn\'t about valuations. It\'s about statements of financial conditions,"" said Judge Engoron during a tense exchange with Trump\'s attorneys on Friday. ""You can\'t use false statements in business. That\'s what the summary judgment decision was all about. I think it\'s pretty much what the rest of this case was about.""\n\nJudge Engoron ruled before the trial began that Trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud in a partial summary judgment. Trump, his older two sons Donald Jr and Eric, and their company are accused of inflating the value of assets on key financial records to obtain favorable loans and insurance deals. They have denied wrongdoing in the case.\n\nTrump, who already testified last month, was scheduled to return to court on Monday, Dec. 11 but then announced the day before that he will not testify again after all.\n\nCross-examination of Bartov is expected to resume on Tuesday, as this case comes to a close.\n\n— Graham Kates contributed to this report.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-million-dollar-expert-lost-all-credibility-judge-ny-civil-fraud-trial-2023-12-18/', 'Headline': ""Trump's million-dollar expert 'lost all credibility,' judge in civil ..."", 'Snippet': 'An expert witness paid nearly $1 million by Donald Trump to testify at his New York civil fraud trial ""lost all credibility"" by ""doggedly"" justifying the former U.S. president\'s business records ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://whyy.org/articles/donald-trump-new-york-civil-business-fraud-lawsuit-trial-day-4/', 'Headline': 'Evidence at New York fraud trial shows that Trump’s financial ... - WHYY', 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump has said he never thought his yearly financial statements “would be taken very seriously.” But evidence Thursday at his New York civil fraud trial showed the statements were integral to some of his business empire’s loan deals.

Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day ...', 'Full_text': 'Donald Trump made a passionate opening statement, of sorts, on the first day of his fraud trial in New York.\n\nThe former president was not giving evidence - instead, he stopped just outside the courtroom to address reporters before the historic hearing began.\n\nAfter a few stern looks at the camera, he launched into a lengthy preview of what his lawyers are expected to argue during the civil case again him, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization.\n\nHe also lobbed accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud charges and is seeking a fine of $250m (£207m), and Judge Arthur Engoron who already ruled last week that Mr Trump and his business had committed fraud.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at seven of Mr Trump\'s claims.\n\n1. There were no victims\n\nThis is very important to Mr Trump. He believes there should be no case because ""there was no crime"".\n\n""No bank was affected. No bank was hurt,"" he said moments before the start of the trial, noting that all his loans were paid back on time.\n\nUnder this New York statute, however, the attorney general did not have to show that there were victims, only that Mr Trump committed ongoing fraud.\n\n2. The case was timed to damage Trump\'s 2024 campaign\n\n""This trial was railroaded and fast-tracked,"" the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination said. ""This trial could have been brought years ago, but they waited until I was right in the middle of my campaign.""\n\nMr Trump has cast this trial, as well as other lawsuits and indictments, as an attempt to hurt his bid to return to the White House next year.\n\nBut the investigation into these fraud claims began four and a half years ago, when Trump was still president, after his former fixer Michael Cohen went public with the Trump Organization\'s accounting practices.\n\nJudge Engoron reminded Mr Trump\'s lawyer on Monday that the judge has already dismissed claims the lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\n3. Trump was denied a jury\n\nAfter the judge\'s ruling last week, Mr Trump made this claim in a social media post, suggesting to supporters that he had been denied a trial and a jury, and therefore robbed of justice.\n\nOn Monday in court, the judge made a point to say that ""nobody asked"" for a jury trial.\n\nBench trials are not unheard of, and it means the judge alone will decide liability and penalties in the remaining six claims.\n\n4. The \'corrupt\' justice department is behind this\n\nTo fit the case into his wider ""witch hunt"" rhetoric, Mr Trump claimed that Ms James was corrupt, and that she was coordinating with and taking orders from the US Department of Justice.\n\n""It\'s all run by DOJ, which is corrupt, in Washington - everything goes through them,"" he alleged.\n\nHe has shown no evidence of coordination. Also, this is a civil fraud case based on New York state laws, not a federal one. The Justice Department has no jurisdiction here.\n\n5. The \'buyer beware clause\' renders contracts useless\n\nMr Trump pushed this rather unorthodox argument while speaking to reporters on Monday. His businesses\' financial statements have a clause that Mr Trump calls a ""buyer beware"" warning, a disclaimer he said means ""do not believe anything"".\n\nMr Trump says that putting a ""full disclaimer"" in financial statements, ""immediately takes you out of any fraud situation and any litigation"".\n\nBut the judge was clear in his ruling last week that these are non-party disclaimers from his former accounting firm Mazars, and that they do not insulate him from liability.\n\nThose disclaimers also plainly state that ""Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement…""\n\n6. The judge undervalued Trump properties\n\nIn an unusual step, the judge has already ruled that Trump properties were worth less than the former president and his company stated. That was part of a summary judgement delivered last week.\n\n""What he did - undervaluing these properties - is a disgrace to our nation,"" Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\nHowever, it was not Judge Engoron who came up with the valuations. The ones he cited in his ruling were from official assessors.\n\nTake Mar-a-Lago, for example, the former president\'s Florida resort. It was the Palm Beach County assessor - not the judge - that appraised the market value of Trump\'s primary residence at between $18m-$27.6m (£14.5m-£22.5m).\n\nMr Trump continues to claim it is probably worth 50 to 100 times more.\n\n7. Trump did not include his brand in his valuations\n\nMr Trump is not usually shy about telling the world how much his brand is worth.\n\nIn his comments before the trial, however, Mr Trump insisted it had not been factored into the valuations of various properties that are at the heart of this fraud case.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/we-are-not-here-to-hear-what-he-has-to-say-judge-in-trump-fraud-case-loses-his-temper-and-ex-president-sarcastically-feigns-shock-during-very-unfair-trial-in-new-york-city/', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testimony in NY fraud trial: Key moments - Law & Crime', 'Snippet': 'Former president Donald Trump took the witness stand on Monday in his ongoing New York civil fraud trial to answer a series of questions about fraudulent financial documents filed over the course of several years in order to keep his namesake business empire humming and flush with cash.

During the course of his testimony, Trump frequently took the opportunity to offer his own opinions about the case.\n\nTrump’s Monday appearance before the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan marks his second time in the witness box during the proceedings being overseen by Justice Arthur Engoron. In late October, Trump was asked to testify about prior comments he made on social media about the judge’s law clerk. After offering an excuse, Engoron found the witness “not credible” and warned him not to make such comments again.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the 45th president’s first foray into giving under-oath answers actually germane to the long-running lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\n1. The judge offered himself as a punching bag\n\nKevin Wallace led the questioning for the attorney general’s office and early on gave Trump a lot of leeway to elaborate on his answers. But that leeway quickly led to a judicial upbraiding.\n\nAfter one question, Trump downplayed the importance banks paid to his financial statements, saying bankers were typically more interested in securing the overall deals with the Trump Organization.\n\n“They just weren’t a very important element in a bank’s decision-making process, and we’ll explain this as this very crazy trial goes along,” the witness said, according to a courtroom report by MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nIn response to the characterization of the trial, Engoron told Trump not to give speeches during his answers. In response to that, Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise complained that the questions were open-ended and arguably called for a narrative response.\n\nAfter moving on to one of the specific contested financial statements, Trump acknowledged the document in question assigns responsibility for its accuracy to himself – but said if there were any issues, they would have or should have been caught by his accounting firm. Asked further to explain what, if anything, he personally did to ensure the accuracy of such documents in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Trump began to speechify again.\n\nRemarking that the financial statements were signed off on too long ago for him to remember, the witness complained that the vintage of those forms also brings them well outside the statute of limitations. Then, he criticized the judge directly, saying: “I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me,” according to a courtroom report by The Messenger’s Adam Klasfeld.\n\nIn response, Engoron said it was not true that he always rules against Trump, asked Kise if the criticism was necessary, and then spoke to Trump directly: “You can attack me – you can do whatever you want. But please just answer the questions.”\n\n2. The witness concedes the valuations were off\n\nThe crux of the matter before the court are inflated valuations of properties owned by Trump and the Trump Organization. In late September, buoyed by thousands of pages of exhibits filed by the attorney general’s office, Engoron determined that many financial statements filed by Trump and his family’s business empire were fraudulent – deciding a motion of summary judgment in the state’s favor.\n\nSeveral ancillary issues, however, remain – including the amount of the disgorgement, or fine, that the Trump Organization must pay – along with various other potential penalties. And, key to many of the extant legal issues left for the court to determine is the intent and culpability of other named defendants. In other words, the judge is currently assessing who, exactly, was responsible for the fraud – and, the extent to which that fraud was willingly committed in violation of New York State law governing for-profit organizations.\n\nTrump, for his part, conceded that several valuations were incorrect – in both directions – but insisted those weren’t material to the deals he was making and, in any event, couldn’t be considered fraud.\n\n“Do you remember thinking some of those valuations were off?” Wallace asked the witness.\n\nIn response, he said, Mar-a-Lago was “very underestimated.” He added that he personally felt his properties on 40 Wall Street and a golf course in Miami were also undervalued but didn’t raise an issue with how those values were reflected on the documents because he “didn’t care.”\n\nTrump also replied that in his opinion, an apartment in the Trump Tower in Manhattan was overvalued, but that it only takes one person to pay the asking price and buy it for the value to be valid.\n\n“I think I was certainly more expert than anyone else, so if somebody would ask me or if I had an opinion, I would give it,” he reportedly said.\n\n3. The judge snapped at Trump and his attorneys – and Trump’s attorneys snapped back\n\nAs for opinions, Trump had a lot to share on the stand – eventually annoying the court by giving longwinded answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nIn response to one question, Trump gave a sarcastic caricature of the attorney general’s case against him. That answer was stricken.\n\nJudge Engoron then recommended: “Mr. Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally…Maybe you should have a talk with him right now.”\n\nEventually, Kise threw up his hands and replied: “You’re in control of the courtroom, not me.”\n\nWhile giving another opinion about his own business acumen, Trump ran over questioning by Wallace and continued to boast about his property management techniques at one Fifth Avenue location in particular. That didn’t sit well with Engoron. The judge attempted to interject by saying “excuse me.” Trump then told the judge to “hold on” and continued discussing his capitalistic savvy.\n\nFinally, the judge had enough.\n\nAddressing Kise, Engoron instructed the defense attorney to “control your witness” and threatened to dismiss Trump from the stand and, instead, “draw every negative inference” from his absence.\n\n“I beseech you to control him,” the judge added.\n\nKise urged the court against such a course of action.\n\n“I’d urge the court to take in all information possible,” Trump’s attorney reportedly replied. “You have on the stand a candidate for president of the United States; the most efficient way to get through this is to listen to what he has to say…about what happened and why there’s no intent to mislead anyone. I believe that’s highly relevant and highly probative.”\n\nAnother Trump attorney, Alina Habba, then spoke up, somewhat more aggressively defending her client, advising the judge that if the state wants better responses from the witness, they shouldn’t ask open-ended questions.\n\n“We are not here to hear what he has to say,” Engoron explained. “We are here to listen to him answer questions.”\n\nHabba took direct issue with that, telling the judge: “Yes, you are here to listen to what he has to say.”\n\nIn response, the judge shouted at Habba and told her to sit down – before telling the state to proceed with questioning the witness.\n\n4. Trump complained about the judge’s work – and then posted about it\n\n“This is a very unfair trial,” the witness said after his lawyer was shouted down by the court. “Very, very unfair, and I hope the public is watching it.”\n\nAnd, during a recess, Trump made sure to highlight the blowup between Habba and Engoron.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, a conservative social media outlet owned by the former president, Trump posted a meme containing an image of the judge and his remark about not wanting to hear what Trump “has to say.”\n\nTrump, of course, has also been a voluble critic of James and her office. During his testimony, he opined that the attorney general was essentially targeting him in order to make a name for herself. In the process of this criticism, he suggested she had little personal knowledge of the ins and outs of New York real estate by questioning her basic grasp of geography.\n\n“She doesn’t know what 40 Wall Street is worth,” Trump said. “She doesn’t even know where 40 Wall Street is.”\n\nDuring the lunch recess, James made her own social media post in response to the courtroom antics in lower Manhattan on Monday.\n\n5. Trump wags his finger and highlights his wealth\n\nA constant theme throughout the testimony provided by the ex-president and current presidential candidate on Monday was the idea that he was being targeted for political reasons.\n\nIn support of this argument, Trump repeatedly stressed the end results of what happened between banks and the Trump Organization: everybody made money.\n\nBanks who lent Trump’s business money “got all their money back” and loans were always “paid off in full,” he testified.\n\n“There was no loss of money,” the witness reportedly said during questioning after the lunchtime recess. “They made a lot of money, and everyone is trying to figure out why you’re doing it…I understand it. It’s called ‘politics.'”\n\nLaunching into another speech-in-miniature, Trump called Wallace and the state’s case against him “a disgrace” and continued to muse about the political origins of the attorney general’s complaint.\n\n“It’s election interference because you want to keep me in this courthouse all day long,” he reportedly complained.\n\nProsecutors argue that the fraudulent documents were material, however, because the figures included in them often resulted in Trump receiving favorable interest rates on the loans.\n\n“Everybody got their money in full, and now you’re assuming the statements are phony,” Trump said earlier on.\n\nIf anything, Trump testified, the statements of financial condition likely underestimated “how rich” the Trump Organization really was when they were filed\n\n“I became president because of my brand,” Trump reportedly said. “If I wanted to build up a statement because of my brand, all I would have to do is add brand value and my financial statement would be very very substantial.”\n\nLater on, Wallace repeatedly pressed the witness on various loan agreements that required him to provide “true and correct” financial statements – focusing on language that necessitated certain high-threshold cash reserves.\n\n“The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements,” Trump reportedly said in response. “So I don’t know what you’re getting at.”\n\nAsked point blank, however, whether the financial statements inflated his assets, the witness returned to a favored defense. Trump argued that so-called “worthless clause” disclaimers – clauses that advise caution in interpreting financial data – render any financial misstatements less significant than the state is making them out to be.\n\nSuch disclaimers, the witness said, “go on forever.”\n\nPerhaps feeling left out from all of the prior drama, the state’s attorney then got in a rare zinger of his own.\n\n“That clause isn’t the only thing that goes on forever,” Wallace reportedly deadpanned.""}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/highlights-trumps-hours-witness-stand-223846363.html', 'Headline': ""Highlights of Donald Trump's hours on the witness stand at his New York ..."", 'Snippet': ""Here are some highlights from Trump's day on the witness stand: 'A VERY UNFAIR TRIAL' Trump made his grievances a focal point of his testimony, amplifying complaints the 2024 Republican front ..."", 'Full_text': 'NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump went off. Again and again. Making the witness stand at his civil fraud trial his podium, the former president laid into the judge who\'ll decide the case and the New York attorney general who’s suing him.\n\nDuring 3½ hours of testimony on Monday, the Republican denied Attorney General Letitia James’ allegations that he duped banks by exaggerating his wealth on financial statements used to make deals and secure loans.\n\n“There was no victim. There was no anything,"" he said.\n\nHe bragged about his riches, saying he has “a lot of cash"" and described one of the grown sons he put in charge of his company as a “hard working boy."" He said of his priorities while president: ""My threshold was China, Russia and keeping our country safe.""\n\nTrump’s often verbose responses — replete with anecdotes about development projects, the intricacies of property valuations and complaints that he was a victim of a “political witch hunt” — led a frustrated Judge Arthur Engoron to warn: “This is not a political rally.”\n\nHere are some highlights from Trump\'s day on the witness stand:\n\n\'A VERY UNFAIR TRIAL\'\n\nTrump made his grievances a focal point of his testimony, amplifying complaints the 2024 Republican front-runner has made for weeks in front of TV cameras outside the courtroom.\n\nHe directed a lot of his ire against the judge, who issued a decision before the trial even began holding Trump liable for fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me without knowing anything about me,” Trump testified. “He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me. I think it’s fraudulent, the decision. I think it’s fraudulent. The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nDuring the trial, the judge has fined Trump $15,000 for violating a limited gag order barring attacks on court staff. But nothing in the order bars the former president from criticizing the judge.\n\nEngoron did try to clamp down on Trump\'s speechifying during his testimony.\n\n“I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron told one of Trump\'s lawyers. The former president retorted: “This is a very unfair trial, very, very. And I hope the public is watching it.”\n\nEngoron\'s admonition only gave Trump more ammunition to claim he was being mistreated. Trump later posted Engoron’s “not here to hear what he has to say” comment to his Truth Social account.\n\nOn the witness stand, Trump suggested the judge should\'ve showed him deference as a former president, testifying, “How do you rule against somebody and call them a fraud, as the president of the United States, who did a great job?”\n\nSTATEMENTS \'WEREN\'T VERY BADLY NEEDED\'\n\nIn defending his business practices, Trump sought to downplay the importance of the annual statements of financial condition at issue in the case. He testified that the documents, which listed values for his properties and assets, were “nice to see” but “weren\'t very badly needed” to obtain financing and make deals.\n\nEven when banks required Trump to provide copies of his financial statements as part of a loan agreement, he testified that they really wanted to know if he had enough cash to cover the loan. Trump testified that he typically kept $300 million to $400 million in the bank, saying, “I’ve had a lot of cash for a long time.""\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to,” Trump testified. “They looked at the deal. They looked at the asset. If it is real estate, they looked at the location.”\n\nRetired Deutsche Bank official Nicholas Haigh testified earlier in the trial that the bank, which loaned Trump hundreds of millions of dollars, would look to his financial statements to ensure that his “financial strength is being maintained.”\n\nTrump testified that he relied on two longtime Trump Organization executives and an outside accounting firm to prepare his financial statements. He said ex-CFO Allen Weisselberg would give him a draft before each year\'s statement was finalized and that he\'d “look it over and maybe have a suggestion.”\n\n""But it wasn’t very important,"" Trump testified. ""You’ve made it important. But it wasn’t very important to me.”\n\nA ‘VERY, VERY POWERFUL’ DISCLAIMER\n\nTrump testified that he had no qualms with how his financial statements turned out and that, if anything, they undervalued some of his properties. Regardless, he said, the statements had a “disclaimer clause that was very, very powerful"" that absolved him and his company of responsibility.\n\nTrump said the disclaimer instructed banks and others: “Do your own due diligence. Do your own work. Do your own study. Don’t take anything from this statement for granted.""\n\nThe disclaimer said, among other things, that the financial statements weren’t audited by outside accountants.\n\nTrump mentioned the disclaimer more than a dozen times, at one point irking Engoron, whose pretrial ruling found that the clause didn\'t insulate Trump from liability.\n\n“No, no, no. We are not going to hear about the disclaimer clause,” the judge bellowed. “If you want to know about the disclaimer clause, read my opinion again, or for the first time, perhaps.”\n\n“Well, you are wrong on the opinion,” Trump responded.\n\n‘A VERY SAD THING’ FOR EX-CFO\n\nAs Trump wrapped up his testimony, he expressed sorrow for Weisselberg, his longtime finance chief who pleaded guilty and served jail time last year for evading taxes on pricey company-paid perks, including a Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren.\n\nAt a trial largely built on Weisselberg\'s testimony, Trump\'s company was convicted last year of helping executives dodge taxes on such perks. The Trump Organization was ordered to pay a $1.6 million fine.\n\n“It was a sad, very sad thing,"" Trump testified. “People went after him viciously and violently because he happened to work for me.”\n\nTrump testified that he’d learned of Weisselberg’s tax misdeeds only through last year’s trial, where the ex-executive testified that his schemes were unknown to his boss. Despite the revelation about his trusted lieutenant, Trump said he never thought to go back and review Weisselberg\'s work.\n\n“The education of his grandchildren -- that is going to be some kind of a breach where you want to put a man in jail? It’s a very sad thing,” Trump lamented.\n\n‘A DISGRACE’ AND ‘DISTRACTIONS’\n\nTrump looked away from Attorney General James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he tore into the Democrat, accusing her of pursuing him to advance her political career.\n\n“She’s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,” Trump testified, adding that James “should be ashamed of herself.”\n\nTrump also directed his enmity at Kevin Wallace, the lawyer from James’ office who was questioning him, saying: “People like you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me. Probably for political reasons. In her case, definitely for political reasons.”\n\nJames made a short-lived run for New York governor in 2021 before winning reelection as attorney general last year.\n\nOutside court Monday, James said Trump was “engaging in distractions and engaging in name calling” to steal attention from the evidence against him.\n\nAT MAR-A-LAGO, ‘FOREVER’ ISN\'T NECESSARILY FOREVER\n\nTrump suggested he or his heirs could someday depart from a decades-old agreement that limits the use of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump’s financial statements have valued the sprawling Palm Beach club as high as $739 million, based on what James’ office argues is a false premise that it could be sold as a private residence. Real estate agents say it\'s possible it could fetch $1 billion as a home. Trump claims the property is now worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2002, Trump signed an agreement with the National Trust for Historic Preservation that limited Mar-a-Lago’s use to a social club. From the stand, Trump argued that language in the document stating that he did “intend to forever” use the estate as a club didn’t necessarily mean forever.\n\n“It doesn’t say I will. It says ‘intend,’” Trump testified, adding: “I would, personally, never change it. If somebody later on, including my children, if they want to change it, I believe they would have a right to do that.”\n\nShown a 2003 article in The Palm Beach Post that quoted him saying “it will forever be a club,” Trump responded, “I think that was said with bravado, as opposed to with legal intent.”\n\nTrump acknowledged benefiting from the deal, testifying that as a club “you pay much less tax.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.fox5ny.com/news/donald-trump-witness-stand-testifies-fraud-trial', 'Headline': 'Trump lashes out from the witness stand at judge, NY ... - FOX 5 New York', 'Snippet': 'A defiant Donald Trump has sparred with a New York judge and slammed the state attorney general suing him, using the witness stand at his civil fraud trial to defend his riches and lash out at a ...', 'Full_text': 'A defiant Donald Trump sparred with a New York judge and slammed the state attorney general suing him Monday, using the witness stand at his civil fraud trial to defend his riches and lash out at a case that imperils his real estate empire.\n\nThe former president’s barbed testimony spurred the judge to admonish, ""This is not a political rally.""\n\nTrump\'s long-awaited testimony about property valuations and financial statements was punctuated by personal jabs at state Judge Arthur Engoron, who he said was biased against him, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he derided as a ""political hack."" He proudly boasted of his real estate business — ""I\'m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements"" — and disputed claims that he had deceived banks and insurers.\n\nFeatured\n\n""This is the opposite of fraud,"" he declared. Referring to James, a Democrat whose office brought the lawsuit, he said, ""The fraud is her.""\n\nThe testy exchanges and frequent rebukes from the judge underscored Trump’s unwillingness to adapt his famously freewheeling rhetorical style to a formal courtroom setting governed by rules of evidence and legal protocol. His presence on the stand was a vivid reminder of the legal troubles he faces as he vies to reclaim the White House in 2024.\n\nIt also functioned as a campaign platform for the former president and leading Republican presidential candidate to raise anew to supporters his claims of political persecution at the hands of government lawyers and judges.\n\nFeatured\n\n""People are sick and tired of what’s happening. I think it is a very sad day for America,"" Trump told reporters outside the courtroom after roughly three-and-a-half hours on the stand.\n\nThe fraud case doesn’t carry the prospect of prison as Trump\'s upcoming criminal cases do. But its allegations of financial impropriety cut to the very heart of the brand he spent decades crafting. Engoron has already ruled that Trump committed fraud by inflating his financial statements, putting the the ex-president’s future control of Trump Tower and his other marquee properties into question.\n\nThe non-jury trial addresses other claims in the lawsuit brought by James against Trump, his company and top executives, including his eldest sons. She wants the defendants to fork over what she claims is more than $300 million in ill-gotten gains and to be banned from doing business in New York.\n\nFeatured\n\nThe civil trial is one of numerous legal proceedings facing Trump as he runs for a second term, including federal and state charges accusing him of crimes including illegally hoarding classified documents and scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election. His legal and political strategies have now become completely intertwined as he hopscotches between campaign events and court hearings, a schedule that will only intensify once his criminal trials begin.\n\nTrump has been particularly engaged in his fraud trial, aggrieved by the suggestion that he’s worth less than he’s claimed.\n\n""I’m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements,"" he said Monday on the stand, telling a state lawyer, ""You go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me, probably for political reasons.""\n\nFeatured\n\nHis testimony got off to a contentious start, with the judge turning to Trump’s attorney at one point and saying: ""I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t, I will.""\n\nThe courtroom at 60 Centre Street had already become a familiar destination for Trump, who spent days over the past month voluntarily seated at the defense table, observing the proceedings. He took the stand once before — unexpectedly and briefly — after he was accused of violating a partial gag order. He denied violating the rules, but Engoron disagreed and fined him anyway.\n\nHis turn as a witness gave him the biggest opportunity yet to respond to allegations against him.\n\nSummoned by lawyers for the state, Trump repeatedly bristled at the suggestion that he had ever intended to defraud financial institutions. He said he had been misquoted or taken too literally in past public comments about his business dealings and his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said disclaimers in his financial statements covered any missteps. He returned to a familiar position that no one had been victimized, though state lawyers contend that Trump was able to get lower interest rates and other benefits because of the wealth reflected on his financial statements.\n\n""Not one bank lost money. Not one insurance company lost money,"" he declared.\n\nTensions between Engoron and Trump — already on display in recent weeks, when the judge fined him a total of $15,000 for incendiary outside-of-court comments — were evident early on Monday when the ex-president was repeatedly scolded about the length and content of his answers.\n\nEngoron, who determined in a ruling earlier that Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, will decide the non-jury case. He cautioned at one point that he was prepared to draw ""negative inferences"" against the former president if he failed to rein in his answers.\n\n""I do not want to hear everything this witness has to say. He has a lot to say that has nothing to do with the case or the questions,"" the judge said.\n\nDespite the testy back-and-forth early in the day, Trump was later able to veer into expansive answers without anyone cutting him off, using the opportunity to rail against James, the judge and the proceedings in general.\n\n""I think that she’s a political hack, and I think she used this case to try and become governor, and she used it successfully to become attorney general. I think it’s a disgrace that this case is going on,"" Trump said.\n\nOf Engoron, Trump said, ""He ruled against me, and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me.""\n\nJames, who was in the courtroom, stared straight ahead at Trump as he spoke and was seen chuckling when Trump suggested she didn\'t know anything about one of his properties, which is located across the street from her office. Afterward, she told reporters: ""He rambled. He hurled insults. But we expected that.""\n\nMonday’s testimony centered on the core of the allegations by the state attorney general: that Trump and his company intentionally inflated property values and deceived banks and insurers in the pursuit of business deals and loans.\n\nEchoing the stance taken by two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, in their own testimony last week, Trump sought to downplay his direct involvement in preparing and assessing financial statements that the attorney general claims were grossly inflated and fraudulent.\n\n""All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements,"" he said. As for the results, ""I would look at them, I would see them and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.""\n\nHe also played down the significance of the statements, which went to banks and others to secure financing and deals.\n\n""Banks didn’t find them very relevant, and they had a disclaimer clause -- you would call it a worthless statement clause,"" he said, insisting that after decades in real estate, ""I probably know banks as well as anybody. … I know what they look at. They look at the deal, they look at the location.""\n\nHe complained that his 2014 financial statements shouldn’t be a subject of the lawsuit at all.\n\n""First of all it’s so long ago, it’s well beyond the statute of limitations,"" Trump said before turning on Engoron, saying he allowed state lawyers to pursue claims involving such years-old documents ""because he always rules against me.""\n\nEngoron said, ""You can attack me in whichever way you want, but please answer the questions.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1c247874-bca4-408d-a539-93f5f113ce0b', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump delivers heated testimony in New York civil fraud trial', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump played down the importance of the financial statements at the centre of a civil fraud lawsuit as he took a tumultuous turn on the witness stand that provoked several rebukes from the ...', 'Full_text': 'The new FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

Unlike Trump’s rally, Biden’s was a drive-in rally that enforced social distancing. NBC News reported that Biden’s rally was attended by close to 300 cars.\n\nWhen Biden spoke in Tampa on Thursday evening, he said that Trump had just hosted “a superspreader event here again. He’s spreading more than just the virus, he’s spreading division,” he said.\n\nBiden also advocated for wearing masks. “This isn’t a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty,” he said. “But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science.”\n\nWhile Trump’s rally earlier in the day used water hoses to help cool down supporters, Biden’s rally was interrupted by a heavy downpour of rain, which led to the rally ending early, NBC News reported. Biden told the crowd that he was shortening his speech. “Get out of the rain!” he advised.\n\nBiden spoke about topics like healthcare, the pandemic, and taxes. Supporters honked in their cars to show support.\n\nBiden’s rally enforced social distancing, shared Angie Angers of Bay News 9.

The rally took place in the parking lot at Turner Field, AJC reported.\n\nDespite the rally being a socially distanced, drive-in rally, some photos revealed that while attendees wore masks, not all were actually social distancing. Deadline referred to the crowd as “somewhat socially distanced” and noted that about 500 cars were parked in attendance at the rally.\n\nBiden advocated for the Democrat candidates in the runoff, in part because of the stimulus checks. He told the group: “If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people,” he said.\n\nHe also noted: “And if you send (Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler) back to Washington, those checks will never get there…”\n\nDuring his speech, Biden told attendees: “The power is literally in your hands, unlike any time in my career. One state, one state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation.”\n\nHe also stated: “The debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives. Your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans… If you’re like millions of Americans all across this country, you need the money, you need the help, and you need it now.”\n\nBiden criticized Trump’s approach to the vaccine rollout and the pandemic, saying: “This administration has gotten off to a God-awful start.

The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/elections/presidential/2023/08/03/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-crowd-size-says-about-enthusiasm-gop-candidate-president-2024-election/70499355007/', 'Headline': ""What Trump's Erie rally crowd size says about enthusiasm for candidate"", 'Snippet': 'Former President Donald Trump spoke in Erie for the fourth time Saturday as he seeks a third run for office.

A photo of the empty seats accompanied the story.\n\nSo which is it? A ""massive, arena crowd record"" or a ""humiliating"" turnout in an arena where a ""ton"" of seats were left empty?\n\nThe answer is probably neither.\n\nHere\'s what we know, what we don\'t and other important details that provide context:\n\nErie Events Executive Director Gus Pine said the Trump campaign had control over event registration and entry security and therefore it was ""difficult"" for Erie Events, which manages the venue, ""to verify an exact count."" Pine, however, agreed with two Erie Insurance Arena ushers who provided a rough estimate of the crowd size, putting it at 4,500.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond when asked if it had an attendance figure of its own.\n\nThe capacity of the arena\n\nThat 4,500 figure is about half of what the arena holds when its capacity is maximized. For concerts, where there can be reserved seating or general admission floor tickets, the venue can hold about 9,000 spectators. For Erie Otters hockey games, Erie Insurance Arena can hold more than 6,800 people.\n\nPine said the venue was arranged for what amounted to a concert for Trump\'s speech.\n\nAs the Erie Times-News observed, Trump left several sections of the arena vacant. Only a smattering of people sat in Sections 101, 201, 102, 202, 103, 203, 122, 222, 121, 221, 120, and 220 — some of them were entirely empty. Sections 204, 205, 206, 207, 219 and 218 were half-full at best.\n\nMost of the floor seats were occupied, as were the sections of seats behind and to the left and right of where the stage was situated.\n\nPrevious appearances\n\nThe caption on the Gateway Pundit photo is false. Perhaps Trump drew a record crowd when he last spoke at Erie Insurance Arena on Oct. 10, 2018, weeks before a critical midterm election. Then-Erie Bureau of Fire Chief Guy Santone estimated the 2018 rally attendance at about 9,000, a capacity crowd for the arena. Not only that, the Erie Times-News reported that as many as 3,000 additional supporters who couldn\'t get into the arena watched the speech from a large screen on the front lawn.\n\nWhen he spoke at the venue on Aug. 12, 2016, more than 8,000 people attended his rally, which was held just weeks after he accepted the GOP nomination in Cleveland.\n\nLast stop\n\nPrior to July 29, Trump\'s most recent stop in Erie was on the tarmac of Erie International Airport on Oct. 20, 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it may have been Trump\'s largest audience in Erie. Thousands turned out to hear Trump speak, with Air Force Once as his backdrop, just two weeks before the Nov. 3 general election.\n\nRecord crowds\n\nAnd even though the playlist ahead of Trump\'s rally at Erie Insurance Arena included songs like ""Candle in the Wind,"" ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Rocket Man,"" Trump\'s estimated crowd size Saturday doesn\'t come close to replicating what the performer of those songs, Elton John, drew when he played the arena in 2013 (7,955) or 2000 (7,274). Nor would it match the crowd Barry Manilow drew in 1988 (6,039) or the audience for Cher in 2004 (5,857).\n\nOther factors\n\nTrump\'s appearance in Erie Saturday came early in the GOP primary for president, when a lot of voters haven\'t tuned into the presidential campaign let alone chosen a candidate. And those who have followed the campaign might be pulling for someone else, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is a very distant second to Trump in most polls. It was Trump\'s first visit to Erie with political opposition from within his own party.\n\nOverall, the July 29 rally was Trump\'s fourth in Erie. Perhaps the intrigue of seeing him speak has worn off for some. Maybe it was a forecast that called for high temperatures but delivered fog and rain instead.\n\nNot yet committed\n\nProfessor Joe Morris, chairman of the Political Science Department at Mercyhurst University, suspects that despite Trump\'s ability to draw large crowds, the former president might have an enthusiasm issue with some Republicans and independents now that he\'s been indicted twice by federal grand juries for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House and his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which led to a four-count indictment Tuesday.\n\nTrump could soon be indicted by a grand jury in Georgia on election-related charges and he\'s already been charged in New York for an alleged hush-money scandal involving an adult film actress and others.\n\nVoters are split, he said, when it comes to a Trump-Biden rematch, according to most national polls. But in the Republican primary, some voters might not be ready for another four years of Trump.\n\n""Independents might feel, and even many Republicans might feel, that Donald Trump might not be the best choice, and they\'re not as firmly committed to his candidacy as they were, say, in 2016,"" Morris said.\n\nRecent polls, he said, suggest Trump, despite his sizable lead, might have an ""enthusiasm problem.""\n\n""There\'s a large percentage of even Republicans who are not enthusiastic about voting for Donald Trump, but they will do it if Joe Biden is the alternative,"" he said.\n\nBy comparison\n\nSo, did Trump draw a ""massive"" crowd to Erie on July 29?\n\nNot compared to past rallies, Morris said. But the businessman-turned-politician who\'s been twice impeached and now is under indictment in three criminal investigations retains his ""unique ability"" to draw large crowds.\n\nCould any other Republican or Democrat, including Biden, the sitting president, match Trump\'s Erie Insurance Arena turnout?\n\nNo, says Morris.\n\n""There\'s not another Republican or Democrat that can do what he can do,"" Morris said. ""And 4,500, if that is the number, that\'s still a good number, particularly with where we are in the election cycle. It\'s really impressive. But, again, the objective political scientist in me looking at polling data suggests that he does have an enthusiasm problem, at least by Donald Trump\'s standards.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/trump-commerce-georgia-rally-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': ""How Many Attended Trump's Georgia Rally?

It’s part of a series of “Save America” rallies that he’s hosting. Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened. Opinions on how large the crowd was varied from person to person attending.\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Georgia Rally, With Some Saying Attendance Was Smaller than Normal & Others Saying Attendance Was ‘Massive’\n\nThe rally took place at the Banks County Dragway (formerly known as the NHRA International Dragway) in Commerce, Georgia. Although doors opened in the afternoon, Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. Eastern, but he began about an hour late, Athens Banner-Herald reported.\n\nThe event was in part to support local Republican candidates or politicians, Athens Banner-Herald reported. Those on the speakers list included Herschel Walker and Sen. David Perdue who is running for governor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was also among the people scheduled to speak.\n\nOpinions about crowd size varied. Some in attendance said the crowd was “massive.” However, other reporters said the crowd was much smaller than Trump used to attract. Here’s a look at the various reports. It’s not known if local police will share an official estimate, but we will add it to this story if they do.\n\nStephen Fowler of GPB News (an NPR affiliate) attended the rally and estimated on Twitter that there were about 5,000 people in attendance. He wrote that it was “the smallest Trump rally I’ve ever covered here.” He said it was much smaller than the 20,000 to 30,000-size rallies that Trump had hosted in 2020.\n\nGreg Bluestein of Atlanta-Journal Constitution shared a photo during the rally indicating that the crowd behind the TV risers didn’t extend “as far as the eye could see,” as Trump had said it did.\n\nFowler also shared a photo of the crowd, which was large but didn’t extend quite as far back as past rally crowds have done.\n\nHowever, Joshua L. Jones of the Athens Banner-Herald tweeted that around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, there was a “massive crowd” at the rally, and shared a photo of a packed crowd.\n\nBurt Jones, a conservative running for Lieutenant Governor, described the crowd as “huge.”\n\nTrump quickly began his speech by calling the current Governor Brian Kemp a “RINO,” as he supported one of Kemp’s opponents. He commented that he was angry that he had supported Kemp in the past.\n\nFowler later shared a photo showing the crowd differences between 8:50, 8:20, and 7:20. He said the cold and windy weather was leading some to leave early, while Trump was still speaking.\n\nTrump also commented to attendees that he believed Georgia was “red as hell” and voting for Perdue would be “a vote for this country.”\n\nAt one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz said he would nominate Trump to be the Speaker of the House.\n\nThis happened while Trump was bringing some of the candidates he endorsed, along with others, to speak on the stage with him.\n\nTrump Has Two More Rallies Scheduled\n\nTrump has two more rallies scheduled over the next two weeks, according to his website. A rally in Washington, Michigan, is taking place on April 2 at 7 p.m. Eastern at the Michigan Star Sports Center. And a rally in Selma, North Carolina, is taking place on April 9 at 7 p.m. Eastern at The Farm at 95.\n\nTrump’s first rally of 2022 was in Florence, Arizona in mid-January. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021. He also held a rally in Conroe, Texas, in January that was attended by tens of thousands, according to media at the event.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election. However, he did tell the crowd during his speech in South Carolina that “we may have to run again,” and added “we will take back the White House.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.timesleader.com/news/1572934/trump-rally-drew-big-gop-names-supporters-who-drove-long-distances', 'Headline': 'Trump rally drew big GOP names, supporters who drove long distances', 'Snippet': 'Big names in attendance.

Here are some highlights from those interviews, as well as from speakers who took the stage before Trump came on.\n\n• Mike and Lisa Ditty of Effort: “We’re excited. (We can) Hopefully show our support and convince him to run again in 2024,” said Mike, an Army veteran.\n\nFor endorsement of gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano and Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, he said: “Mastriano, we’re on board. I really like his stance. Oz, we’re learning about”\n\nSide note: Lisa was celebrating her birthday at the rally.\n\n• Myron Jacien of West Wyoming: “Support,” he said was his reason for coming. “We have candidates that are going to get back and take over the economy. Economy’s hurting a lot of people and that’s why I’m here.”\n\nWhen asked if he thinks Trump will announce for 2024, Jacien said, “No,” then point to the trump flag hanging from his hatchback and said, “But I thought he already declared.”\n\n“I hope we go back red to save this economy. If the economy fails, the nation is gone,” Jacien said in conclusion.\n\n• Mark and Melissa Marzullo of Cicero, N.Y.: “I’d like to hear a response to what happened this past week,” Melissa said, reflecting on President Biden’s Thursday speech at Independence Hall.\n\nMark added that he’d like to hear a, “positive message and uplifting pride for our country.”\n\nHe also noted it would be “stellar” if Trump declared for 2024 tonight.\n\nIt also was Melissa’s birthday, and she thought the two -and-a-half hour drive to Wilkes-Barre to see Trump was the perfect present.\n\nIn closing, Mark said, “We just love America and all the people in this great nation. We just want to turn the direction of the country and Make America Great Again.”\n\nBig names in attendance\n\nSaturday’s rally was intended as a show of support by Trump for Mastriano, Oz and Jim Bognet in their races for governor, U.S. Senate and the 8th Congressional District respectively.\n\nMany eyes were focused on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who was giving media interviews outside and inside the arena prior to the event.\n\n“The people here are just like the people I represent in Georgia in my district,” Greene told the Times Leader. “I used to be one of these people, waiting in line … I love getting out and talking with them because I’m truly one of them.”\n\nGreene, 48, called Trump the “greatest president of my lifetime” and said that she expects to hear tonight from him that “come November, it’s freedom versus tyranny.”\n\nThe event formally got underway at about 4 p.m. with the National Anthem. Here are some highlights:\n\n• Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity was the first speaker.\n\n“We have a great lineup of people here ready to fight for our commonwealth and our country,” Garrity told the crowd. She said that “this election is the most important of our lifetime” and that “we could change things, we can and we must.”\n\n• Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene took the stage to a loud ovation.\n\n“I love you all … Joe Biden has declared all of you extremists,” she told the audience.\n\nGreene also repeated the baseless claim that Trump won the 2020 election.\n\n“We are going to fire Nancy Pelosi … I never liked her anyway, and her husband clearly has an alcohol problem,” she added.\n\nIn reference to the FBI taking documents from Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago: “That never should have happened, it was unconstitutional,” said Greene, who said to the crowd what she told Carroll earlier: “This November, it’s freedom versus tyranny.”\n\n“We’re not the extremists, we’re Americans,” she concluded.\n\n• Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, said “We have fallen way off course from the strong America we had under President Trump.”\n\nHe called the stream of “illegals and illegal drugs” coming across the border an “unmitigated disaster.”\n\nMeuser said “the world needs a strong America, now more than ever,” and called the upcoming election “a chance to put America on the right course.”\n\n• Congressional candidate Jim Bognet, of Hazleton, is running against Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Moosic, in the upcoming election.\n\n“In the 20 months since Joe Biden’s been president, he’s put America in the ditch,” said Bognet, who then took aim at President Joe Biden’s Thursday night speech in Philadelphia, in which the president spoke about the dangers of the MAGA movement to American democracy.\n\n“He demeaned us, he belittled us,” Bognet said, referring to the speech as “Biden B.S.”\n\nBognet wrapped up by saying that “Biden and Cartwright have lost their minds and sold their souls,” and then directed audience members to donate to his campaign.\n\n• U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz touted his endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, and slams Biden: “I think the only thing Joe Biden has built back better, is the Republican party.”\n\nHe also said: “You know what happens when you mix politics and medicine? Politics,” in reference to the government’s handling of COVID-19.\n\n• State Sen. Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominee for governor, ripped into Democratic nominee and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro as being “not a man of the people but a man of his own party politics.”\n\nThings Mastriano said he will accomplish “on day one” as governor:\n\n– Open up the state for drilling\n\n– No critical race theory in schools\n\n– “No boys on girls teams, or in girls bathrooms”\n\n– No accepting of illegal immigrants\n\n“It’s going to be a new day in PA,” he said.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/trump-rally-bubble-crowd-size/621292/', 'Headline': 'Why Trump Won’t Stop Talking About His Crowd Sizes - The Atlantic', 'Snippet': 'Before the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally ...', 'Full_text': 'You never know exactly what you’re going to get at a Trump rally—a creative variation on the “Lock her up” chant? A brand-new conspiracy theory? But you can always rely on the former president to brag about the size of the crowd. He will remark happily upon the gridlocked traffic getting into the event. He will exclaim that he cannot even pinpoint exactly where the crowd ends. And periodically, he will demand that videographers pivot their cameras around to capture the full extent of his devoted following.\n\nFor Donald Trump and his supporters, crowd size is more than just a bragging point. It’s proof that they are part of the American majority. “A person that comes here and has crowds that go further than the eye can see … and has cars that stretch out for 25 miles, that’s not somebody that lost an election,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Trump and his fans would often ask reporters how Joe Biden could possibly win when he didn’t have rallies as big as Trump’s. Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost. Look at all of these people! In Arizona this weekend, 51-year-old Tammy Shutts put it this way to me: “100 percent, 1,000 percent, 1 million percent Biden didn’t win” her state, she said, gesturing to the hordes of people around her. “I’ve been in Arizona for almost 21 years. There is no way—no way—we went blue.”\n\nMany American liberals live in political bubbles. Some people in overwhelmingly blue parts of the country, for example, were shocked to find that Trump got so many votes in 2016. (“I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for [Richard] Nixon,” the film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the former president, acknowledging her own political bubble just weeks after Nixon smashed George McGovern in 1972.) Some of those same blue-area Democrats were just as confident that Senator Elizabeth Warren would be the party nominee. But Republicans also live in bubbles.\n\nHuman beings aren’t particularly comfortable hearing information that challenges our closely held beliefs, and the urge to reject evidence that goes against our political opinions is especially strong. Reading only certain websites or watching particular TV channels shields Americans from facts and opinions they don’t like, and geographic sorting protects partisans from unpleasant interactions with people who hold different beliefs. Political segregation in America has increased dramatically in the past decade. “For about one in five Republicans, and two in five Democrats, less than a quarter of their neighbors belong to the opposite political party,” according to a recent study published in Nature. In other words, Trump voters might find it hard to believe that Biden won the election because their neighbors and friends mostly voted for Trump too.\n\nTrump’s rallies amplify these phenomena, Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the Nature study, told me. “You have the president saying things, your neighbors who you [perceive as] saying the same things, and then these Trump rallies seem to be almost a social event,” he said. “Now you have an element of your social life, not just what you’re seeing on TV, that is caught up in believing these lies.” When you’re literally surrounded by believers, it’s hard to remember that doubters exist. Inside Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, for example, it can seem like the whole world is made up of Hawkeyes fans. Fortunately, that’s not true.

Spurred on by then-President Trump, rioters had traveled from far and wide to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHundreds involved in the siege have been arrested, but many remain at large as officials piece together what happened on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere are some notable facts about the insurrection and its fallout:\n\nMinutes Trump spoke before the siege: About 70\n\nThe day began with a rally to bolster Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential race was stolen from him. Before Congress certified election results, thousands of Trump supporters gathered on the National Mall, just south of the White House, and listened for hours as some of Trump’s most prominent defenders, including his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, promoted the falsehood.\n\nTrump addressed the crowd for one hour and 11 minutes and said he would “never concede” the race, and that if his supporters didn’t “fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nRally attendance: Thousands\n\nRally organizers told the National Park Service that they anticipated 30,000 people would attend. Law enforcement said the crowd size ahead of the protest was possibly as much as 80,000, according to then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. The crowd size at the rally was at least 10,000, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPeople surrounding the Capitol before the breach: Several thousand\n\nA lot of attendees are believed to have peeled off as the siege turned violent. Experts say it\'s challenging to accurately estimate the crowd size because of the absence of aerial imagery, but they put a broad crowd size estimate at ""several thousand.""\n\nCapitol Police officers on duty: More than 1,200\n\nMore than 1,200 Capitol Police officers were working on U.S. Capitol grounds at the time of the attack. The Capitol Police has not said exactly how many officers were guarding the Capitol building itself.\n\nThe time it took for reinforcements to arrive: 15 minutes (but it\'s complicated)\n\nThe Capitol complex was breached on Jan. 6 about 1:50 p.m. Though some District of Columbia police officers responded within 15 minutes, the Pentagon took more than three hours to send National Guard troops to aide Capitol Police, according to Maj. Gen. William J. Walker. But a watchdog report is critical of this timeline.\n\nDeaths from the insurrection: 5 (or more)\n\nMost news sources have officially counted five deaths including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after suffering two strokes, and San Diego resident Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by Capitol Police while climbing a barricaded door inside the Capitol. But some in Congress — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — have suggested the number of deaths is closer to nine and should include officers who committed suicide in the days and months following the attack.\n\nOfficers injured: More than 140\n\nMore than 140 law enforcement officers were physically harmed during the insurrection, according to a special congressional committee investigating the attack. In a July hearing, a District of Columbia police officer recounted a chaotic and violent day where he was tased in the head several times by rioters and beaten unconscious.\n\nPeople arrested: More than 700\n\nMore than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the insurrection, but the investigation is ongoing. More than 30 of those arrests were in California. The FBI is still seeking the public’s help to identify rioters.\n\nHours the certification of electors was delayed: More than 13\n\nThe Capitol was breached about 1:50 p.m. The Senate called a recess about 2:11 p.m. The Capitol was declared secure at 8 p.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) brought the House back into session at 9 p.m., and Vice President Mike Pence officially declared Joe Biden president-elect at 3:42 a.m. the next day.\n\nCost of cleanup and repairs: $1.5 million to more than $30 million\n\nTotal damages have been estimated to cost anywhere from $1.5 million to more than $30 million and include repairs and security measures like fencing.\n\nRioters left behind feces, blood, bullet holes, graffiti and bear repellent. Curators have requested $25,000 to restore historic artwork, including the bust of a U.S. politician accused of inciting another violent attack in the Capitol in 1954 — an armed group of four demanding Puerto Rico’s independence.\n\nPeople subpoenaed by Congress: 50-plus\n\nCongress has issued 51 subpoenas and counting in its investigation into the siege. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon are among those subpoenaed. Members of far-right extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have also been drawn into the investigation for their roles in planning and orchestrating the riot.\n\nJan. 6-related lawsuits involving Trump: At least 5\n\nThe insurrection has spawned more than five lawsuits, all involving Trump. A group of House Democrats, some Capitol Police officers and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) filed separate lawsuits against Trump for his role in inciting the mob to overtake the Capitol.\n\nTrump has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his lawsuit to block the release of White House records relating to the attack.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes.

Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January.

Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/us/politics/jan-6-committee-key-findings.html', 'Headline': 'Key Findings From the Jan. 6 Committee’s Report, Annotated', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol outlined 17 specific findings on Monday in the executive summary of its final report.', 'Full_text': 'The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol outlined 17 specific findings on Monday in the executive summary of its final report. Here are the findings, with additional context.\n\n1. Beginning election night and continuing through Jan. 6 and thereafter, Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The latest release comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress.\n\nSo far, the released transcripts have provided illuminating insights into the final weeks of former President Donald Trump’s presidency, with accounts from inside the Trump White House, from federal and state officials who resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election results, and many others.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Thursday’s disclosures:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. explains why he texted Meadows on November 5 about plans to keep his father in office\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee that the reason he texted Meadows a detailed plan about how to ensure his father would get a second term two days after the 2020 presidential election was because he thought the ideas were “the most sophisticated” and “sounded plausible.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s testimony, revealed by the select committee on Thursday, provides new context to a text message CNN first reported on in April where he lays out various ideas for keeping Trump in power by subverting the Electoral College process.\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6, 2021.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said that he was not the original author of the text, a point his lawyer made to CNN back in April, and that he did not remember who the original author of the message was, he explained to investigators why out of all the messages he was being sent at the time, he felt this one was necessary to pass on to Meadows.\n\n“Perhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don’t necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nMeadows did not initially respond to the original November 5 text, but when Trump Jr. followed up the next day to make sure he saw, Trump’s then-chief of staff texted, “much of this had merit. Working on this for PA, so Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina already.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., fiancée don’t recall details and distance themselves from events that led to January 6, transcripts show\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee he couldn’t recall key details related to his appearance at a rally that preceded the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump Jr. said he didn’t know Turning Point Action paid him and his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle $30,000 each for their appearances at the rally on the White House ellipse. He said he thought the money was for an event at the Palm Beach Hilton in December, according to a transcript released Thursday.\n\n“My recollection was that we had spoken for them prior to Christmas at an event that we did annually and always got sort of paid for speaking fees to show up,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nIn transcripts of their interviews with the House select committee, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle repeatedly said they didn’t recall details and distanced themselves from the events that led to the January 6 attack. Trump Jr. told committee investigators, “I don’t recall specifically,” when asked if he ever received the $30,000 and “I don’t know,” when asked if Guilfoyle ever ended up getting paid.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle said they didn’t remember specific conversations about rally planning and that they were in the dark about the particulars as it was being put together.\n\nGuilfoyle also denied having conversations with anyone linking the rally to objections to Congress certifying Joe Biden’s electoral win.\n\n“I was not involved in any of that certification stuff. I couldn’t explain it to you to this day,” she said, adding that she didn’t know the significance of holding the rally on January 6.\n\n‘Just give me five dead voters’: Sen. Lindsey Graham said after 2020 election, Trump lawyer tells committee\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Sen. Lindsey Graham pledged to become a “champion” of then-President Trump’s election fraud claims – if only Trump’s advisers would give him information about dead voters, according to an account given to the January 6 committee.\n\n“Senator Graham was saying, ‘Get me your information,’” Trump lawyer Christina Bobb relayed to the committee about what Graham said in a meeting days before the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n“Just give me five dead voters,” Bobb said Graham told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others in Meadows’ office at the White House.\n\n“Give me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion,” Bobb added, relaying what Graham said at the time.\n\nThe exchange with Graham highlights how the South Carolina Republican became involved in Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn his election loss in Georgia, and how the White House at the time was connecting with influential politicians to advance Trump’s message of false election fraud claims.\n\n“Graham was like, ‘Oh, I’d love to support the cause. I think it would be great to, you know, really show all the fraud. Send me a memo and show me, you know, what information you have got. I’ll champion it,’” Bobb also recalled from the conversation with Graham.\n\nAccording to a transcript of Bobb’s House testimony released Thursday, Graham received a memo from the legal team working with Trump, titled “Chairman Graham dead votes memo for your consideration.”\n\nBut Bobb added: “He did nothing with it.”\n\nGraham’s office pointed out on Thursday that the book “Peril” by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa previously described a similar exchange between Graham and the Trump advisers. After receiving their memo, the senator was unconvinced of the fraud they claimed, the book said. His office didn’t provide any further response.\n\nGrisham says she learned Trump thought rioters ‘looked very trashy’ but loved that they were ‘fighting for him’\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, said she learned from people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, that Trump thought the rioters “looked very trashy,” but reveled in how they were “fighting for him.”\n\nGrisham told the committee: “I heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments – some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were.”\n\n“He was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn’t like how they looked,” Grisham said.\n\nMelania Trump didn’t trust her husband’s inner circle, the former first lady’s chief of staff says\n\nGrisham also detailed the former first lady’s distrust in people close to her husband after the 2020 election, including Donald Trump Jr.\n\n“Certainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of their – of Don Jr.’s father,” Grisham told the committee.\n\nGrisham said Melania also distrusted “people that she thought were giving her husband bad advice,” like lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and campaign staffers. “She would say, I think they’re giving him bad advice, I don’t think this is smart.”\n\nFormer Trump acting defense secretary endorsed giving DC mayor more control of DC National Guard\n\nChris Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told the committee he thought the Washington, DC, mayor should have greater control of the DC National Guard in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nMiller was asked in his January deposition about a proposal in Congress to give the Washington, DC, mayor the same authority to deploy the National Guard that a governor has. Because the District of Columbia is not a state, the authority to deploy is delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary and president.\n\nMiller said of the DC mayor being given more authority over the Guard: “Being a private citizen, I’ll tell you exactly what I think, and take it or leave. Heck, yeah.”\n\n“The mayor should absolutely have greater control over the DC National Guard,” he continued, according to a transcript released by the panel Thursday. “I do not know the history. And I’m sure there’s all sorts of reasons that are constitutional, way beyond what I understand, so I’m just kind of popping off, but there’s got to be a way to integrate her or the mayor into this process of work meaningfully and more proactively.”\n\nMiller testified to the committee about the lag in getting National Guard soldiers to the Capitol on January 6, saying that he didn’t know why Major Gen. William Walker, the DC National Guard Commander, believed he didn’t have approval to deploy. According to the January 6 committee’s report, Walker “understood he had to wait for approval from Secretary (Ryan) McCarthy to deploy his forces. But as he waited on that video call for hours, he did strongly consider sending them anyway.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/jan-6-final-report-findings/', 'Headline': 'Key findings from the Jan. 6 committee’s final report', 'Snippet': 'The committee’s July 21 hearing filled in a lot of the gaps of how Trump spent Jan. 6 (according to them, mostly watching television). You can explore a full timeline of Trump’s day here .', 'Full_text': '1. ‘Potus im sure is loving this’: Mid-riot text adds to suggestions of Trump’s approval\n\nThe committee has focused extensively on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction as the riot was taking place. But it has occasionally suggested that he might have approved of what was happening or at least seen some political upside in it.\n\nAnd the final report contains more grist for that mill: One of the most striking new revelations is a text message from a Trump aide, Robert Gabriel. At 2:49 p.m., as the Capitol was under siege, Gabriel texted, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\nThe text builds upon previously known evidence.\n\nShortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during the riot, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nWhite House aide Sarah Matthews has said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her that Trump resisted calling on the rioters to be “peaceful” in a tweet. (In texts from the time and in later testimony to the committee, Trump aide Hope Hicks also said that, before Jan. 6, both she and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann called for Trump to preemptively urge peacefulness, but that Trump “refused.”)\n\nWhite House aide Cassidy Hutchinson has also testified that, amid a frantic effort to get Trump to act, she overheard chief of staff Mark Meadows telling White House counsel Pat Cipollone, “He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat.”\n\nThe committee pressed Cipollone on whether Trump actually wanted people to leave the Capitol. Cipollone had said he couldn’t think of anyone on staff who didn’t want the rioters to leave. But when asked whether Trump shared in that opinion, Cipollone struggled with the question and ultimately punted, saying he couldn’t “reveal communications” with Trump, citing executive privilege.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. New details on the ‘fake elector’ plot\n\nOne of the committee’s criminal referrals hones in on the effort to appoint alternate Trump electors (also known as “fake electors”) in key states. And a key question has been: What was the intent behind their appointment?\n\nThe Trump campaign pitched these electors as just a contingency — i.e., they needed to be in place by the Dec. 14 deadline, just in case a given state changed course and declared Trump the winner of their electoral votes. But there has been evidence that some of the architects of the plot planned to deploy the electors regardless, in a much more desperate and forceful ploy to overturn legitimate election results.\n\nSome of the fake electors were apparently concerned about the strategy, or even saw something unsavory ahead. In newly revealed evidence, Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt texted his party’s executive director in late November and said, “I hope they are not planning on asking us to do anything like try and say we are only the proper electors.” He added on Dec. 12 after receiving a message about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: “These guys are up to no good and its gonna fail miserably.” Hitt signed on as a Trump elector anyway.\n\nOther electors clearly worried about legal liability, insisting (in New Mexico and Pennsylvania) that the documents listing them specify that they were only legitimate if their states’ election results were overturned. But most documents made no such distinction.\n\nThe committee also detailed new evidence linking Giuliani, Trump and Meadows to the early fake-elector effort. Trump campaign lawyer Joshua Findlay testified that “it was my understanding that the President made” the decision to have someone look into the feasibility of appointing alternative electors around Dec. 7 or 8.\n\n3. Some notable recommendations — including on 14th Amendment\n\nOn Monday, the committee took the historic step of referring Trump and others to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But the report features some other recommendations, including one that had been floated after Jan. 6: possibly disqualifying Trump and others from holding office.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution says that anyone who has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States can be barred from holding office. (This law has been invoked in unsuccessful efforts to bar some GOP lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from office.)\n\nTrump’s second impeachment featured a historic number of members of the president’s own party voting in favor. And some Democrats and watchdogs continue to argue for Trump to be barred from office. But with Republicans taking over the House in early January — and even Democrats generally having shown little appetite for this step before — it appears unlikely Congress will take up this proposal.\n\nThe report also advises that congressional committees look into media and social media companies whose policies have “have had the effect of radicalizing their consumers, including by provoking people to attack their own country.” And it recommends possible safeguards against a president misusing the Insurrection Act, which some Trump allies floated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It suggests Trump defamed Dominion\n\nSome have questioned why, though Fox News and others have found themselves under legal scrutiny, Trump himself isn’t the focus of high-profile lawsuits aimed at those who spread lies and misinformation about voting machines. (Legal experts disagree on the strength of the potential legal case a plaintiff would have against him.)\n\nThe report lays out how Trump was repeatedly told what he was saying about Dominion voting machines was false, even as he continued to spout the claims. And it suggests Trump meets the test for defaming Dominion.\n\n“President Trump’s own campaign staff, administration officials, and State officials, all told him the claims had no merit. Hand recounts confirmed the fidelity of the machines,"" the report says. ""But none of this overwhelming evidence mattered. President Trump demonstrated a conscious disregard for the facts and continued to maliciously smear Dominion.”\n\nThe language here is deliberate: Legally speaking, the “actual malice” standard for defamation requires proving that the person either knew what they were saying was false or showed a reckless disregard for whether it were true.\n\nThe report highlights previously known evidence about the various advisors and government officials who either tried to dissuade Trump from this theory, or knew that others had. It also added a new name this week: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who confirmed she had tried unsuccessfully to wave Trump off the theory.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, White House press aide Sarah Matthews also testified that McEnany “actively” resisted Trump’s attempts to get her to bring up the conspiracy theory in media interviews and hold White House briefings on the subject.\n\n5. The extent of Trump’s pressure campaign in key states\n\nWe’ve known that Trump and his allies pressured lawmakers and officials far and wide to help overturn the election results in key states. But the report lays out the vast scale of this effort.\n\nIt says, “President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.”\n\nWhat qualifies as “targeting” an official is, of course, subjective. But several officials indicate they felt the pressure.\n\nThen-Michigan state House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said he received between five and 10 phone calls from Trump after the election. Chatfield said he repeatedly informed Trump he had seen nothing that would overturn Trump’s nearly three-point deficit in the state, and he and state Senate President Mike Shirkey (R) put out a statement saying as much after a meeting with Trump.\n\nBut the Trump campaign on Jan. 3 tweeted that people should contact Chatfield or the GOP leader of the state Senate, Mike Shirkey, to “Demand [a] vote on decertification."" Trump’s social media team promoted Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey said he received 4,000 text messages. Chatfield testified, ""I and my family have received numerous threats, along with members on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe report details dozens of officials who were threatened, though not all were targeted by Trump personally. The chairman of the Maricopa County, Ariz., board of supervisors, Clint Hickman (R), said “the threats never abated.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Little focus on security issues, while mostly blaming Trump\n\nThe Washington Post reported in November that some committee members and staffers on the Jan. 6 committee were upset that Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wanted the report to focus so extensively on Trump. Well, the final product appears to reflect Cheney’s desires.\n\nThe report says relatively little about the security failures that had been the focus of some congressional probing. It mostly relegates those findings to the first appendix — about 30 pages long — near the end of the report. For example, it does little to reconcile conflicting timelines presented by key officials when it comes to when the National Guard was requested and approved.\n\nBut the verdict is rather damning, saying these failures also put lives in danger.\n\nThe report says that, before Jan. 6, both federal and local law enforcement had intelligence predicting violence that day. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.” the report says. “The failure to sufficiently share and act upon that intelligence jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\nIn the next breath, though, the report emphasizes Trump’s culpability and says that better planning might not have been able to account for the violence he would stoke.\n\n7. The full picture of an allegedly corrupt plot\n\nThe chief alleged crime the committee has focused on is what’s known as obstruction of an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’s counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. And showing that requires proving Trump acted corruptly.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth running through all the evidence — most of it previously established, but some new — that this plot was corrupt. The committee has keyed on a few things: that Trump was told his voter-fraud theories were false, that he actually knew he had lost the 2020 election, and that the participants in the plot knew it was illegal.\n\nIn addition to the previously-known figures who said they pushed back on Trump’s theories internally, the committee revealed this week that White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien testified about a Dec. 18 Oval Office phone call in which he said that there was no evidence of fraud using voting machines or foreign interference. Cipollone also testified that the lack of sufficient evidence was made clear internally “over and over again.”\n\nIncluding an official in Raffensperger’s office, the report details at least eight officials testifying that Trump and his team were informed his theories were false.\n\nAs for Trump admitting he lost: Hutchinson and another former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin have both said they heard about Trump doing so. And in a transcript released this week, Hutchinson said she asked Meadows, point blank, whether Trump knew he lost. According to Hutchinson, Meadows “said something to the effect of, ‘he knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There’s a chance he didn’t lose. I want to pull this off for him.”\n\nPrevious evidence also showed some of those involved admitted their plot was illegal or might not pass legal muster. That includes contemporaneous documents from Eastman, and testimony from Pence aide Greg Jacob and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann about their interactions with Eastman, and Giuliani, respectively, who they said admitted their case would lose in court. And in October, a judge ruled that Trump had knowingly signed a verification containing false voter-fraud figures that Eastman had admitted were wrong.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. What the report doesn’t shed light on\n\nThe scale of the investigation was massive, and many witnesses weren’t particularly forthcoming, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or, in some cases, not testifying at all. That means that some of the angles probed by the committee remain unresolved or disputed. Among them:\n\n- The committee didn’t resolve what happened in the presidential vehicle after Trump’s speech. Hutchinson had testified that White House aide Anthony M. Ornato told her that Trump became irate and lunged at the head of his Secret Service detail, Bobby Engel, when Engel wouldn’t bring him to the Capitol. (She emphasized that her account was secondhand.) Ornato said he didn’t recall conveying that information to Hutchinson, according to the committee. The committee confirmed with other witnesses that Trump was angry, but they did not confirm a physical altercation. In the end, the report says it was “difficult to fully reconcile the accounts of several of the witnesses who provided information with what we heard from Engel and Ornato.”\n\n- Some congressional Democrats suggested shortly after Jan. 6 that certain Republicans provided reconnaissance tours to rioters before Jan. 6. And more specifically, the committee raised questions about a tour Rep. Barry Loudermilk(R-Ga.) led on Jan. 5, which Loudermilk struggled to explain. But the report doesn’t dwell upon this at all. It merely mentions that one of Loudermilk’s guests who was captured on video at Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 “took pictures of hallways and staircases,” which was previously known.\n\n- Hutchinson testified that Trump was told people at his speech were found with weapons but was unconcerned — and even asked that security stop using magnetometers. This is a key piece of evidence, since Trump would later direct these people to the Capitol. Hutchinson said Trump justified his lack of concern by saying, “They’re not here to hurt me.” The report doesn’t confirm that Trump was told about the weapons, but it does say Engel recalled Trump making a similar comment, as Trump was trying to persuade Engel to take him to the Capitol.\n\ncorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated that it had been more than a century since the 14th Amendment was used to bar someone from public office. In September, a New Mexico judge used it to disqualify an Otero County commissioner.

While the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement ...', 'Full_text': 'The criminal referrals were a major escalation for a congressional investigation that is the most significant in a generation. The panel named five other Trump allies — Mark Meadows, his final chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro — as potential co-conspirators with Mr. Trump in actions the committee said warranted Justice Department investigation. The charges, including a fourth for Mr. Trump of conspiracy to make a false statement, would carry prison sentences, some of them lengthy, if federal prosecutors chose to pursue them.\n\nThe committee’s referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by the Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation into Jan. 6 and the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies leading up to the attack. But the referrals sent a powerful signal that a bipartisan committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the referrals.\n\nMr. Trump attacked the committee as “highly partisan” ahead of a final meeting the panel held on Monday to release an executive summary of its final report on the Capitol attack and to vote on referring the former president to the Justice Department.\n\n“It’s a kangaroo court,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “The Dan Bongino Show.” “The people aren’t going to stand for it.” He elaborated on that theme in a post on Truth Social, his social media network, after the meeting.\n\n“These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me,” he said, adding that he “told everyone to go home” on Jan. 6, but leaving out his hours of inaction before that while a mob of his supporters rampaged through the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans, who have vowed to investigate the committee after they take control of the House in January, mounted a modest response. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of the few to react with a statement, accusing the committee of staging a “partisan charade.” She promised that Republicans “will hold House Democrats accountable for their illegitimate abuse of power.”\n\nThe executive summary, a 154-page narrative of Mr. Trump’s relentless drive to remain in power after he lost the 2020 election by seven million votes, identifies co-conspirators who aided Mr. Trump. But it singles out the former president as the primary cause of the mob violence.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the summary stated. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary closely follows the evidence from the committee’s 10 previous public hearings, but the facts have been assembled into a readable narrative that amounts to an astonishing story of Mr. Trump’s efforts to effectively overthrow the government he led. The committee is expected to release a lengthy final report on Wednesday.\n\n“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and vice chairwoman of the committee, said at the start of the meeting.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said of Mr. Trump: “Nothing could be a greater betrayal of this duty than to assist in insurrection against the constitutional order.”\n\nThe summary and referrals have now set up a dynamic without parallel in the annals of American campaigns: Congress asking the Justice Department of an incumbent president to consider criminal charges against the president’s potential opponent in the next election. President Biden has indicated his intent to run in 2024, and Mr. Trump announced his re-election campaign last month.\n\nThe summary laid out step by step how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power, much as the committee did during its televised hearings in the summer. First, the summary said, Mr. Trump lied about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false. He then organized false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden as he pressured state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election. Finally, he amassed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe panel also referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee — including the man seeking to become the next speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California — because of their refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other Republicans referred were Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Jordan, Russell Dye, said in a statement that the referral was “just another partisan and political stunt.” A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Jay Ostrich, said the committee was engaged in “more games from a petulant and soon-to-be kangaroo court.’’\n\nMr. Biggs said in a tweet that the referral was the committee’s “final political stunt” and that he looked forward to “reviewing their documents, publishing their lies and setting the record straight” in the next Congress.\n\nIn its summary, the committee did not entirely resolve disputed accounts of what happened inside the presidential S.U.V. when Mr. Trump was told by his Secret Service agents that they could not take him to the Capitol to join the crowd on Jan. 6. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, testified under oath to the committee in public last summer that Anthony M. Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff, told her that Mr. Trump grew so angry that he lunged at his Secret Service agent and tried to grab the steering wheel. The Secret Service denied that account anonymously.\n\nThe summary said only that the “committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’” that occurred in the S.U.V. “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified to the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’”\n\nThe committee’s summary also concluded that there was no nefarious reason for why the National Guard was delayed for hours in responding to violence of Jan. 6.\n\n“Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard,” the committee wrote. “The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”\n\nIn its summary, the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate whether anyone had interfered with or obstructed the panel’s investigation, including whether any lawyers paid for by groups connected to Mr. Trump “may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the committee.”\n\nAmong the committee’s findings, revealed at its meeting on Monday, was that lawmakers became concerned that lawyers who were paid by Trump associates may have tried to interfere with the panel’s investigation. The panel also learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her “financially very comfortable” as the date of her testimony approached. But then offers were withdrawn or did not materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the committee said.\n\nThe committee also chastised certain witnesses that it said had not been forthright with investigators. It said it had “significant concerns about the credibility” of the testimony of Mr. Ornato.\n\nThe committee also said Kayleigh McEnany, one of Mr. Trump’s former press secretaries, and Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, had been less than forthcoming.\n\nThe summary demonstrated, as the committee’s hearings did, how despite being told repeatedly that his claims of election fraud were false, Mr. Trump kept up the lies.\n\nBill Stepien, a former White House political director, told the committee how he and others would investigate the claims, find them to be false, and report back to the president. “It’s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations,” Mr. Stepien said. “It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe summary also contained evidence that certain White House aides had grown concerned about the potential for violence on Jan. 6 and urged Mr. Trump to make a pre-emptive statement calling for peace. No such statement was made.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House communications director, said she suggested “several times” on Jan. 4 and 5 that Mr. Trump “publicly state that Jan. 6 must remain peaceful, and that he had refused her advice to do so,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel played new video from Ms. Hicks, who described a conversation with Mr. Trump.\n\n“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Ms. Hicks said she told the president.\n\nMr. Trump’s response? “Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,” she recalled him saying.\n\nWhile the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement failures, a topic not previously addressed at the panel’s hearings. “No analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6,” the committee wrote, although the “intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol.”\n\nOver the past year and a half, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than one million documents, issued more than 100 subpoenas and held hearings that drew millions of viewers.\n\nThe House created the Jan. 6 committee after Senate Republicans used a filibuster to defeat a proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the attack.\n\nThe committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — consistently broke new ground for a congressional investigation. Staffed with more than a dozen former federal prosecutors, the panel set a new production standard for how to hold a congressional hearing. It also got significantly ahead of a parallel Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, with federal prosecutors later interviewing many of the same witnesses Congress had spoken to.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal prosecutors under the supervision of a special counsel have issued subpoenas to officials in seven states in which the Trump campaign organized electors to falsely certify the election for Mr. Trump despite the voters choosing Mr. Biden.\n\nLawmakers on the panel also believe they played a significant role in elevating the issue of threats to democracy to voters, who rejected many election deniers in the November midterms.\n\nIn terms of legislative recommendations, the panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power. Lawmakers have also discussed changes to the Insurrection Act and legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. Those recommendations are expected to be detailed in the committee’s final report.\n\nKatie Benner and Anushka Patil contributed reporting.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The committee discovered that the lawyer John Eastman had advised Mr. Trump to undertake a campaign to push Mr. Pence into single-handedly deciding the election in his favor even though there was evidence that Mr. Eastman knew the plan was illegal. Some of Mr. Pence’s own aides told Mr. Trump the same, but he pressured Mr. Pence nonetheless.\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of acting attorney general to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.\n\nAnnotation: After leaders in the Justice Department — including Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy — told Mr. Trump that he was wrong about his claims concerning fraud in the election, Mr. Trump wanted to appoint Mr. Clark, a loyalist, to run the department. Mr. Clark had promised to send out letters to leaders in key swing states saying that prosecutors had in fact found fraud in the election. The president decided not to appoint Mr. Clark only after several senior department officials threatened to quit if he did.\n\n5. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.\n\nAnnotation: In the weeks that followed the election, Mr. Trump and his allies had calls and meetings with local officials in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona in which they pressured the officials to use their powers to assign electors from the states to him. More famously, Mr. Trump also asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to help him “find” the 11,000 votes he needed to win the election there.\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAnnotation: This refers to one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive schemes to maintain his grip on power: a plan to have state officials create and submit fake electors pledged to him in seven swing states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states.\n\nAnnotation: The committee found that Mr. Trump also played a role in a plan closely related to the fake-electors scheme: He helped to persuade 139 House Republicans to dispute the Electoral College count on the day the Capitol was attacked.\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in federal court.\n\nAnnotation: In December 2020, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in Fulton County, Ga., contending that thousands of votes had been improperly counted and citing specific numbers of dead people, felons and unregistered voters who had cast ballots. Mr. Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one of his own lawyers, Mr. Eastman, had determined it was false.\n\n9. Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to “take back” their country.\n\nAnnotation: The committee determined that a tweet posted by Mr. Trump on Dec. 19, 2020, announcing a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6 was heard as a clarion call by both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters who sprang into action preparing for the event. When they got to Washington for the rally, Mr. Trump’s speech calling on them to “fight like hell” was a central driver in sending them on toward the Capitol.\n\n10. Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The tweet the committee is referring to here said, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” Court papers show that some rioters at the Capitol responded directly to it by pushing toward and ultimately into the building.\n\n11. Knowing that violence was underway at the Capitol, and despite his duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple-hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television. This failure to act perpetuated the violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress’s proceeding to count electoral votes.\n\nAnnotation: The committee accused Mr. Trump of “a dereliction of duty” for letting nearly three hours pass between learning that the Capitol was under siege and calling for his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds. During that time, several people close to him — including his daughter Ivanka — begged Mr. Trump to issue a statement that would calm down the crowd.\n\n12. Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n13. The intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol. As Jan. 6 approached, the intelligence specifically identified the potential for violence at the Capitol. This intelligence was shared within the executive branch, including with the Secret Service and the president’s National Security Council.\n\n14. Intelligence gathered in advance of Jan. 6 did not support a conclusion that antifa or other left-wing groups would likely engage in a violent counterdemonstration, or attack Trump supporters on Jan. 6. Indeed, intelligence from Jan. 5 indicated that some left-wing groups were instructing their members to “stay at home” and not attend on Jan. 6. Ultimately, none of these groups was involved to any material extent with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n15. Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence in advance of Jan. 6 on the full extent of the ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot by sending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale of the violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcement anticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave the Capitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysis predicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation for 13, 14 and 15: The committee has faced criticism, especially from Republicans, for not focusing more attention on the failures by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack. But the panel did present some preliminary findings and may ultimately issue a separate report.\n\n16. Hundreds of Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers performed their duties bravely on Jan. 6, and America owes those individual immense gratitude for their courage in the defense of Congress and our constitution. Without their bravery, Jan. 6 would have been far worse. Although certain members of the Capitol Police leadership regarded their approach to Jan. 6 as “all hands on deck” the Capitol Police leadership did not have sufficient assets in place to address the violent and lawless crowd. Capitol Police leadership did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensue after President Trump instructed tens of thousands of his supporters in the Ellipse crowd to march to the Capitol, and then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Although Chief Steven Sund raised the idea of National Guard support, the Capitol Police Board did not request Guard assistance prior to Jan. 6. The Metropolitan Police took an even more proactive approach to Jan. 6, and deployed roughly 800 officers, including responding to the emergency calls for help at the Capitol. Rioters still managed to break their line in certain locations, when the crowd surged forward in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet. The Department of Justice readied a group of federal agents at Quantico and in the District of Columbia, anticipating that Jan. 6 could become violent, and then deployed those agents once it became clear that police at the Capitol were overwhelmed. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security were also deployed to assist.\n\n17. President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6 or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the secretary of defense could, and ultimately did, deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nAnnotation: The question of why it took so long to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol is one of the enduring mysteries of Jan. 6. While the committee sharply criticized Mr. Trump for failing to taking action that day, it also found that there was no evidence the deployment of the Guard was delayed for political reasons.\n\nThe panel voted 9 to 0 to accept the final report and to urge the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against Mr. Trump and his allies in four separate areas of the law.\n\nHere are some takeaways:\n\nThe committee kept its focus on Trump.\n\nThe committee’s hourlong presentation focused almost exclusively on Mr. Trump, essentially ignoring findings about intelligence and security failures at the Capitol before and during the attack. The committee also did not dwell on the information it collected about the rise of domestic extremism.\n\nThe focus on Mr. Trump had been telegraphed for months as the committee drafted its final report, using it primarily as a means to hold Mr. Trump to account for his actions in trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power after a presidential election. As Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican and the panel’s vice chairwoman, put it: “Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one.”\n\nIn one place, the report laid out the facts of how Trump attempted to stay in power.\n\nThe summary of the committee’s final report is a remarkable account of a president’s desperate attempt to stay in office following his election loss to Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\nWhile it breaks no new ground since the panel’s series of public hearings this summer, the report for the first time brings together all the facts in one place.\n\nThe report states that even people around Mr. Trump “ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful.”\n\nThe report laid out, step by step, how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 election: first, by lying about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false; by organizing false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden; by pressuring state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election; and finally, by amassing a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the report states. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe committee revealed new details from two top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe committee revealed on Monday the investigative work it had done since the end of their previous hearings. That included the panel’s first interviews with two of the former president’s top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMs. Hicks, who served as a senior adviser in the White House, said that when she raised concerns with the former president about the actions on Jan. 6 affecting Mr. Trump’s legacy, he responded that “nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.”\n\nThe committee also revealed testimony from Ms. Conway, who described telling Mr. Trump that Jan. 6 was a “terrible day.” She recalled him responding: “No. People are upset. They are very upset.”\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 hurt Trump but did not knock him out of 2024 contention.\n\nThe work of the committee over the past year has already helped to chip away at Mr. Trump’s political standing and his reputation as the nation’s 45th president. Ms. Cheney said again on Monday that Mr. Trump should never “serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump already has announced his pursuit of the presidency again, hoping to reclaim the office he falsely asserts was stolen from him. Despite a rocky campaign announcement and a swirl of potential criminal prosecutions, Mr. Trump remains a central figure in the Republican Party, with strong support across the country. And he has weathered setbacks, both political and legal, before.\n\nThe committee’s legacy is still an open question.\n\nThe legacy of the Jan. 6 committee is now out of the panel’s hands, and will most likely be determined by federal prosecutors in the coming months. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s actions, to determine whether the information sent over by the committee, along with the Justice Department’s own material, warrants charging the former president with any crimes.\n\nThat remains an open question. Members of the committee were firm on Monday in their belief that Mr. Trump and the people around him violated four statutes in the planning and execution of the Capitol attack. They are: obstructing or influencing an official proceeding; conspiring against the U.S. government; making false statements to the government; and engaging in insurrection against the government.\n\nPursuing those charges, or others, against Mr. Trump would be a historic effort to hold the nation’s top official accountable for his actions. But it will be up to the special counsel, and ultimately Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, to decide whether to move forward. Other Justice Department officials will have to decide whether to charge Mr. Trump’s aides as committee members called for.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are already gearing up to discredit the committee when they take control of the House in January. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become the speaker next year, has vowed to investigate the committee’s work and has demanded that the staff and lawmakers preserve records for that purpose.\n\nThe committee has not been a political boon for many of its members.\n\nThe end of the Jan. 6 committee is also the end of the House careers of four of the nine members of the panel.\n\nTwo of them — Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Mr. Kinzinger faced fierce opposition from within his own party because of his frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and his decision to be part of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nTwo others — Ms. Cheney and Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia — lost their House seats in 2022. Ms. Cheney was defeated in her primary campaign in Wyoming after drawing the ire of party officials and voters for her opposition to Mr. Trump and her determination to hold him accountable for Jan. 6. Ms. Luria was defeated in the general election in Virginia.\n\nAll four have said they have no regrets about serving on the committee. But it is unlikely to serve as a political steppingstone for many of its members.\n\nThe panel’s recommendations that charges should be brought were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.\n\nIn presenting the committee’s findings, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”\n\nMr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer John Eastman, an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, concluded that there was evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.\n\nAs for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, Jack Smith, might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.\n\nStill, there has been some overlap between criminal statutes cited by the department and the charges the committee recommended, according to search warrants and subpoenas that have gradually surfaced during the federal inquiry.\n\nOne charge that both the panel and prosecutors have placed at the center of their work is obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. The Justice Department mentioned that count in a warrant used in June to seize the cellphone of Jeffrey Clark, a former department official whom the committee referred for criminal charges on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have already used the obstruction count in nearly 300 criminal cases to describe how the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 disrupted the certification of the election that was taking place there during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDespite its wide use, the statute was never an easy fit for the violence that erupted at the Capitol.\n\nIt was passed into law as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to curb corporate malfeasance by clamping down on things like shredding documents and tampering with witnesses. And defense lawyers have challenged its use in a federal appeals court in Washington, arguing that prosecutors stretched it beyond its original scope and used it to criminalize behavior that closely resembles protest protected by the First Amendment.\n\nStill, the obstruction count could apply much better to Mr. Trump’s behavior than to that of hundreds of ordinary rioters.\n\nThe law requires proving that any interference with a congressional proceeding be done “corruptly.” The committee said in its recommendations that Mr. Trump had clearly acted with a “‘corrupt’ purpose” because he was warned in advance that several of his schemes to maintain his grip on power were illegal.\n\nThe committee also recommended that Mr. Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a count that has been used in several Justice Department cases against both far-right extremists and ordinary rioters who appeared to have planned in advance to storm the Capitol.\n\nAgain, this conspiracy charge may in fact better describe the evidence against Mr. Trump, who, according to the committee, defrauded the public by making constant false claims that the election had been rigged against him.\n\nAnother charge the committee recommended against Mr. Trump and others was conspiracy to make false statements. That count, according to the panel, was warranted because Mr. Trump took part in a wide-ranging scheme to send to Congress and the National Archives fake slates of electors declaring that he was the victor in several key states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe most serious charge the panel has recommended against Mr. Trump is also likely to be the hardest to prove: insurrection. While the Justice Department has won a conviction on a related charge, seditious conspiracy, against Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, and is set to try five members of another far-right group, the Proud Boys, for sedition, it has not charged anyone with insurrection in more than 900 criminal cases.\n\nStill, a federal judge in Washington laid the ground for a potential insurrection case against Mr. Trump in a ruling in February that permitted a series of Jan. 6-related civil cases filed against the former president to move forward.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, said Mr. Trump was not merely exercising his First Amendment right to free speech when he called on the crowd listening to him on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nJudge Mehta also found that there was a reasonable case to be made that Mr. Trump had aided and abetted those in the mob who assaulted the police at the Capitol — in part by waiting so long to call publicly for the rioters to calm down. One of the ways prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection is by showing that he gave “aid and comfort” to other insurrectionists who took part in a rebellion against the government.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': 'The panel voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump over his role.

Here, the committee sets out to show that Trump planned even before the 2020 presidential election to declare prematurely that he had won. It quotes testimony by his campaign team in which they informed Trump that he had lost the election and that there had been no fraud.\n\nThe narrative walks through Trump\'s alleged post-election efforts to retain power, including attempts to replace slates of electors with fake alternate electors who would support him, alleged efforts to subvert the Justice Department by replacing officials who refused to make false statements that would help Trump remain in power and plans to stop Congress\' certification of the election on Jan. 6.\n\nRead the full final Jan. 6 House select committee report here\n\nThe report also lists 11 recommendations to prevent another Jan. 6. Among them: barring Trump from holding any federal or state office in the future and the passage of the Electoral Count Act to clarify the vice president\'s and Congress\' narrow roles in the presidential election and to make it more difficult to overturn the results.\n\nThe committee points out that the Constitution says individuals can be disqualified from holding public office if they ""engaged in an insurrection"" or gave ""aid or comfort"" to one.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday also began releasing transcripts from the months of testimony gathered, starting with 34 witnesses\' interviews. Those witnesses included Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Nick Fuentes, Alex Jones, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelli Ward. In addition to recommending charges against Trump, the committee also recommended charges against Eastman, a law professor who proposed having Vice President Mike Pence refuse to count the electoral ballots of certain states that had voted for Joe Biden.\n\nThe transcripts confirmed many of the witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, including to questions about biographical details. Stone, for example, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights when asked where he resides and his age.\n\nLawyers for Clark, a former Justice Department official who the committee said ""stands out as a participant"" in an alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States, responded to the report with a statement Thursday night attacking the committee. They called it a ""political and public-relations bust"" and said, ""This is why, on its way out the door, the Committee is desperately trying to make a splash with criminal referrals it was obvious from the very start its members were going to make in an effort to try to destroy their conservative political opponents.""\n\nOn Thursday, the panel made public two transcripts from September interviews with Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Hutchison testified before the committee in an explosive public hearing in late June, during which she discussed Trump\'s repeated demands to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and an interaction she learned of between the former president and the head of his security detail in a presidential vehicle after his speech on the Ellipse, which involved Trump allegedly lunging toward him when he was told he could not go to the Capitol.\n\nLater Thursday, the committee release the transcripts of interviews with former Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs; Capitol rioter Stephen Ayres (Part 1, Part 2); former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Justice Department official Ken Klukowski (June 10, 2022), who was an aide to another Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark; and former special assistant to the president Sarah Matthew.\n\nThe committee published introductory materials to the report earlier this week, which included the committee\'s criminal referrals to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and 17 key findings from its investigation.\n\nThe panel recommended the Justice Department pursue at least four criminal charges against former President Donald Trump related to his alleged efforts to thwart the transfer of presidential power: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and incitement, rebellion or insurrection.\n\nDuring the course of its probe, the select committee held 10 public hearings, conducted interviews with more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 1 million pages of material. It issued subpoenas to Trump and some of his closest allies, though ultimately did not speak with the former president or former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe committee\'s hearings, the bulk of which were held over the summer, focused on what investigators said was a multi-part plan by Trump and his allies to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election and keep the former president in office. The pressure campaign involved Pence, state lawmakers, election officials and the Justice Department, and culminated in the Jan. 6 attack, during which a mob of Trump\'s supporters breached the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from re-affirming President Biden\'s electoral win, the panel alleged.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California and a member of the committee, told ""CBS Mornings"" on Wednesday that the decision to refer Trump for possible criminal charges was a ""somber decision to make, and not one we made lightly.""\n\n""We believe that with respect to inciting an insurrection and conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to lie ... that Donald Trump committed all of these offenses,"" Schiff said. ""And as the Congress itself was the victim of some of them, our democracy, all of them, that we had an obligation to report what we knew to the Justice Department.""\n\nTrump, who has launched a 2024 presidential bid, has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt."" He called the criminal referrals ""Fake charges made by the highly partisan Unselect Committee of January 6th"" in response to the release of the introductory materials earlier this week.'}}",96.78571428571429,2

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was one of a handful Republican lawmakers to show up at a Tuesday protest in New York City ahead of former President Donald Trump’s arraignment later in the day. The rally, which Greene led alongside the New York Young Republicans, drew a crowd of a few dozen Trump supporters, counterprotesters, and curious New Yorkers — all of whom appeared to be outnumbered by media.\n\nThe rally in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Court House, was less a protest and more like a bizarro carnival. Trump’s Tuesday arraignment took place on an rare New York spring day, which added to the frenetic vibe, as though everyone was unleashed after a long winter.\n\nThe MAGA hats and flags were out, as were a contingent of counterprotesters, imperfectly separated by metal barriers. New Yorkers mingled among them — an artist, a high schooler with a few free periods — who claimed to have wandered down to Lower Manhattan to witness history, or at least the spectacle. And then there were the reporters, swarming everyone in a red hat or with a halfway decent sign.\n\nBut prominent GOP politicians, not so much. The sparse attendance by other elected Republicans highlighted the limitations of what members of the party might be willing to do for Trump, even though they’ve broadly lambasted the charges against him as politically motivated and unfounded.\n\nGreene’s headlining of the event comes after Trump previously called for his supporters to “protest” the charges, a rallying cry that raised concerns of a repeat of the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when the former president similarly asked supporters to contest the election results. Embattled Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was also spotted by reporters in the crowd of the protest, and was seen headed toward the courthouse where the arraignment was set to take place. Other than that, maybe the highest-profile public figure was the Naked Cowboy.\n\nJanuary 6’s violence — and its legal fallout — have complicated efforts to drum up support for pro-Trump protests. While many lawmakers are eager to show their support for Trump, they’ve largely chosen to do so through fundraising efforts. A previous New York protest on March 20 was also poorly attended, and protests in South Carolina and California drew small crowds this past week as well. Most GOP lawmakers appear unwilling to put themselves in a position where they could be linked to Trump-related violence, and in the face of ongoing trials for insurrectionists, grassroots supporters appear hesitant to do so as well.\n\nThe New York Young Republicans pointedly described the Tuesday rally as a “peaceful protest” that called out the political persecution of Trump’s indictment, with Greene warning participants against violence. The crowd greeted Marjorie Taylor Green’s arrival to the rally with cheers and jeers, but throughout the morning until Trump’s arrival in Lower Manhattan, the protests remained largely peaceful.\n\nRepublicans in general have harshly criticized the indictment and framed it as a way for Democrats to attack Trump yet again. Leaders like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), however, have previously urged “calmness” and pushed back on Trump’s calls for protest. They have assisted with the former president’s efforts to use the indictment to raise money, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) solicited donations on Fox News, for example, and the Trump campaign claims it’s brought in over $7 million in the past few days.\n\nThe lukewarm Republican response to Trump’s calls for protests, however, indicate that many in the GOP are only willing to go so far, particularly as the specter of the January 6 insurrection continues to loom over the party.\n\n“I think they calculate that they can take a goldilocks strategy — stay in the good graces of their base by not attacking him, but maintain plausible deniability in the future by not attending a protest,” says American University government professor David Barker.\n\nTrump is back, and no one seems to know quite what to make of it\n\nTuesday in Collect Pond Park, Trump supporters were angry about Trump’s indictment, but there was also a sense of anticipation: The thing Trump always said would happen — that he’d be targeted by an establishment that was out to get him — did. They were here to defend Trump, to support him, pray for him, and commiserate together.\n\nMelinda, 61, who drove up to New York from outside Fall’s Church, Virginia, sat on a bench in the park, hours before Trump’s arraignment. “I’m here to pray for the safety of the city and the people and President Trump,” she said.\n\nShe added that she loved her president, pointing to a pin of the presidential seal on the collar of the jacket. For her, the charges felt larger than just Trump. “What’s happening is they’re about to open a Pandora’s box. Because now, nobody’s safe,” Melinda said. “Any president, VP, Supreme Court justice, can now be publicly arrested, so I think it will boomerang.”\n\nThe crowd got bigger as the morning wore on and Trump’s arraignment loomed. There were red hats, of course, but maybe not as many as you might think. The rest fell into two camps: folks in sunglasses and T-shirts, as if they were NYC tourists; and the over-the-top. That included a guy in a banana suit — “Banana Republic” costume, as he explained — with a copy of the US Constitution in his hand.\n\nThe closer to Trump’s arraignment it got, the weirder it got, too: a woman, her body painted white, in a diaper. An Abe Lincoln. A guy in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a Trump mask. As inmate Trump worked the crowd, one woman pointed directly at him. “It’s Hillary Clinton,” she said, ignoring his face. “Hey, Hillary, you finally got locked up.”\n\nAnti-Trump protesters also filtered through. Jojo Keys, 39, from Manhattan, said he was an independent who had come to witness history. When Taylor Green entered the park, he jumped up and down, shouting “Liar, liar!”\n\nThere were also “Fuck Joe Biden” cheers and “USA” chants, and there was a cowbell, somewhere, of course. But mostly, the currency was signs. The ones you know: Make America Great, Trump 2024, Stop the Steal, Q. And then some new ones on the scene, some better than others: “Salem 1692 / Bragg 2023.” “From Build Back Better to Biden, Bragg, Banana Republic in 2 Years.”\n\nMichael Austin, a 59-year-old Manhattanite, had the Build Back Better to Banana Republic sign, which he rested at his feet. In his hands, he held a “Fags for Trump” sign. “It is a seven-year-long, slow-rolling constant coup d’etat,” Austin said. “They have used the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the DHS, and foreign spy agencies to persecute a reformer, who came to reform the corrupt system, and they don’t like it.”\n\nPretty much everyone had cameras out, filming or photographing the scene for their own memories, and maybe to make sure that they had evidence in case anything happened.\n\nThough nothing really did. People cheered, they chatted, they waited. Trump arrived at the courthouse in the afternoon, the crowd noting his arrival with helicopters overhead. “Trump is in the house,” one woman called out. But otherwise, the crowd stood, behind a fence and behind rows of television cameras, facing the court house, knowing, at least, that the former president was inside.\n\nThe lingering impact of January 6\n\nTrump’s calls for protests, which the former president posted in March as he anticipated the indictment, follow significant fallout from the January 6 insurrection. The storming of the Capitol ultimately led to five deaths, 140 injured police officers, and hundreds of arrests. It’s also proven to be politically damaging for Republicans following an intensive investigation by Congress’s January 6 committee, with polling showing that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the attack.\n\nConcerns about the violence that occurred on January 6 have hung over these potential rallies as well, with New York Mayor Eric Adams calling on Taylor Greene and other protesters to be on their “best behavior.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have made similar requests of Trump supporters, like McCarthy, who said in mid-March that “there should not be any violence.”\n\nRelatedly, pro-Trump backers have signaled reluctance about these protests amid concerns they could be a trap laid by federal agents, after more than a thousand people have been charged following the insurrection. As CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Zachary Cohen, and Donie O’Sullivan reported, pro-Trump forums have included speculation that these demonstrations were a “set up” intended to pin blame on them for violence caused by other groups, like the antifa or antifascist movement. (On January 6, this incorrect theory was used by some Republicans to obscure the role of Trump supporters in the violence and damage that was caused.) An expert also told CNN that Trump backers may be seeking alternate routes to oppose the indictment including specific targeting of officials like District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe combination of lawmakers’ own apparent political concerns, and Trump supporters’ practical worries about a law enforcement “set up,” seem to have dampened the involvement in protests this week.\n\nFor Republican lawmakers, there’s been an ongoing balancing act regarding their backing for Trump. If they were to actively criticize and condemn him, they risk serious electoral blowback much like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who lost her Republican House primary. Tying themselves too closely to Trump, however, also comes with its own risks, particularly for lawmakers in more moderate states and districts. In the 2022 midterms, election-denier candidates in battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan broadly lost. And there are still a lot of unknowns about Trump’s legal woes, as he faces other potential charges in cases involving overturning the election results and his role in January 6.\n\n“Now they must calculate not just the current rank-and-file GOP rallying around Trump, but also what happens if more indictments tumble down in the coming months,” says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nThese collective factors, it seems, have curbed the interest in these protests for now.\n\nUpdate, 5 pm ET: This story has been updated with crowd reactions throughout the arraignment day.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://thehill.com/homenews/house/588440-greene-gaetz-to-hold-jan-6-presser-after-trump-cancels/', 'Headline': 'Greene, Gaetz to hold Jan. 6 presser after Trump cancels - The Hill', 'Snippet': 'Republican Reps.

The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}}",89.25,2

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department.

Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L.

""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-counter-report-jan-6-security-failures-capitol', 'Headline': 'House Republicans release counter report on Jan. 6 security failures at ...', 'Snippet': 'The Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday.

It said changes to USCP intelligence protocols in the lead-up to Jan. 6 ""caused confusion and rendered a key USCP component ineffective"" during the mob violence.\n\nRepublicans accused former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving of being ""compromised by politics,"" coordinating closely with Pelosi and her staff but leaving GOP lawmakers out of discussions about security. The report said Democratic leaders were concerned over the ""optics"" of deploying the National Guard in response to the riot, given the Black Lives Matter riots that took place in the summer of 2020. The GOP lawmakers alleged these concerns prevented early deployment of the National Guard.\n\n""To make matters worse, systemic issues have crippled the security apparatus for years. USCP line officers were under-trained and ill-equipped to protect the Capitol complex,"" the report said. ""One officer testified to investigators that he went into the fight on January 6, 2021 with nothing but his USCP-issued baseball cap. Even if every USCP officer had been at work that day, their numbers would still have been insufficient to hold off the rioters due to a lack of training and equipment. The USCP was set up to fail, and there have been scant signs of progress toward addressing these weaknesses.""\n\nRepublicans said the evidence gathered in their report came from witnesses and USCP sources whose identities are protected for fear of retaliation. Additionally, the House investigators interviewed USCP Chief Tom Manger, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, and the Assistant Director of the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division Julie Farnam. The investigation also relied on public documents and news reports to supplement their findings.\n\nDEMOCRATS RELEASE REPORT ON TRUMP TAX RETURNS, REVEALING INCOME, TAXES PAID, IRS AUDIT\n\nThe GOP report is meant to supplement a bipartisan report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration last year. That report identified several security, planning and response failures leading up to the riot, including FBI and Homeland Security intelligence officials neglecting to warn of potential violence and USPC unpreparedness.\n\n""The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police Board’s failure to request National Guard assistance prior to January 6th, meant the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) was not activated, staged, and prepared to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol,"" the Senate report found.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly denied GOP allegations that she or her office prevented the National Guard from deploying, or otherwise ignored threats of violence leading up to the riot.\n\nThe Democrat-led Jan. 6 select committee is expected release its final report on the Capitol riot Thursday. Seven Democrats and the two anti-Trump Republicans on the committee, Reps.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/video-nancy-pelosi-january-6-trump-pelosis-power-documentary/', 'Headline': 'How Nancy Pelosi Responded as Jan. 6 and Its Aftermath Unfolded - PBS', 'Snippet': 'On Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election, Nancy Pelosi was among their targets.

Footage captures them shouting, “Where are you, Nancy? We’re looking for you,” and “Yeah, we’re coming, bitch,” before entering her office.\n\nSusan Page, author of the Pelosi biography Madam Speaker, later asked Pelosi if she’d been afraid.\n\n“Nancy said that they would’ve had a fight on their hands. They would’ve had a battle on their hands, because she’s a street fighter,” Page tells FRONTLINE in the opening moments of Pelosi’s Power, embedded above. “And then she lifts up her foot. And, you know, she always wears those 4-inch stiletto heels. And she points at her shoe and says, ‘Besides, I could’ve used these as weapons.’”\n\nIn the hours and days to come, Pelosi would fight — not against the rioters but against the leader who had fueled the insurrection through false claims about a stolen election.\n\n“She really saw [then-President Donald Trump] as so reckless and dangerous,” says Molly Ball, author of Pelosi and a reporter on the new FRONTLINE documentary. “It was such a white-knuckle moment that, whatever the rules said, you just had to hold down the fort and make sure that things didn’t get further out of hand.”\n\nOn Jan. 7, as the above excerpt recounts, Pelosi called the Pentagon’s top general, Mark Milley, and asked about safeguards to prevent “an unstable president” from initiating any rash actions. Then Pelosi went to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and with him called Vice President Mike Pence, another target of the mob, to ask Pence to invoke the 25th amendment. When Pence didn’t take the call, Pelosi moved toward impeachment.\n\n“There was a total void of leadership in our country at that moment,” Judy Lemons, Pelosi’s chief of staff from 1987 to 2002, says in the above excerpt. “Nancy Pelosi was the one leading the country in that moment. She had to be the one dealing with this crisis. And that’s what she did.”\n\n“She found herself in a singular position of power, with a singular responsibility, at this crucial and dangerous moment, and that was not an accident,” Washington Post columnist Matt Bai says at the end of the clip. “That was a long time coming.”\n\nPelosi’s Power, premiering Tuesday, March 22 at 9/8c on PBS, is the first documentary to explore Pelosi’s journey from her 1987 election as a freshman representative (D-Calif.) to the highest-ranking member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The 90-minute film draws on dozens of in-depth interviews: with Pelosi herself; with her family; with her staffers, Congressional colleagues and fierce opponents; with White House insiders; and with journalists and biographers who have chronicled the career of the woman who is now second in line to the presidency.\n\nWhat emerges is a vivid portrait of one of America’s most powerful and polarizing political figures.\n\n“She’s a no-holds-barred politician that was about partisan warfare 100% of the time,” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) says in the film.\n\nSays Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “Nancy Pelosi has never been accused of bringing a knife to a gunfight.”\n\nThe documentary traces Pelosi’s approach to wielding power back to her childhood in Baltimore, where her father was mayor and a U.S. representative. It explores how Pelosi navigated what Lemons calls “entrenched paternalism and crude sexism” after being elected to Congress in 1987 as one of only 23 women in the 435-person chamber. And it investigates her ascent to the speakership as she fought for policies in support of her self-described lifelong ambition: creating a better future for “the children.”\n\n“Nancy Pelosi came up in a historical era where you increasingly did see politics as combat,” Ball says in the documentary. “So she always said, ‘Every morning, I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast, and go out and do battle.’”\n\nIncluding, as the documentary shows, with Donald Trump.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to navigate fallout from Jan. 6, and as questions swirl about whether Democrats and Pelosi will maintain control of the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi’s Power offers an illuminating window into the speaker: who she is, what drives her and why she believes democracy itself is at stake.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/10/nancy-pelosi-january-6-video-trump-capitol-riot.html', 'Headline': 'What the Nancy Pelosi Jan. 6 Footage Revealed - Slate Magazine', 'Snippet': 'Alex Wong/Getty Images.

All the while Donald Trump sat mesmerized by the television in the White House dining room. As committee member Jamie Raskin spelled out, referring to Pelosi and her colleagues, “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.” (That the tape came from the speaker’s daughter has sparked a familiar conspiracy theory, if you’re so inclined.)\n\nThe footage serves as a reminder that much of the real work of a legislative leader like Pelosi is conducted off screen and on the phone: berating, cajoling, huddling with colleagues, as well as bargaining with opponents. A president needs to look like a forceful leader for the camera, but a speaker of the house must be the real thing behind the scenes. While Pelosi has a reputation for being a somewhat stiff public speaker and a middling communicator with the press—and, particularly among the leftward wing of the party, for peddling outdated politics—what’s much more central to her job is formulating priorities (“We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory”) and wrangling other public officials to pitch in (“Imagine this was the Pentagon or the White House under siege”). Even if you believe that Pelosi is very, very good at all this, we just don’t often get to see her do it very often.\n\nThe committee intercut scenes of Pelosi and Chuck Schumer coping with the crisis with shots of rioters baying for Pelosi to be brought out and delivered to the mob along with Mike Pence. Who knows what they would have done if they’d actually got their hands on either one. Pelosi, like the rest of us, surely didn’t see that chilling footage until later, but she knew the rioters were rampaging through the Capitol, ransacking offices and smearing feces. She was aware that even after most of them were ejected, a tenacious straggler could still be hiding on the premises, capable of violence, and favoring her as his target. She certainly knows how much such people really, really hate her, and that may be the most sincere testimonial to her competence.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/13/pelosi-congressional-leaders-capitol-january-6-hearing-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': '‘Do you believe this?’: New video shows Pelosi’s reaction ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House January 6 select committee revealed never-before-seen footage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders reacting to the Capitol attack from a secure location.', 'Full_text': ""1.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election. The footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the new footage:\n\nSchumer pleads with acting AG to ask Trump to call off rioters\n\nThis clip shows a tense conversation between then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen where Schumer asks Rosen to tell Trump to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol.\n\n“Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol?,” Schumer says. Rosen sidesteps the question, saying instead, “So, uh, as you might guess we’re coordinating as quickly and as” – at which point Schumer jumps in to say, “no, no, no, please answer my question,” before shouting, “answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\nAt the start of the clip, Schumer can be seent shouting at the then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\n“DC has requested the National Guard and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer says. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged … We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nSchumer then hangs up the phone and tells Pelosi who is sitting nearby, “They have not denied it. I spoke to the Secretary of the Army. He’s given the full OK to (inaudible) the National Guard. He said it was not denied.”\n\nPelosi talks about punching Trump\n\nPelosi can be seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nLater, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this.

I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying “we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden’s win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building. Pence gives Pelosi and Schumer a heads up that law enforcement officials believe the House and Senate will be able to reconvene in “roughly an hour.”\n\nThe video demonstrates how Pence worked to relay information to congressional leaders on the day of the attack. When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, “Good news!”\n\n“They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they’re confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that’s helpful,” Pence says. Pelosi thanks him afterward.\n\nThis clip shows in lengthy detail how the situation at the Capitol escalated on January 6 with rioters swarming the building and eventually breaching it. It shows rioters screaming obscenities directed at a variety of people including law enforcement officers, Pelosi and Pence.\n\nLater Pelosi is seen sheltering with Schumer and other congressional leaders. They pass a phone around with photos of the scene unfolding at the Capitol. “Oh my God. They broke into the Senate chamber,” Schumer says.\n\nA television is turned on showing footage of the attack. “Oh my God, they’re just breaking windows,” Pelosi says, reacting to what she sees on the screen. “It’s just horrendous. All at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nLater, a group of bipartisan congressional leaders huddle around a phone to speak with Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has message of urgency for Miller, saying, “we’re in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\nMiller responds that he got the message, “loud and clear.”\n\nPelosi is later seen speaking with Pence on the phone. She asks him how he’s doing and expresses concern for his safety. “Don’t let anybody know where you are,” she warns.\n\nPelosi, Pence discuss personal safety, contingency plans\n\nPerhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi, Schumer talk with Army secretary\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair.

The information ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — Transcripts of interviews with law enforcement officials released this week by the Jan. 6 committee reveal the panel learned that numerous security concerns had been raised in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMany of the revelations came in interviews with high-ranking individuals such as former Secret Service and White House official Anthony Ornato; former executive director of the National Capitol Threat Intelligence Center Donell Harvin; former Deputy FBI Director David Bowdich; Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee; former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund; and House Staff Director Jamie Fleet.\n\nBut some of the new information came from questions posed to those officials by Jan. 6 committee staffers based on details they had gathered in the course of the 18-month investigation.\n\nMuch of that information, mentioned by investigators during the interviews, was not included in the appendix of the committee\'s final report that addressed law enforcement and intelligence failures. For the most part, Jan. 6 committee leaders decided against focusing the final report on how law enforcement came to be so underprepared for the attack.\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence from news reports and court proceedings that illustrate how federal law enforcement officials were in possession of ample information that indicated Jan. 6 was going to be violent. As NBC News first reported last month, staffers were informed that chapters prepared by committee staff — including material focused on law enforcement and intelligence failures — would be cut from the final version.\n\nAmong the revelations from the transcripts: One FBI employee wrote in a Dec. 26, 2020, memo about planning for Jan. 6 that was unfolding on a pro-Trump forum called TheDonald.\n\n“They think they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed, and it will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,"" read the notification in the eGuardian system, which is meant to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials coordinate. ""They believe that since the election was stolen, that it’s their constitutional right to over take the government and during this coup no U.S. laws apply. Another group of Proud Boys will be in DC already and are planning on blocking the roads with their cars in order to stop traffic.""\n\nNBC News previously reported that one of the FBI’s own confidential sources informed the bureau on the day that Trump sent his Dec. 19, 2020, “will be wild” tweet about Jan. 6 that far-right groups saw it as a “call to arms.” The FBI received numerous tips about the potential for violence on Jan. 6, including from the son of a Texas man who ultimately came to the Capitol with a gun, and the bureau briefed other law enforcement entities about threats, including intelligence that suggested the Oath Keepers had set up armed ""quick reaction forces"" in Virginia that were set to come into D.C. at Trump\'s command. Two members of the Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy at a trial that ended last month, and three others pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee transcripts detailed the challenges facing the FBI in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Days before the attack, the FBI lost use of the program it had been using to track threats on social media, as the bureau transitioned to a new product to gather open source information. An FBI intelligence analyst raised concerns about that on New Year\'s Eve, as threats about Jan. 6 continued to increase.\n\n“We have an urgent need for the DataMinr replacement to be on and active starting on January 4th in support of some potential issues in the D.C. area,” the analyst wrote in a Dec. 31, 2020, email. “The sudden discontinuation is most untimely as much of our crisis response funnels through DataMinr.”\n\nBowdich, in his interview with Jan. 6 investigators, said there was a lot happening at the bureau in the days before the attack: There had been a major cyber intrusion; a bomb had gone off in downtown Nashville, Tenn.; the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani was approaching; and the bureau was receiving a lot of intelligence about the potential for violence, much of which was publicly available on social media.\n\n“I wish you could see the volume,” Bowdich told the committee, referring to the number of threats the FBI reviews. “It is off the charts. ... One of our greatest challenges is social media today.”\n\nThe bureau did make efforts to try to disrupt extremists\' travel to D.C.; the FBI\'s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section messaged all domestic terrorism assistant special agents in charge across the country to determine whether any of the extremists they were watching were planning to go to D.C. on Jan. 6.\n\nUltimately, the FBI set up a national command post for the event inside the Strategic Information Operations Center at FBI headquarters in Washington.\n\n“The noise seemed to be growing as we got closer to the event, and it reached a point of we just didn’t know what was going to happen,"" Bowdich said. ""Sometimes you just get a sense for it when you’ve been doing it.”\n\nSome of those officials interviewed by the committee about the intelligence failures made clear they thought there were problems that needed to be fixed, both before Jan. 6 and going forward.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need intelligence. I mean, everybody knew that people were directed to come there by the President. November was a run-up, December was practice, and January 6th was executed,” said House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, who was head of the D.C. National Guard on Jan. 6. The information publicly available made clear that Jan. 6 “was going to be a big deal,” he said.\n\nSund, the former Capitol Police chief who resigned the day after the attack, said that intelligence he received didn\'t ""send up a bunch of red flags for me"" because most protests target Congress. Harvin, the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for D.C., told the committee that Sund shouldn\'t characterize what happened as an intelligence failure, but as a failure to act on intelligence.\n\n“He said it was intelligence failure,"" Harvin said. ""It may have been an intelligence failure on his agency’s part and a failure to properly contextualize and pervade the threat environment, but it wasn’t an intelligence failure at large.”\n\nContee, the D.C. police chief, said there needed to be better sharing of intelligence, and that he would have liked to have known about a Capitol Police report about some of the threats related to Jan. 6.\n\n“I don’t think I want to get notified about Armageddon through an email,"" Contee said. ""That would not be my preferred notification, right?”\n\nWhen asked about what she thought the intelligence failures were, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was blunt.\n\n""People didn\'t think that these white nationalists would overthrow the Capitol building,"" the Democratic mayor said.'}}",89.21428571428571,2

Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230906/biden-admin-oversteps-authority-to-attack-law-abiding-gun-owners-again', 'Headline': 'Biden Admin Oversteps Authority to Attack Law-Abiding Gun Owners, Again', 'Snippet': 'The Biden Administration claims that these changes can help move federal law towards so-called “universal background checks,” but that is potentially a trap for law-abiding gun owners.', 'Full_text': ""Last Thursday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) announced a new proposed rule on the “Definition of ‘Engaged in the Business’ as a Dealer in Firearms.” \xad\xad--the definition that controls when individuals engage in sufficient commerce in firearms so as to need to be licensed under federal law as a Federal Firearms Licensee (“FFL”). Under the proposed rule, Biden’s ATF would go well beyond statutory authority to fabricate presumptions of when an individual needs be an FFL, and the rule itself acknowledges its unlawfulness.\n\nBiden's ATF is using the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (“BSCA”) that was signed into law in 2022 as the impetus for the proposed rule. For background, the BSCA amended the definition of “Engaged in the Business” to read:\n\n“a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to predominantly earn a profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms,” (18 U.S.C 921(a)21)\n\nand further defined “to predominantly earn a profit” to mean:\n\n“that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection.” (18 U.S.C. 921(a)(22).\n\nATF’s recently proposed rule now aims to create several presumptions when a person is “engaged in the business,” despite the abovementioned definition that contains no such presumptions.\n\nThe law is clear that a person “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms” is not “engaged in the business.” Despite these clear allowances, the proposed rule contains a presumption regarding renting a table at a gun show, collector show, or other swap meet. This conduct is clearly protected under federal statute if the person is only making “occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases” or if the person is using the table to sell all or part of a collection of firearms.\n\nThe presumptions go even further, and some would deter what many would consider responsible behavior when selling a firearm. There are presumptions of being “engaged in the business” where a person includes the factory packaging with “like new” firearms or where a person keeps detailed records regarding their firearm sales.\n\nOf course, “factory packaging” could include the instruction manual, the included factory lock, and the case (which is likely suitable for safely transporting or storing the firearm). All of these items could be helpful to a new buyer (especially if the buyer is a first time gun owner), but the proposed rule would effectively punish including these items with a firearm.\n\nAnd, treating detailed records regarding sales as evidence of a person being “engaged in business” just incentivizes sellers to keep no records at all. Apparently, the government is fine with making firearm tracing all that more difficult.\n\nRemarkably, the government doesn’t even believe these made-up presumptions are lawful. The proposed rule itself notes that “[t]he rebuttable presumptions [] shall not apply to any criminal case, although they may be useful to courts in criminal cases, for example, when instructing juries regarding permissible inferences.” One might wonder why a new proposed definition of a term that is used in federal criminal statutes cannot be used in criminal cases. The answer is likely that the government knows their own position is unlawful and they do not believe the regulation has any chance of surviving the application of the rule of lenity in a criminal case, where the accused is given the benefit of the doubt when a statutory term is ambiguous.\n\nBeyond the tacit admission of the unlawfulness of the rule, the government does get one thing right. They correctly admit that the statute does not give them the authority to set a limit on the number of firearm transactions that a person can engage in before needing to be licensed. However, in true government form, after making this admission, the rule goes on to describe how even a single transaction could trigger the need to be licensed. So much for the statutory requirement that a person engage in “repetitive purchase and resale” before needing a license.\n\nThe Biden Administration claims that these changes can help move federal law towards so-called “universal background checks,” but that is potentially a trap for law-abiding gun owners. Transferring a firearm through a licensed dealer to run a background check does nothing to help a seller if they meet the government’s new expanded definition of “engaged in the business.” In fact, doing so could provide more evidence to the ATF to use against a seller that they claim is dealing in firearms without an FFL.\n\nMoreover, it’s important to note that this proposed rule and push to require more people become licensed dealers is occurring under the backdrop of the Biden Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, where the ATF is shutting down licensed dealers at an unprecedented pace. The irony that Biden wants to require as many individuals as possible become licensed dealers, while at the same time making it as difficult as possible be an FFL.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/us/gun-owners-liberal-women-minority-reaj/index.html', 'Headline': 'Liberal, female and minority: America’s new gun owners aren’t ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Fred Pleitgen explains how Russia may react to Biden’s approval of long-range missile use by Ukraine ... liberal and conservative.” ...

A licensed firearms instructor and dealer, Joseph decided to open Fortune Firearms in December to serve a growing and rapidly changing clientele.\n\n“There is a huge uptick in female owners,” Joseph said. “Women are getting trained; women are carrying… liberal and conservative.”\n\nProof of that change pulled up Joseph’s long, dusty driveway in the San Jacinto Valley just before 10 a.m. for a Saturday social, of sorts. A group of seven African American women stepped out of their cars seemingly eager to start their first firearms training session.\n\n“Our society and climate is changing… it’s just better to be prepared for your own safety and protection. That’s how we feel,” Laronya Day, who organized the outing, said.\n\nNow in their early 50s, the women have been friends since they were kids in Los Angeles, about two and a half hours from Joseph’s business. And most of them acknowledge they lean left politically.\n\n“Do you have some friends who would be totally turned off by this?” we asked Charlean Ward. “Absolutely,” she responded. “That’s their choice; I’m exercising my choice.”\n\nJamie Beverly looked less certain, if not uneasy. “Seeing all the guns on the table, I was like ‘ugh,’” Beverly said. “Would you ever want to carry?” we asked her. “I don’t think so,” she whispered.\n\nOver the course of nearly two hours, Joseph led a detailed instruction, teaching the women about everything from the types of handguns best suited for self-defense to how to load and disarm a firearm. Only after the women had repeatedly loaded the cartridge, inserted the magazine, chambered the gun, and then doing it all in reverse, did Joseph determine they were ready to fire at their paper targets.\n\nEchoes of gunfire rippled through the rural valley as the women pulled their triggers.\n\n‘I definitely am more closeted being a gun owner’\n\nAbout an hour east of Los Angeles, Yessica Mendez and her wife Crisia Regalado met with their instructor Tom Nguyen at Burro Canyon Shooting Park. But Regalado, 25, admits she at first wanted nothing to do with guns.\n\n“Just the sounds… the vibrations of each impact… made me very jittery and shaky and I had to excuse myself out of the range,” Regalado recalled. “I don’t know, it just triggered something inside of me and it made me scared.”\n\nMendez, 30, was equally disinterested in guns at first. But in recent years she’s felt a growing need for self-protection.\n\n“I’m a Mexican woman in a same-sex relationship; I need to feel safe. I need to feel protected,” Mendez said. “And right now the laws and the things that are going on don’t make me feel safe and don’t make me feel protected.”\n\nShe convinced her wife to join her for a training session with Nguyen, who began LA Progressive Shooters in 2020.\n\n“I never intended to become an instructor, but the need from the community was there,” Nguyen said. “And there’s also folks from my own liberal community who see me as, ‘oh you like guns you must be a gun nut.’ But that’s not really it at all.”\n\nNguyen says his clients are mostly liberal and from all backgrounds, genders and sexual orientations. He prides himself on creating an inclusive student base.\n\n“The more I educate those who are formally anti-gun the more they actually realize that there’s more nuance to it,” he said.\n\nBoth Mendez and Regalado now have their own guns and are working toward getting their concealed carry permits. But they avoid talking about their guns with friends, who they say are firmly anti-gun.\n\n“They’re really not open to understanding,” Mendez said. Adding that she feels more comfortable discussing her same-sex relationship with friends than her guns. “I definitely am more closeted being a gun owner, for fear of retaliation.”\n\nFinding common ground at the range\n\nBoth Mendez and Regalado at first worried about the type of people they encounter at the gun range, many of whom, they say, advertise their conservative politics in what they’re wearing or listening to.\n\n“It’s mostly all men, mostly all white men, older men like 70s, 80s,” Mendez said. “Seeing people looking at us, and kind of just staring… It always makes us more uncomfortable. Because we’re like, ‘oh my God are they going to come and tell us, like, get out of here… you don’t belong here.’”\n\nInstead, they’ve gotten a different reaction.\n\n“They’re like, ‘Hey, you’re doing well, but can I show you something that might help you more?,” Mendez said.\n\nMendez says not only has it changed her impression of those individuals, but she also believes it’s given some a different perception of people like her.\n\n“When I (came) back the next day, (one of the men) was like, ‘Hey! I saw your wife out there – she looks nice. Tell her I said ‘hi’.”\n\nStill, as a Mexican-American immigrant in a same-sex marriage Mendez feels pulled in different directions politically.\n\n“But at the end of the day I have to choose. Am I going to choose guns? Or am I going to choose my relationship? And I will always choose my relationship, but it’s just like a shame that we can’t come together and feel safe,” she said.\n\nDe-stigmatizing lawful gun ownership\n\nGun sales in one of the country’s few black-owned gun shops, Redstone Firearms in Burbank, California, soared post-pandemic and have remained steady, according to co-owner Jonathan Solomon.\n\n“It’s not just one demographic. It’s not just one ethnic group. There’s just not one level of income… it’s a wide variety of folks that come in here now,” he said.\n\nWhile white men have the highest rates of gun ownership in the US, one survey shows that in the first half of 2021 roughly 90% of retailers saw a surge in gun sales to African Americans. The same survey found that about 80% of retailers reported an increase in firearm purchases by Hispanic and Asian Americans.\n\nSolomon, a former police officer, opened the shop about nine years ago with his wife Geneva. He says his new, diverse customers are primarily buying their first gun for a shared reason: self-protection. But he warns them to pay close attention to the rapidly changing regulations on firearms.\n\n“It’s a consistent education when it comes to gun laws, especially in California,” Solomon said.\n\nCalifornia is consistently rated among the states with the toughest gun laws. There are strict policies aimed at dissuading hasty gun purchases, including a 10-day cooling off period from when you buy a gun to when you can take it out of the store. And getting a concealed carry permit in places like Los Angeles can take more than a year and include background checks and interviews.\n\n“It’s really convenient to think that if we just ban an object, if we just ban guns, then all of our problems would be solved – all of society’s problems would be solved – but that’s not true,” said firearms instructor Nguyen.\n\nNguyen said more and more residents are willing to put in the time and go through the hurdles to legally buy and carry a gun. And he says most of his clients support tough gun regulation so long as there’s clarity, consistency and still a path toward legal gun ownership. He only hopes they incorporate education and training into that process.\n\n“I want to de-stigmatize lawful and responsible gun ownership,” Nguyen said.\n\n‘I just feel liberated’\n\nAfter completing their two-hour class at Fortune Firearms, most of the group of seven childhood friends were noticeably more comfortable in their new-found knowledge.\n\n“I just feel liberated,” Ward said. “I feel like, let’s move to the next step: license to carry, get the concealed weapon.”\n\nData from Harvard found that more than half of new gun owners are likely to be women. Joseph says many of her clients are more liberal women who don’t advertise that they’re carrying.\n\n“Most people have (in mind) the cookie-cutter firearm owner… right-wing…. But then there’s the other side that is quiet. They own guns. They’re buying them. They’re stockpiling ammo. It’s just not on their Facebook pages and it’s not their profile pictures,” she said.\n\nDay is now planning to move forward with carrying after Joseph’s class. “With all the things that you see on the news, things are happening more… in so many public areas, movie theaters, Walmarts, grocery stores…. It’s like there’s no limit now,” she said.\n\nBut gun ownership is not for everyone. Even after their course, within the close-knit group of friends there are differing opinions toward firearms.\n\n“I think it’s great that more people are being educated and taking steps to protect themselves and protect their families,” Beverly said. “But for me personally, I’m still leery. I don’t think I would purchase (a gun).”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/gun-groups-are-reveling-charges-hunter-biden-rcna105283', 'Headline': 'Some gun groups are reveling in the charges against Hunter Biden - NBC News', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden has been harassing gun owners, the Gun Owners of America said, and ""his son should be receiving the same treatment and scrutiny as all of us.""

The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic.\n\nTwo of the charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, while the third carries a maximum sentence of five years. Former federal prosecutors have told NBC News those type of charges are rarely brought as standalone charges against defendants without a criminal record.\n\nIn July, Hunter Biden struck a plea agreement with prosecutors that would have made the gun case against him go away in two years if he stayed out of trouble and agreed to never again buy a firearm, but negotiations broke down in August before it was finalized.\n\nAccording to a court filing in that case, Biden was using crack cocaine during the period when he bought the revolver from a federally licensed firearms dealer in Delaware in October 2018, and denied he was using drugs on the federal form.\n\nHe wound up possessing the gun for 11 days, and during that time “he purchased and used crack cocaine regularly,” the filing said. The gun was later found in his car along with drug paraphernalia, and was “subsequently discarded in a trashcan outside a supermarket in Greenville, Delaware,” it said.\n\nNow Hunter Biden\'s defense may align with the Second Amendment advocates\' goals — and against his father\'s calls for tougher gun laws.\n\nHis attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday he plans on challenging the constitutionality of the laws Hunter Biden is charged with breaking, noting ""recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional.""'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/27/guns-us-republicans-democrats/', 'Headline': 'Americans are buying guns — but maybe not the Americans you think', 'Snippet': 'Since 2019, NBC found a 17-point increase in reported gun ownership by Black Americans.

It also deserves some context.\n\nA few things are clear. One is that Americans own a lot of guns. Another, considering a slightly different facet, is that a lot of Americans own guns. A third is that the number of guns being purchased has increased dramatically over the past few decades.\n\nWe can see that in the number of background checks completed by the FBI each month. This is not a perfect reflection of the number of guns sold, since background checks can also accompany permit renewals (as in Kentucky). But it’s a decent measure of the increase in sales since the beginning of the century.\n\nMost notable on that chart (which shows background checks relative to population each month) is the surge in 2020. There were more than 1,000 background checks per 100,000 U.S. residents in March 2020 as the pandemic emerged. That June, with protests erupting around the country, the number neared 1,100 per 100,000 residents. In January 2021, in the wake of the Capitol riot and the inauguration of a Democratic president seen as more likely to sign new restrictions on purchases, the figure topped 1,300 per 100,000 residents.\n\nFrom February 2020 through January 2021, there were 41.3 million background checks conducted.\n\nThat said, though, other measures of gun ownership show a more modest change. In fact, the biannual General Social Survey (GSS) indicates that the percentage of Americans indicating they have a gun at home has remained fairly steady over the past decade. There was a jump in 2021 and 2022, but a modest one.\n\nThe GSS data suggest that the reason for that uptick is that Republicans — who over the past decade or so have been much more likely to own guns — were more likely to say they had a firearm at home. But, in keeping with NBC’s findings, so did Democrats.\n\n(The charts in this article use average GSS values over the preceding five years to smooth out trends over time. Independents who lean toward a party are included with that party’s data.)\n\nThere was some increase in reported gun ownership in suburban areas and a slight rise in rural areas, according to the GSS. The heaviest growth, though, was in urban areas — particularly in the 12 largest metropolitan statistical areas.\n\nOverlapping party and region, the GSS suggests that a long downward slide among rural Democrats reversed in recent years, as urban Republicans and Democrats were both more likely to report gun ownership.\n\nThere was also a marked increase in reported gun ownership among Black Americans, something also seen in the NBC data. Since 2019, NBC found a 17-point increase in reported gun ownership by Black Americans. The GSS shows an increase in the five-year average from 8 percent in 2017 to 22 percent in 2022.\n\nThe GSS numbers are uniformly lower than the NBC ones. But the changes by race and party broadly track: more ownership among those who live in cities and among Black Americans.\n\nOf course, we’re talking about increases to relatively small numbers, particularly when compared with the numbers for rural Americans and Republicans. In the GSS data, only those two groups saw a majority of respondents indicating that they owned guns. The upward shift among more-Democratic constituencies are noteworthy precisely because they’re unexpected.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the ...', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/03/28/1166577083/biden-guns-congress', 'Headline': 'Biden pushes for assault ban, but GOP leaders remain opposed : NPR', 'Snippet': 'Biden pushes for assault ban, ...

The legislation expanded that to include dating partners, rather than just spouses and former spouses.\n\nTexas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who was a lead negotiator on that bipartisan gun deal, said Tuesday the focus in the Senate has been on background checks, to prevent those with mental health problems or criminal records from purchasing or possessing firearms.\n\n""That is the area where we\'ve had bipartisan consensus,"" he told reporters.\n\n""The only thing I hear the administration arguing for is an assault weapons ban, which would mean, I suppose that the 16 million people who own semiautomatic rifles would have to give those up — they\'d be confiscated,"" Cornyn said.\n\n""I don\'t know what other purpose would be served,"" he said, adding: ""If there\'s something that can be done while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, I\'m certainly open to talking about it.""\n\nBut Cornyn said there weren\'t any talks with the bipartisan Senate group that crafted last year\'s package that the president signed, and he cautioned it was too early to know specific details about the shooting in Nashville to propose a specific legislative response.\n\nAn assault-style weapons ban doesn\'t have a political future in the Republican-controlled House or in the Senate, where Democrats have a very narrow majority.\n\nCornyn said the enhanced background checks of the 2022 legislation is ""actually working pretty well.""\n\n""The director of the FBI has told us that the national criminal background check system already has stopped the sale of about 100 different gun transactions to juveniles or people purchasing with juvenile records showing they\'re disqualified by virtue of mental illness or crime,"" he said.\n\nHouse Democrats discussed efforts to increase pressure for legislative action at their weekly caucus meeting Tuesday\n\nAccording to a source present in the meeting, leaders urged members to continue pressing House GOP leaders to take up gun control measures.\n\nSouth Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn is reintroducing his bill to close the so-called ""Charleston loophole"" that allows the sale of a gun even when background check isn\'t complete.\n\nA group of Democrats — Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Lucy McBath of Georgia, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Jerry Nadler of New York — are calling on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to schedule a vote on the assault weapons ban that passed the House last year.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-25/emboldened-biden-dems-push-ban-on-so-called-assault-weapons', 'Headline': 'Emboldened Biden and Democrats push to revive the assault weapons ban', 'Snippet': 'When Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Biden speaks about the “scourge” of gun violence, his focus returns to reviving a ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe reiterated that call this week after shootings in Colorado and Virginia: Biden wants to sign into law a renewed ban on high-powered guns that have the capacity to kill many people very quickly.\n\n“The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick,” Biden said on Thanksgiving Day. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.”\n\nAfter the mass killing last Saturday at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, he said in a statement: “When will we decide we’ve had enough? ... We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”\n\nWhen Biden and other lawmakers talk about assault weapons, they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semiautomatic long rifles, such as the AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading. By comparison, New York Police Department officers carry a handgun that shoots about half that much.\n\nA weapons ban is far off in a closely divided Congress. But Biden and the Democrats have become increasingly emboldened in pushing for stronger gun controls — and doing so with no clear electoral consequences.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed legislation in July to revive a 1990s-era ban on assault weapons, with Biden’s vocal support. And the president pushed a ban nearly everywhere that he campaigned this year.\n\nIn the midterm elections, Democrats kept control of the Senate and Republicans were able to claim a House majority by a narrower margin than they had expected.\n\nThe tough talk follows passage in June of a landmark bipartisan bill on gun laws, and it reflects steady progress that gun control advocates have been making in recent years.\n\n“I think the American public has been waiting for this message,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been the Senate’s leading advocate for stronger gun restrictions since the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. “There has been a thirst from voters, especially swing voters, young voters, parents, to hear candidates talk about gun violence, and I think Democrats are finally sort of catching up with where the public has been.”\n\nJust over half of voters want to see nationwide gun policy made more strict, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide conducted for the Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About 3 in 10 want gun policy kept as is, and 14% prefer looser gun laws.\n\nThere are clear partisan divides. About 9 in 10 Democrats want stricter gun laws, compared with about 3 in 10 Republicans. About half of Republicans want gun laws left as they are, and one-quarter want to see gun laws be made less strict.\n\nOnce banned in the United States, the high-powered firearms are now the weapon of choice among young men responsible for many of the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later, unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban.\n\nWhen he was governor of Florida, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott signed gun control laws in the wake of mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he has consistently opposed weapons bans, arguing like many of his Republican colleagues that most gun owners use them lawfully.\n\n“People are doing the right thing; why would we take away their weapons?” Scott asked as the Senate was negotiating gun legislation last summer. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nHe said more mental health counseling, assessments of troubled students and law enforcement on campus make more sense.\n\n“Let’s focus on things that actually would change something,” Scott said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long called for stricter gun laws, arguing that the availability of these weapons makes people less safe and makes their jobs more dangerous.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore, who heads the country’s third-largest police department, said it just makes sense to talk about restricting firearms when gun violence is rising nationwide, and consider what the government can do to make the streets safer. He said he is grateful Biden is bringing it up so much.\n\n“This isn’t a one-and-done,” Moore said of the shooting last weekend at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. “These things are evolving all the time, in other cities, at any moment another incident happens. It’s crying out for the federal government, for our legislators, to go out and make this change,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, six people were shot dead at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Va. Over the last six months there has been a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., a massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas, and the Fourth of July parade killing of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.\n\nThe legislation that Biden signed in June will, among other things, help states put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged to be dangerous.\n\nBut a ban was never on the table.\n\nA 60-vote threshold in the Senate means some Republicans must be on board. Most are steadfastly opposed, arguing it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\n“I’d rather not try to define a whole group of guns as being no longer available to the American public,” Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said. “For those of us who have grown up with guns as part of our culture, and we use them as tools — there’s millions of us, there’s hundreds of millions of us — that use them lawfully.”\n\nIn many states where the bans have been enacted, the restrictions are being challenged in court, gaining strength from a Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights.\n\n“We feel pretty confident, even despite the arguments made by the other side, that history and tradition as well as the text of the 2nd Amendment are on our side,” said David Warrington, chairman and general counsel for the National Foundation for Gun Rights.\n\nBiden was instrumental in helping secure the 1990s ban as a senator. The White House has noted statistics showing that while it was in place, mass shootings declined, and when it expired in 2004, shootings tripled.\n\nThe reality is complicated. The data on the effectiveness is mixed and there is a sense that other measures that are not as politically fraught might actually be more effective, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.”\n\nPolitically, the ban sparked a backlash, even though the final law was a compromise version of the initial bill, he said.\n\n“The gun community was furious,” Spitzer said.\n\nThe ban has been blamed in some circles for the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1994, though subsequent research has shown that the loss was probably more about strong, well-funded conservative candidates and district boundaries, Spitzer said.\n\nStill, after Democrat Al Gore, who supported stricter gun laws, lost the 2000 White House race to Republican George W. Bush, Democrats largely backed off the issue until the Sandy Hook shooting a decade ago. Even after that, it was not a campaign topic until the 2018 midterms.\n\nNow, gun control advocates see progress.\n\n“The fact that the American people elected a president who has long been a vocal and steadfast supporter of bold gun safety laws — and recently reelected a gun-sense majority to the Senate — says everything you need to know about how dramatically the politics on this issue have shifted,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our-communities-safer/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Reduce Gun ...', 'Snippet': 'President Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers ...', 'Full_text': ""Today, in Monterey Park, California, President Biden will announce an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the number of background checks conducted before firearm sales, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. The Executive Order will also keep more guns out of dangerous hands by increasing the effective use of “red flag” laws, strengthen efforts to hold the gun industry accountable, and accelerate law enforcement efforts to identify and apprehend the shooters menacing our communities. President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors.\n\nPresident Biden is traveling to Monterey Park to grieve with the families and community impacted by the mass shooting that claimed 11 lives and injured nine others in January. Monterey Park is part of a growing list of communities all across the country that are forever changed due to gun violence—not only mass shootings, but also daily acts of gun violence that may not make national headlines.\n\nLast year, President Biden signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30 years. When celebrating the Act’s passage, he called on Congress to seize the bipartisan momentum and advance additional commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. Again and again, he has called for Congress to act, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, closing the dating violence restraining order loophole, and repealing gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.\n\nAs he continues to call on Congress to act, President Biden will do everything he can to reduce gun violence and save lives. That is why, over the past two years, President Biden has taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president at this point in their presidency.\n\nThe President’s new Executive Order to reduce gun violence includes the following additional actions, all of which fall within existing executive authority and outside of the right protected by the Second Amendment:\n\nKeeping guns out of dangerous hands\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nIncrease the number of background checks by ensuring that all background checks required by law are conducted before firearm purchases, moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation. A large majority of Americans support background checks and agree it’s common sense to check whether someone is a felon or domestic abuser before allowing them to buy a gun. The President will continue to call on Congress to pass universal background check legislation. In the meantime, he is directing the Attorney General to do everything he can to ensure that firearms sellers who do not realize they are required to run background checks under existing law, or who are willfully violating existing law, become compliant with background check requirements. Specifically, the President is directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying, as appropriate, the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, as updated by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This move would mean fewer guns will be sold without background checks, and therefore fewer guns will end up in the hands of felons and domestic abusers. The President is also directing the Attorney General to develop and implement a plan to prevent former federally licensed firearms dealers, whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered, from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.\n\nImprove public awareness and increase appropriate use of extreme risk protection (“red flag”) orders and safe storage of firearms. 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws, allowing trusted community members to petition a court to determine whether an individual is dangerous, and then to temporarily remove an individual’s access to firearms. However, these laws are only effective if the public knows when and how to use red flag orders. President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders, including by partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders. In addition, President Biden is directing members of his Cabinet to expand existing federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms.\n\nAddress the loss or theft of firearms during shipping. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data indicates an over 250% increase in the number of firearms reported as lost or stolen during shipment between federally licensed firearms dealers, from roughly 1,700 in 2018 to more than 6,100 in 2022. President Biden is directing the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers.\n\nHolding the gun industry accountable\n\nThe Executive Order directs the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nProvide the public and policymakers with more information regarding federally licensed firearms dealers who are violating the law. Gun dealers violating federal law put us all at risk by increasing the likelihood that firearms will fall into dangerous hands. The President is directing the Attorney General to publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, ATF records from the inspection of firearms dealers cited for violation of federal firearm laws. This information will empower the public and policymakers to better understand the problem, and then improve our laws to hold rogue gun dealers accountable.\n\nUse the Department of Defense’s acquisition of firearms to further firearm and public safety practices. The Department of Defense buys a large number of firearms and other weapons to protect and serve our country. The President is directing the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through Department of Defense acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law.\n\nPresident Biden is also encouraging the independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to all civilians, including through the use of military imagery.\n\nAdditional steps to make our communities safer and support communities impacted by gun violence\n\nThe Executive Order will direct the President’s Cabinet to:\n\nHelp catch shooters by accelerating federal law enforcement’s reporting of ballistics data. The National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) allows federal, state, and local law enforcement to match fired cartridge casings to the guns from which they were fired, making it easier for law enforcement to connect multiple crime scenes and catch shooters. In order to maximize NIBIN’s effectiveness, federal, state, and local law enforcement all have an important role to play in ensuring timely submission of ballistics data to NIBIN. Today, the President is directing all federal law enforcement agencies to issue rigorous requirements regarding NIBIN data submission and use of this tool.\n\nAccelerate and intensify implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). BSCA is the most significant gun safety legislative accomplishment in nearly 30 years, and the Biden-Harris Administration is treating it as such by making the most of every opportunity it provides to reduce gun violence. President Biden is directing each agency responsible for the law’s implementation to send a report to him, within 60 days, on progress toward full implementation of BSCA and additional steps they will take to maximize the benefits of the law, including by increasing public awareness and use of the resources made available by BSCA.\n\nImprove federal support for gun violence survivors, victims and survivors’ families, first responders to gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. When a hurricane overwhelms a community, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations in order to assess and meet community needs. However, when a mass shooting overwhelms a community, no coordinated U.S. government mechanism exists to meet short- and long-term needs, such as mental health care for grief and trauma, financial assistance (for example, when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business is shut down due to a lengthy shooting investigation), and food (for example, when the Buffalo shooting closed down the only grocery store in the neighborhood). The President is directing members of his Cabinet to develop a proposal for how the federal government can better support communities after a mass shooting, and identify what additional resources or authorities the executive branch would need from Congress to implement this proposal.\n\nAdvance congressional efforts to prevent the proliferation of firearms undetectable by metal detectors. In recent years, we’ve seen the rise of technology that allows guns to be made with polymers and other materials that are increasingly capable of avoiding detection by metal detectors. President Biden is directing the Attorney General to help Congress modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, which is currently set to expire in December 2023.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.""}}",87.85714285714286,2

In attempts to build momentum for the vote, Republicans continued to present misleadingly incomplete information in service of the claim that Biden benefited from his family members’ “influence peddling” with foreign businesses and governments.\n\nSo far, Republicans haven’t been able to establish that Biden was involved in his family’s business dealings, that the president directly benefited from those deals or that he ever used his position as vice president to assist the companies.\n\nIn press releases, media interviews and speeches from the floor in the days before the vote, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House oversight committee, and others highlighted three instances of potential wrongdoing that Comer says warrant the expanded powers of a congressional impeachment inquiry to enforce subpoenas. The resolution to proceed to a formal impeachment inquiry — which Republican leaders noted does not equal an impeachment — was passed along party lines, 221 to 212.\n\nComer cited three “direct monthly payments to Joe Biden from Hunter Biden’s business entity” as evidence that Joe Biden profited from a deal Hunter Biden made with a Chinese energy company. But Hunter Biden’s attorney said the payments — which totaled a little over $4,000 — simply reflect Hunter Biden repaying his father, who bought him a truck while Hunter was in the throes of drug and alcohol addiction. That explanation appears to be corroborated by emails obtained from Hunter Biden’s laptop, as reported by the New York Post last year.\n\nComer also referenced a $40,000 payment to Joe Biden from his brother, Jim. Comer called the payment “laundered China money,” but the check was labeled “loan repayment,” and a similar sum was transferred from a Joe Biden-tied account to his brother less than two months prior.\n\nComer also argued that a 2018 email from a bank money laundering investigator, who identified red flags about millions of dollars from a Chinese company transferred to a company controlled by Hunter Biden, lent credence to the oversight committee’s accusations of money laundering.\n\nIn that email, the bank investigator wrote that Hunter Biden’s company, Owasco PC, received large sums from the Chinese company even though Owasco “does not appear to have any services rendered” and had “no current business purpose.” Given news reports about China “targeting children of politicians and purchase of political influence through ‘sweetheart deals'” and other news reports about Hunter’s “extravagant spending on his own interests (drugs, strip clubs, prostitutes, etc.),” the investigator warned it might be prudent for the bank to reevaluate its relationship with Hunter Biden.\n\nNot mentioned by Comer were subsequent emails in the chain — later released by Democrats on the oversight committee — in which more senior money laundering investigators at the bank concluded the payments were “reasonable and consistent with the business profile” and showed no signs of bribery payments.\n\nHunter’s Indictment\n\nThe vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry came six days after the Department of Justice announced on Dec. 7 that a grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against Hunter Biden alleging that he “engaged in a four-year scheme in which he chose not to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019 and to evade the assessment of taxes for tax year 2018 when he filed false returns.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, despite making more than $7 million in income between 2016 and 2020, Hunter Biden “spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.”\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Hunter Biden failed to pay taxes on money made through overseas business deals, he has not been charged with any crime related to engaging in the deals themselves. The indictment also makes no mention of Joe Biden.\n\nIn an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Dec. 10, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said Hunter Biden’s business deals were only possible by Hunter “trading on his father’s name,” which Romney called “ugly and unsavory.” But Romney said he had not seen any evidence yet that Joe Biden, himself, had committed high crimes and misdemeanors — the threshold for impeachment of a president.\n\n“I don’t see any evidence of that at all,” Romney said. “I think before you begin an impeachment inquiry, you ought to have some evidence, some inclination that there’s been wrongdoing. And so far, there’s nothing of that nature that’s been provided.”\n\n“President Biden’s son, Hunter, has obviously been a very unsavory person and has had some extremely damaged personal foibles, including a drug habit and so forth,” Romney said. “That’s not President Biden. And we’re not going to impeach someone because of the sins of their kids.”\n\nIn an interview on Newsmax on Dec. 12, however, Comer said his committee had “connected the dots” to Joe Biden’s “back pocket.” The same day, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said evidence now showed “it is very likely that he [Biden] was involved in and benefited from his family’s corrupt business dealings.”\n\nIn a statement to the press on Dec. 13, Hunter Biden acknowledged that while in the depths of addiction, “I was extremely irresponsible with my finances.”\n\nHowever, he said, “Let me state as clearly as I can, my father was not financially involved in my business.”\n\nPayments from Hunter-Controlled Company to Joe Biden\n\nOn Dec. 4, Comer released subpoenaed bank records that he said showed “direct monthly payments to Joe Biden from Hunter Biden’s business entity.”\n\nThe redacted bank records released by Comer show a $1,380 payment on Sept. 15, 2018, from Owasco to Joe Biden’s personal checking account, the first of three monthly payments of that amount.\n\n“This wasn’t a payment from Hunter Biden’s personal account but an account for his corporation that received payments from China and other shady corners of the world,” Comer said in a video accompanying a press release. “Payments from Hunter’s business entity to Joe Biden are now part of a pattern revealing Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and benefited from his family’s influence peddling schemes.”\n\nComer said Joe Biden and his family “must be held accountable for this blatant corruption.”\n\nHunter Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, responded to Comer’s release of the check with this statement: “There Chairman Comer goes again – reheating what is old as new to try to revive his sham of an investigation. The truth is Hunter’s father helped him when he was struggling financially due to his addiction and could not secure credit to finance a truck. When Hunter was able to, he paid his father back and took over the payments himself.”\n\nLowell’s explanation for Owasco’s payments to Joe Biden comports with reporting from the New York Post in April 2022, based on emails it says it obtained from a hard drive purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden.\n\nCiting an email from Hunter Biden’s personal assistant at the time, the New York Post story said that in 2018 and 2019 — after Joe Biden left office but before he began his run for president — Joe Biden “agreed to cover more than $800,000 in bills racked up by his son — including legal fees tied to the winding down of his controversial overseas business dealings.” The story included a spreadsheet of other Hunter Biden debts assumed by his father, including “payments and insurance for a Porsche, a Ford truck and a boat; tuition for Hunter’s daughters to attend the University of Pennsylvania and the private Sidwell Friends School; and $37,000 a month to his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.”\n\nThe 2019 spreadsheet published by the New York Post included regular $1,380 payments for a “2018 Ford Raptor Truck Payment.” According to notes on the spreadsheet, that was “Payment to JRB from RHB – autopay owasco acct.”\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Joe Biden bought the truck for Hunter in June 2018 from a dealership in Wilmington because, according to a now-retired salesman who did the deal, Hunter’s credit “wasn’t worth spit.”\n\nOn Newsmax on Dec. 5, however, Comer cast doubt on Lowell’s claim that the payments were simply reimbursements for a car loan.\n\n“They think everyone’s ignorant,” Comer said. “They assume that the majority of Americans at the end of the day are going to be financially illiterate. People know that if you make a loan, you receive a loan repayment, you should have a copy of a check that you made the loan to.”\n\n“I mean they’re just not being honest with the American people,” Comer said. “They want to say, ‘Well the president’s son couldn’t qualify for a truck loan’ for what, $40,000, but then China loans him $5 million, Russia loaned him $3.5 million, the list goes on and on. … But they can’t even get a car loan? It makes no sense.”\n\nIn another appearance on Newsmax the day before, Comer said it didn’t matter if payments from Owasco to Joe Biden were reimbursements for car payments.\n\n“You can loan people money,” Comer said. “If they pay you back then you benefited directly from the influence peddling scheme.”\n\nBut even if Hunter Biden got the money to repay his father from a deal with Chinese partners, that doesn’t prove Joe Biden participated in that deal.\n\n$40,000 Payment from Jim to Joe Biden\n\nComer and others have also raised the issue of a $40,000 check to Joe Biden from his brother Jim and Jim’s wife, Sara, that was labeled “loan repayment.” Comer called the payment “laundered China money.”\n\n“We traced the fact that one of these checks that went into Joe Biden’s back pocket was a $40,000 check that came from China that just happened to be part of a $400,000 check to the company that Joe Biden was supposed to be 10% owner of, the ‘Big Guy’, and lo and behold, that 40,000 ended up being 10%,” Comer said on Newsmax on Dec. 12.\n\nArguing for the formal impeachment inquiry on the floor on Dec. 13, Republican Rep. Byron Donalds also cited the $40,000 paid by Jim and Sara Biden to Joe Biden.\n\n“That’s your evidence,” Donalds said. “If you want to talk crime: bribery, co-conspirators to a FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] violation.”\n\nWe wrote in October about that $40,000 payment — as well as another one for $200,000 — from Jim to Joe Biden. “These bank records show that in 2017 and 2018, while President Biden was not in office, he provided two short-term loans to his brother, James, who repaid each loan within two months,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a press release on Oct. 20.\n\nFactCheck.org obtained an Excel spreadsheet of wire transfer records and check images that are consistent with Raskin’s account.\n\nThose records show two wire transfers from Joe Biden to a joint account for James and Sara Biden, one for $40,000 on July 28, 2017, and one for $200,000 on Jan. 12, 2018. The wires came from an “Attorney Trust Account” maintained by Joe Biden’s attorneys at the firm “MONZACK MERSKY MCLAUGHLIN BROWDER.”\n\nA check image from Sept. 3, 2017, shows a $40,000 payment from a joint account for James and Sara Biden to Joe Biden (the check is signed by Sara Biden and is labeled “loan repayment” on the memo line). The payment was deposited into the same account from which the $40,000 wire payment was made 38 days prior.\n\nIn an emailed statement to the Wall Street Journal, James Biden’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said the checks were repayments of short-term loans made by Joe Biden to his brother. “At no time did Jim involve his brother in any of his business relationships,” Fishman said.\n\nAs for Comer’s claim about 10% going to the “big guy,” Comer is referring to an email the oversight committee obtained in which James Gilliar, a business associate of Hunter Biden, discussed the possible equity for the partners in a business deal that involved Hunter Biden and CEFC, a Chinese energy conglomerate, and referenced, “10 held by H for the big guy?”\n\nRegardless of whether Joe Biden is the “big guy,” the final draft agreement setting up the venture made no mention of Joe Biden.\n\n“I would like to clear up any speculation that former Vice President Biden was involved with the 2017 discussions about our potential business structure,” Gilliar told the Wall Street Journal in 2020. “I am unaware of any involvement at anytime of the former vice president. The activity in question never delivered any project revenue.”\n\nConcerns Raised by Bank Investigator\n\nIn a floor speech on Dec. 13 in support of the resolution for a formal impeachment inquiry, Comer said, “One bank investigator was so concerned about Hunter Biden’s financial transactions with the Chinese company that he wanted to re-evaluate the bank’s relationship with him. He noted that his transactions served ‘no current business purpose.'”\n\nThat’s true, but it’s not the whole story.\n\nOn Nov. 29, the House oversight committee released a June 26, 2018, email from a bank money laundering investigator who raised concerns about bank transactions involving Hunter Biden.\n\n“We have been monitoring the subject customer due to the PEP designation and observations on the account activity as well as recent negative news indicate this entity to be high risk,” the investigator wrote in the email.\n\nPEP is an acronym for “Politically Exposed Person,” which LexisNexis Risk Solutions defines as “someone who, through their prominent position or influence, is more susceptible to being involved in bribery or corruption.”\n\nBy way of background, according to the tax indictment, in 2015, while Joe Biden was still serving as vice president, Hunter Biden began meeting with representatives of CEFC about potential infrastructure projects.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 — after Joe Biden had left the White House — the indictment says Hunter Biden formed a joint venture with CEFC called Hudson West III. In August 2017, Northern International Capital, a Chinese company affiliated with CEFC, seeded Hudson West III with a $5 million capital contribution. According to the operating agreement for Hudson West III, Hunter Biden was to be paid a one-time retainer fee of $500,000 plus $100,000 per month.\n\nShortly after execution of the contract, the indictment states, Hudson West III wired $400,000 to Owasco PC, and an additional $165,000 in monthly transfers after that. In total, more than $3.5 million was transferred to Owasco in 2017 and 2018. Hunter Biden, in turn, transferred about $1.4 million to an unnamed business associate (believed to be Joe Biden’s brother Jim).\n\nIt was the payments to Hunter Biden from this venture that the bank investigator raised concerns about. The bank investigator email released by Comer noted that the payments to Owasco “were indicated as management fees and reimbursements.”\n\n“We find it unusual that approximately 58% of the funds were transferred to” Hunter’s firm “in a few months and the frequency of payments appear erratic,” the investigator wrote. “It was also previously indicated that HUDSON WEST III LLC does not currently have any investment projects at this time, which raises further concerns as millions in fees are being paid but does not appear to have any services rendered by Owasco PC.”\n\n“Furthermore, there has been negative news regarding the beneficial owner of Owasco PC, Robert Hunter Biden (son of former U.S. Vice President- Joe Biden) regarding allegations by his ex-wife that there were financial concerns about his extravagant spending on his own interests (drugs, strip clubs, prostitutes, etc.) which may put his family in a deep financial hole,” the investigator wrote.\n\nIn addition, the investigator warned that “recent negative news indicate China targeting children of politicians and purchase of political influence through ‘sweetheart deals.'”\n\nThe investigator concluded, “The activity on the account appears unusual with no current business purpose and also with the recent negative news … may require re-evaluation” of the bank’s “relationship with the customer.”\n\nComer and other Republicans have said the email confirmed the committee’s suspicion that Hunter Biden’s payments from the Chinese firm smelled of money laundering.\n\n“The bank examiner realized that this was a bad deal,” Comer said in an interview on Fox News on Dec. 3. “Not only is this money laundering, and not only is this tax evasion, but this is how China comes in and buys politicians off.”\n\nReferring to the email in an interview on Newsmax on Dec. 13, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett said, “Can you imagine if any American citizen had $30 million flowing through their bank accounts and the banks even said … ‘This is not legit.’ I mean, in their emails, they were basically saying that.”\n\nHowever, the email shared publicly indicates it is the last of four pages. The first three pages were subsequently shared publicly by Democrats on the oversight committee and include more recent responses in the email chain from more senior investigators, who concluded the concerns raised in the email highlighted by Comer were unwarranted. Although the identities of those who wrote the emails were redacted, a source with direct access to the unredacted bank records provided us with their titles.\n\nOne email notes that bank officials corresponded with Mervyn Yan of Hudson West III. He outlined for bank investigators the business operations and business plan, and the projects Hudson West III was working on.\n\nAccording to that email on Aug. 3, 2018, Yan told bank officials, “HW3 is an operating company for the purpose of sourcing large projects, including LNG, shale, solar and port infrastructures in US, hence the carrying cost is very high. Owasco LLC and Coldharbour are members in such pursuit. We have and continue to act on opportunities. Other than regular monthly draws, others are travel and business expenses from time to time. We have negotiated and still in the process of negotiating major port deal in Louisiana and Texas, acquisition of new solar company in California, shale frackers in Pennsylvania.\n\n“To the extent that [t]here are no guarantees incomes derived from any of these negotiations, only time will tell, and subject to further roadshow and capital raising in China and other … markets.\n\n“The typical deals size we are considering is over $500 million and more,” Yan wrote. “It is time consuming and a lot of efforts spent. The expenses are inline with these types of high risk high return venture activities.”\n\nComer also didn’t share another email sent later that day from an anti-money-laundering compliance officer who said he or she had spoken with the bank’s anti-money-laundering senior investigator, who relayed that, “based on her opinion and experience with larger banks, she thinks the activity is reasonable and consistent with the business profile,” and that she “does not see any sign of bribery” as the business activity is “clearly written in operating agreements.” The senior investigator, the email said, had noted that “The political connection makes sense as it involves the energy industry/sector, which is not easy to get into. Nothing unusual with lobby type of activity.”\n\n“Based on her assessment the activity does not appear unusual,” the compliance officer wrote, recommending that the bank “waive and continue monitoring under PEP process.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/sep/18/kevin-mccarthy/largest-share-of-foreign-payments-went-to-biden-as/', 'Headline': 'Largest share of foreign payments went to Biden associates, not kin ...', 'Snippet': 'The bank records show neither evidence that foreign payments went to President Joe Biden nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.

James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Biden family business dealings. The most recent memo, from Aug. 9, said the House Oversight Committee had ""identified over $20 million from foreign sources that benefitted the Biden family and their business associates.""\n\nPolitiFact analyzed this memo, along with two previously released memos.\n\nTogether, the convoluted, sometimes repetitive, maze of financial records largely supports McCarthy’s carefully phrased claim that ""$20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates."" But his word choice as he announced an impeachment inquiry into the president could give the impression that Biden family members, or even Joe Biden himself, received an equal share of the financial gains. That’s not what bank records PolitiFact has reviewed show.\n\nThe lion’s share of the $20 million went to Biden family business associates; about $5 million went to Biden family members. The records show no evidence that any payments went to Joe Biden, who was vice president when some of the payments occurred. The records also do not reveal that Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nMcCarthy did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.\n\nA tale of three memos: Majority of foreign payments went to Biden family ‘associates’\n\nFinancial records made public between March 16 and Aug. 9 show details of an intricate web of about $19.3 million in payments from foreign sources that were directed to the Bidens’ associates and at least three Biden family members.\n\nThe memos that detail these payments don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden took any official actions because of his family’s business dealings.\n\nThe memos show that about $14.4 million in payments were made to ""associates"" of the Biden family or accounts associated with those individuals. These payments went largely to Hunter Biden business partners: Devon Archer, James Gilliar, Vuk Jeremić and John Robinson Walker.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed this talking point, without McCarthy’s careful phrasing. On Sept. 17, former Vice President Mike Pence, who\'s running for the Republican presidential nomination, told Fox News that when Joe Biden was vice president, his ""family accepted some $20 million, which is a hard fact.""\n\nThese payments to associates originated from companies including Burisma, Bladon Enterprises, State Energy HK and, in one instance, from Yelena Baturina, a wealthy Russian whose name has also been spelled ""Elena.""\n\nBaturina wired $3.5 million to a bank account linked to Hunter Biden and Archer, according to the memos. Republicans alleged some of this money went directly to Hunter Biden, but Archer testified the money was for an unrelated real estate transaction and did not go directly to Hunter Biden. Given this information, we counted it as a payment to an associate; we will update if more evidence comes to light.\n\nDevon Archer, Hunter Biden\'s former business partner, arrives on Capitol Hill July 31, 2023, to give closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee. (AP)\n\nAbout $5 million in payments went to Biden family members\n\nFrom 2014 to 2020, Biden family members received about $4.94 million from sources with ties to Ukraine, Romania, China and Kazakhstan. The memos show these payments went to:\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son;\n\nJames Biden, the president’s brother;\n\nHallie Biden, the wife of Joe Biden’s late son Beau, who also had a relationship with Hunter after Beau’s passing;\n\nAnd an unknown account the memo characterized as a ""Biden"" account without explanation.\n\nIn many instances, payments to Biden family members were sent by wire to Robinson Walker LLC, a company owned by an associate of Hunter Biden, before they were sent to Biden family accounts.\n\nBy PolitFact’s count, about 89% of the money Biden family members received in payments — approximately $4.4 million — went to Hunter Biden or his businesses.\n\nOf the $4.4 million, Hunter Biden and companies he was linked to received:\n\n$2.6 million for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nAbout $949,000 that originated from Bladon Enterprises, a company linked to Gabriel Popoviciu, according to the memos. Popoviciu is a Romanian businessman who was convicted in Romania on criminal corruption charges.\n\n$700,000 that originated from State Energy HK Ltd. and CEFC Infrastructure, two Chinese companies.\n\nAnd $142,300 that came from Kazakhstani millionaire Kenes Rakishev\'s Singapore-based company, and was used to buy Hunter Biden a sports car.\n\nA company linked to James Biden received more than $350,000 that originated with State Energy HK. Hallie Biden received two payments totaling $35,000, which the memos said originated from State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nSeveral payments totaling $150,000 went to the unspecified ""Biden"" account. The memos said that money originated with State Energy HK and Bladon Enterprises.\n\nFor more than four years, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family’s financial links to foreign nationals and foreign governments. Shortly after learning they had won a narrow majority in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee announced that investigating the president and his family’s business deals would be a top priority.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Ian Sams said on X, formerly Twitter, that Republicans have ""turned up no evidence of wrongdoing"" after investigating President Biden for nine months.\n\nHunter Biden remains under federal investigation for his taxes. On Sept. 14, he was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm he obtained after lying about his drug use and two counts of making false statements about his illegal drug use on a form when buying the gun.\n\nHunter Biden speaks to guests during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 18, 2022, in Washington. (AP)\n\nWhat is a shell company?\n\nMcCarthy described the payments to Biden associates and family members as having flowed through ""shell companies.""\n\nA shell company is ""a corporate entity set-up that generally has no business operations,"" said David P. Weber, a professor in the accounting and legal studies department at Salisbury University\'s Perdue School of Business. Weber previously served as chief investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission and as special counsel for enforcement with the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nGenerally speaking, Weber said, ""shell companies are entities formed in a jurisdiction that requires minimal documentation over who the beneficial owner is, have no active business operations or employees, and are formed for secrecy or privacy purposes.""\n\nIn the popular understanding, shell companies usually have a negative connotation, often for good reasons, experts say.\n\nSometimes, shell companies can be created for legitimate purposes, experts said. For instance, they can keep income streams separate if they are to be taxed or regulated in separate jurisdictions, said Daniel Shaviro, a taxation professor at New York University Law School. Weber said he’s seen examples in which gay couples have used shell companies to hide the joint ownership of homes in countries where LGBTQ+ couples are persecuted.\n\nMore often, though, a true ""shell company"" is a red flag for financial investigators, experts said.\n\n""Most shell companies are formed for illegitimate purposes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, other illegal activities,"" Weber said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether companies in the Hunter Biden case qualify as shell companies.\n\nIn analyzing the 21 companies cited in a GOP memo that were founded by, in partnership with, or linked to Hunter Biden, the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that ""virtually all of the companies (many of which now are defunct) had legitimate business interests. Others had clearly identified business investments.""\n\nFor instance, the Fact Checker found entities such as separate companies founded by Hunter Biden that handled legal and lobbying work, the latter of which was disclosed as required under federal law. Rosemont Seneca Partners and several offshoots were vehicles for investments Biden and his associates made in technology, energy and entertainment ventures.\n\nA Republican memo described the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development — a Biden family associate’s account, which received $3 million from the Chinese company State Energy HK — as ""a public policy think tank registered in Belgrade and New York.""\n\nTwo entities, Hudson West III and Hudson West IV, had an energy investment deal with CEFC China Energy. Comer has criticized this effort as ""a scheme to try to get China to buy liquefied natural gas,"" which could be viewed as a tacit acknowledgement that the companies were engaged in actual business pursuits rather than serving as shell companies.\n\n""A company that has legitimate business interests or operations is not generally considered a shell company,"" Weber said. ""It would be considered a real, operating business. Active, operating businesses with employees, physical location, or business interests"" would generally not ""fall into the definition of a shell company.""\n\nThis explains the term’s potency: It includes a clear suggestion of shadiness. But Shaviro said that if the companies do have legitimate business interests and investments, then the Republicans’ use of the term ""shell companies"" is ""inaccurate"" and ""contrary to its generally accepted meaning.""\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcCarthy said ""bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shell companies.""\n\nFinancial records released by House Republicans show a little less than $20 million in payments, but $14 million went to associates, while $5 million went to Biden family members, including Hunter.\n\nHowever, McCarthy was citing the $20 million in payments in support of an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden, and the bank records contain neither evidence that foreign payments went to Joe Biden himself, nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not clear that the phrase ""shell companies,"" which connotes illegitimate purposes, accurately describes the corporate entities through which the money flowed. Many of the companies in question appear to have had tangible business and investment purposes, which would not fit the commonly used definition of shell companies.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Republicans have been investigating the Biden family’s business dealings for evidence of wrongdoing or conflicts of interest.\n\nDiscussing their findings with reporters, Republicans appeared to choose their words carefully — saying things like, ""This could be the most corrupt scheme in American politics"" and ""We’re pretty confident that the president was very knowledgeable of what his family was doing"" — that fell short of a smoking gun.\n\nWhat’s confirmed and supported by facts, and what remains unsubstantiated? Here’s what we learned about the continuing investigation.\n\nWhat are the Republicans investigating?\n\nHouse Republicans launched multiple investigations after securing their narrow majority, including one examining the Biden family’s domestic and international business practices.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability says the investigation is meant to provide transparency and, if needed, could lead the committee to recommend new laws. Such changes might include requiring senior elected officials’ family members to publicly disclose foreign transactions. Another could call for quicker review of suspicious bank activity reports if they are linked to family members of a president or vice president. If the committee’s subpoenas face legal challenges, it must show in court that its investigation has legislative goals.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately been investigating Hunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work since 2018. In April, Hunter Biden’s legal team met with Justice Department prosecutors to discuss the criminal investigation and potential charges, including tax evasion and a felony gun charge related to a firearm purchase, NBC News reported.\n\nWhat did the Oversight Committee find?\n\nOn May 10, House Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., told reporters that during Biden’s vice presidency, other Biden family members ""capitalized on Joe Biden’s public office"" and risked U.S. national security. The committee released a 36-page memo outlining its findings.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed four banks and received thousands of records, the memo said. Based on those records, the committee said Biden family members, associates and their companies received more than $10 million in payments from people or companies with foreign ties, during and after Biden’s vice presidency.\n\nA selection of the released bank records show that, from 2015 to 2017, Biden family members received money from a foreign company connected to Gabriel Popoviciu, The New York Times reported. Popoviciu is a Romanian businessman who was convicted in Romania on criminal corruption charges.\n\nHunter Biden’s connection to Popoviciu has been public since before Biden was elected president. Government ethics experts in 2019 expressed concerns that Popoviciu tried to use Hunter Biden years earlier to avoid criminal prosecution — even as then-Vice President Joe Biden urged Romania to crack down on corruption. But no evidence has come to light showing Hunter Biden and Popoviciu’s business relationship violated laws.\n\nThe bank records also provided details about Biden family members’ business transactions with links to China. The transactions and Hunter Biden’s connection to a Chinese energy company, CEFC, have been known for some time. The memo provided new detail, including a copy of a bank transaction from Aug. 4, 2017, when CEFC wired $100,000 to Hunter Biden’s professional corporation.\n\nA poster titled ""China Payments to Bidens"" is visible as House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman Rep. James Comer Jr., R-Ky., arrives for a news conference on their investigation into the Biden family on May 10, 2023. (AP)\n\nIn 2022, a Washington Post investigation into Hunter Biden’s connection with CEFC ""did not find evidence that Joe Biden personally benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC, which took place after he had left the vice presidency and before he announced his intentions to run for the White House in 2020.""\n\nComer on May 14 told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that his office had lost touch with an informant in the investigation who had information into what Comer called ""a quid pro quo with a foreign country in exchange for foreign aid.""\n\nA Comer spokesperson clarified the next day that the missing informant Comer had spoken of did not have information about a foreign bribery scheme but could talk about the ""Biden family’s influence peddling schemes.""\n\nIan Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, told PolitiFact that Comer’s investigation lacks legitimacy.\n\n""He has hidden information from the public to selectively leak and promote his own hand-picked narratives as part of his overall effort to lob personal attacks at the President and his family,"" Sams said.\n\nPreviously, Biden has falsely denied claims that his family members received money from China. A spokesperson said later that he’d been generally rebutting claims that his administration was corrupted by Chinese money, according to a New York Times report.\n\nWhat’s still unproven?\n\nClaims that the Oversight Committee implicated President Biden in a bribery or corruption scandal overstate what is supported by evidence.\n\nWhen Comer was asked whether the committee could prove Biden’s direct involvement in the payments and business dealings, Comer said that he didn’t think anyone would believe that nine members of the Biden family receiving money was coincidental.\n\nBut the May 10 memo did not provide evidence that Biden took any official actions because of his family’s business decisions. None of the payments detailed in the memo were to the president himself. Additionally, the memo did not show that Biden knew about the payments at the time.\n\nDuring the news conference, Comer was asked how he could discount the idea that Hunter Biden might have simply used his father’s name to get money without involvement from President Biden. He replied that it would be ""hard for me to believe"" that Hunter Biden’s charisma alone would convince people to wire millions of dollars to Biden family members.\n\n""We believe that there was a return on the investment,"" Comer said, without citing evidence. He said the committee will continue to look for evidence the president was involved with his family’s business practices. He provided no specific examples of Joe Biden’s policies or decisions the committee believed were influenced by his family’s business practices.\n\nOversight Committee members repeatedly suggested that the existence of numerous Biden family-linked accounts and limited liability companies signaled wrongdoing.\n\nThe memo, however, did not provide evidence that Hunter Biden or other Biden family members violated the law.\n\nSuch payments and business practices could be subject to ethical scrutiny. Experts have told PolitiFact that it’s not uncommon for Chinese businesses with links to the Chinese government, for example, to court prominent Americans or their family members.\n\nComer pointed out that Biden’s family is not the first to face accusations of family members making money off of the family name. He mentioned President Jimmy Carter’s brother Billy Carter, who records showed received a loan of more than $200,000 from Libya before he registered as a foreign agent representing Libya. Comer also mentioned President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s business practices. Wealth funds linked to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar invested hundreds of millions in Kushner’s private equity firm after the Trump presidency, according to reporting by The New York Times. (Comer dropped a House committee investigation into Kushner’s dealings, the Times also reported.)\n\n""This has been a pattern for a long time,"" Comer said.

Republicans also alleged that Hunter Biden used his familial connections to help facilitate a meeting in 2016 between a Serbian running for United Nations Secretary-General and then-national security adviser to the vice president Colin Kahl.\n\nThe foreign payments raise questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities while his father was vice president, but the committee does not suggest any illegality about the payments from foreign sources. The bank records by themselves also do not indicate the purpose of the payments that were made.\n\nThe memo marks Comer’s most direct attempt to substantiate his allegations that Biden family members have enriched themselves off the family name. Comer has suggested that Biden may have been improperly influenced by the financial dealings, particularly by his family’s foreign business partners.\n\nBut the latest report does not show any payments made directly to Joe Biden, either as vice president or after leaving office.\n\nComer has been publicly teasing information for months about the paper trail committee Republicans have uncovered through subpoenas sent to multiple banks and trips to the Treasury Department to review records.\n\nComer and other Republicans on the committee held a press conference Wednesday morning to tout their findings.\n\n“These people didn’t come to Hunter Biden because he understood world politics or that he was experienced in it, or that he understood Chinese businesses. They wanted him for the access his last name gave him,” Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said during the news conference.\n\nOn Wednesday, Comer was asked about specific policy decisions Biden made while president or vice president that may have been directly influenced by these foreign payments. Comer failed to name any and instead pointed to then-vice president Biden traveling around the world and discussing foreign aid in the last year of the Obama administration, and added they think there are decisions Biden made as president that “put China first and America last.” Comer said the committee “will get into more of those later.”\n\nAhead of the memo’s release, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement to CNN, “Congressman Comer has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called ‘investigations’ with legitimacy. He has hidden information from the public to selectively leak and promote his own hand-picked narratives as part of his overall effort to lob personal attacks at the President and his family.”\n\nAbbe Lowell, counsel for Hunter Biden, said in a statement, “Today’s so-called “revelations” are retread, repackaged misstatements of perfectly proper meetings and business by private citizens. Instead of redoing old investigations that found no evidence of wronging by Mr. Biden, Rep. Comer should do the same examination of the many entities of former President Trump and his family members.”\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement to CNN, “Chairman Comer has failed to provide factual evidence to support his wild accusations about the President. He continues to bombard the public with innuendo, misrepresentations, and outright lies, recycling baseless claims from stories that were debunked years ago.”\n\nPayments from a Romanian business associate\n\nBank records cited in the committee’s memo show that within five weeks of then-Vice President Biden’s meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in 2015, a Romanian who Hunter Biden was doing legal consulting for, Gabriel Popoviciu, started sending money to Rob Walker, a business associate of Hunter’s.\n\nWalker received more than $3 million from November 2015 to May 2017 and wired approximately $1 million in various installments to Hunter Biden, his business associate James Gillian, and Hallie Biden, the widow of the president’s oldest son, Beau Biden who died in May 2015. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were romantically involved for a period after Beau’s death.\n\nIt has long been known that Hunter Biden did legal work for Popoviciu, a wealthy Romanian business executive who was convicted in 2016 on corruption charges.\n\nComer’s memo raises questions about why Popoviciu was paying a Biden family business associate directly instead of the law firm where Hunter Biden worked at the time or the other firm Hunter reportedly referred Popoviciu to.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani was also involved with Popoviciu, which Comer’s memo does not mention.\n\nCommittee Republicans obtained the bank records from subpoenas to four different banks.\n\nMeeting with a Biden aide\n\nThe report also alleges that in 2016, Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian politician who was running for UN secretary-general, tried to use his business relationship with Hunter Biden and his associates to get a meeting with Kahl, who was then an aide in Biden’s vice president’s office.\n\nIn a June 2016 email, Jeremic wrote to Hunter Biden and a business associate, Eric Schwerin, asking to “meet with VPOTUS National Security Advisor Colin Kahl” related to the UN secretary-general election.\n\nSchwerin instructed Hunter Biden to “Think about how you want to respond,” according to the report.\n\nIn a July 2016 email, Jeremic followed up via email saying, “[m]y meeting with Colin did not last very long, but didn’t go too bad, I think. What is suboptimal is that OVP seems to be outside the decision-making loop on the UNSG elections issue. Colin promised to get better informed on what’s going on at the moment,” according to the report.\n\nRepublicans said they intend to pursue more communications related to the matter, but concluded it appears that “a Biden administration official met with Jeremic to discuss the UN Secretary General election at the direction of Hunter Biden and/or his business associates.”\n\nKahl did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeremic’s attorneys told the committee in a letter last month he would not cooperate with a request for documents and testimony due to separation of powers issues and because House rules limit subpoenas to people “within the United States.”\n\nPayments from Chinese nationals\n\nThe memo also alleges that two Chinese nationals made payments of $100,000 to Hunter Biden’s professional corporation through a Chinese-backed energy company. Republicans claim that at least one of those individuals had ties to the Communist Party of China. These transactions, as well as Hunter Biden’s relationship with a Chinese-backed energy company once his father left the VP’s office, have long been known.\n\nThe memo alleges that the two Chinese nationals were connected to CEFC, a Chinese energy conglomerate that had a business relationship with Hunter Biden.\n\nCommittee Republicans claim one of the individuals “used CEFC to bribe and corruptly influence foreign officials.”\n\nThe memo includes a copy of a bank transaction showing that on August 4, 2017, CEFC Infrastructure wired $100,000 to Owasco P.C, Hunter Biden’s professional corporation.\n\nThe memo also includes details from the bank records on how money was moved between companies, including a $100,000 payment to one of Hunter Biden’s companies that was then funded by a Chinese based firm tied to CEFC.\n\nComer alleges the transaction “disproves President Biden’s claim that his family received no money from China.”\n\nIn the report, the committee acknowledges there “exist legitimate commercial transactions with China-based entities and individuals.”\n\n“However, the pattern of behavior engaged in by the Bidens and their Chinese counterparties—memorialized in relevant bank records—signals an attempt to layer companies and cloud the source of money,” the committee alleges.\n\nComer has previously revealed that members of Biden’s family received just over $1 million indirectly from State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company.\n\nSenate Republicans in 2020 first detailed how Walker made wire transfers to companies associated with Hunter Biden and president’s brother, James, after receiving a $3 million wire from the Chinese company.\n\nThe latest GOP memo claims Walker also sent some of that money to Hallie Biden and an unknown bank account identified as “Biden.”\n\nCommittee makes its legislative case\n\nCommittee Republicans said they are continuing to trace bank records and have written to additional witnesses involved in certain transactions to request documents as well as interviews.\n\nAccording to the report, Republicans intend to pursue legislative changes – a key step needed to justify their investigation if fights over subpoenas head to court.\n\nThose changes include laws that require additional reporting about the finances of a president or vice president’s family members, public disclosure of foreign transactions involving the family members of senior elected officials and an expedited law enforcement review of any suspicious bank activity reports related to a president or vice president’s immediately family members.\n\nComer left the door open on whether his committee would investigate the foreign business dealings of former President Donald Trump and his family ahead of making any legislative recommendations to address influence peddling. To date however, Comer has not looked into Trump’s financial dealings or pursued an investigation into the classified documents that he had at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“We’re going to look at everything when we get ready to introduce the legislation to ban influence peddling” Comer said. “This has been a pattern for a long time. Republicans and Democrats have both complained about Presidents’ families receiving money.”\n\nOn the foreign business dealings of Trump’s son-in law, Jared Kushner, specifically, Comer said, “I’m not saying whether I agreed with what he did or not, but I actually know what his businesses are.

The evidence Republicans have provided so far, including during the impeachment inquiry, has not proved Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing. House Republicans on Nov. 8 issued subpoenas for Hunter Biden and Joe Biden’s brother, James, as part of the inquiry.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nA $40,000 check to Joe Biden\n\nThe Republicans’ Nov. 1 bank memo outlines a web of transactions that involve a Chinese company, Hunter Biden’s businesses, and Joe Biden’s brother and sister-in-law. The Republicans’ framing is that Biden’s sister-in-law sent Joe Biden money that originated from sources linked to China.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2017, Northern International Capital wired $5 million to an account for Hudson West III LLC, a company Hunter Biden formed with a Chinese business associate that aimed to help CEFC, a Chinese energy company, establish liquefied natural gas contracts in the U.S. That $5 million was the only money in the Hudson West III account then. The memo describes Northern International Capital as “a Chinese company affiliated with CEFC.”\n\nAlso on Aug. 8, 2017, Hunter Biden wired $400,000 from Hudson West III to Owasco P.C., Hunter Biden’s professional corporation. Owasco P.C. already had $100,000 in it from a wire transfer from CEFC Infrastructure, another company linked to China, bringing the account’s balance to $500,832.\n\nOn Aug. 14, 2017, Owasco P.C. transferred $150,000 to an account for Lion Hall Group, a consulting company linked to Joe Biden’s brother James. That account’s balance was $151,965.\n\nSara Biden, James Biden’s wife, withdrew $50,000 from the Lion Hall Group bank account on Aug. 28, 2017. That same day, either Sara or James Biden deposited $50,000 into their personal account. Sara Biden also withdrew $1,000 from the personal account, bringing the balance to $49,047 as of Aug. 28, 2017.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2017, Sara Biden signed a $40,000 personal check to Joe Biden. The check’s memo section said it was for “loan repayment.”\n\nIn summary: In 2017, Biden’s sister-in-law sent Joe Biden money that originated from sources linked to China, according to the Republicans’ memo.\n\nAvailable bank records contain no evidence of wrongdoing by the president, nor do they provide evidence that Joe Biden knew where the $40,000 originated.\n\n“The President, when he was a private citizen, loaned his brother money, and his brother promptly paid him back,” said Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson. Sams said bank records in Republicans’ possession show that the check was repayment for a loan and cited a press release that Oversight Committee Democrats released Oct. 20.\n\nIn it, ranking committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described the transactions as “personal transactions of the President’s family members that have no relevance to any legitimate congressional inquiry.”\n\nPolitiFact reviewed the records for two bank wires, one for $40,000 and one for $200,000, from an account linked to Joe Biden to James Biden. The records were not explicit documentation of outgoing loans.\n\nChecks the Oversight Committee released show that James Biden then appeared to repay his brother in full, without interest, within two months of each alleged loan.\n\nRepublicans also released a $200,000 check Sara and James Biden had written to Joe Biden on March 1, 2018; it also said “loan repayment” on the memo line. But because it was sent the same day Americore Health LLC, a company that manages rural hospitals across the U.S., wired a $200,000 loan to James Biden, Republicans have claimed it proves Joe Biden benefited from his family’s “shady influence peddling of his name.” FactCheck.org covered it here.\n\n“It’s certainly plausible” that the $40,000 check was a loan repayment, said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the House Oversight Committee’s chair. But even if it were, he said, “it still shows how Joe benefited from his family cashing in on his name — with money from China, no less.”\n\nWhat is money laundering?\n\nBy definition, money laundering involves efforts to obscure the source of money that is obtained illegally, according to government agencies, legal sources and experts.\n\n“In order to have money laundering, you have to have a predicate crime — an initial crime that creates illegal profits,” said Ross Delston, an attorney who specializes in anti-money laundering. “People throw the term ‘money laundering’ around a lot.”\n\nA link to China does not mean that money was obtained illegally, Delston said. And unless it’s illegally obtained, it would not be considered money laundering.\n\nThe bank memo Republicans released Nov. 1 included no new information that would prove the money Hunter Biden received from Northern International Capital or CEFC Infrastructure was obtained illegally.\n\nThus far, none of the memos have provided evidence that the money paid to Biden family members and associates was illicitly obtained.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-oversight-republican-report-biden-family-accusations/', 'Headline': 'House GOP panel says members of Biden family got $10 million from ...', 'Snippet': 'The 36-page interim GOP report, released by Oversight Committee chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, accused some Biden family members and associates of using a ""complicated network"" of more ...', 'Full_text': 'After reviewing thousands of records subpoenaed from four banks, the House Oversight Committee said in an interim report that some Biden family members, associates and their companies received more than $10 million from foreign entities, including payments made during and after President Joe Biden\'s vice presidency.

When asked about a direct link to Mr. Biden, Comer said the early phase of the investigation suggested a pattern of behavior.\n\n""I don\'t think anyone in America who\'s watching C-SPAN or any other network covering this would think that it\'s just a coincidence that nine Biden family members have received money for this influence-peddling scheme,"" Comer said.\n\n""We believe that the president has been involved in this from the very beginning, obviously.

We believe there are 12 banks. So right now, you could say that we\'re in the beginning stages of this investigation.""\n\nHouse Republicans insisted their inquiry has several legislative aims behind it: addressing ""deficiencies"" in ethics and disclosure laws, strengthening reporting requirements for senior elected officials\' family members, and evaluating the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee\'s ranking Democrat, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, said in a statement that a former business associate and financial adviser to then-Vice President Biden told Republican and Democratic Oversight Committee staff in March 2023 that ""he was not aware of any involvement by President Biden in the financial conduct of the President\'s relatives\' businesses, much less any transactions into or out of the then-Vice President\'s bank account related to business conducted by any Biden family member.""\n\nAbbe Lowell, an attorney for Hunter Biden suggested, ""Instead of redoing old investigations that found no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden, Rep. Comer should do the same examination of the many entities of former President Trump and his family members.""\n\nAt the same time, there is a federal investigation into Hunter Biden\'s business dealings that began in 2018, led by David Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware. A 2019 federal subpoena obtained by CBS News sought financial and business records pertaining to 15 business entities and Hunter Biden, the president\'s brother James, as well as two business partners dating back to 2014 when Joe Biden was vice president.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter recently confirmed to CBS News that the attorney for the IRS whistleblower who alleges that the Justice Department interfered in and mishandled the Hunter Biden criminal probe met last week with members of Congress on behalf of his client.\n\nThe meeting was described as a proffer session with the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to lay the groundwork for what the whistleblower could tell investigators and how he could do so without running afoul of taxpayer privacy laws.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/05/10/1175205980/james-comer-republican-oversight-biden', 'Headline': 'Comer says the Biden family received millions from foreign contacts - NPR', 'Snippet': 'House Oversight Chairman James Comer said Republicans have bank records that show the Biden family has benefited financially from foreign contacts.

This is in addition to an NBC report that year that probed Hunter Biden\'s overseas dealings.\n\nHouse Republicans also spotlighted payments from Chinese energy company, CEFC China Energy, to another entity that later made payments to Biden family members.\n\nHowever, reports in past years have already documented the failed costly deal between Hunter Biden and CEFC. For example, the Washington Post reported last year that CEFC previously paid Hunter Biden and his uncle $4.8 million during a 14-month period.\n\nNPR\'s Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/121623_factcheck_biden_impeachment/factcheck-gop-misleading-claims-biden-impeachment-investigation/', 'Headline': 'FactCheck: GOP misleading claims in Biden impeachment investigation', 'Snippet': 'House Republicans continued to present misleadingly incomplete information in service of the claim that President Biden benefited from family members’ “influence peddling” with foreign ...', 'Full_text': ''}}",96.25,2

Pfizer was entitled to its claims for payment. Therefore, Ms. Jackson has not stated a claim for false record liability.”\n\nJackson described Judge Truncale’s decision as a “blueprint” on how government contractors can “commit fraud and get away with it. She and her lawyers said they will appeal the dismissal.\n\nJudge: FCA not created to ‘second-guess’ federal policymakers\n\nJudge Truncale said the FCA places the onus on the federal government to determine whether it had been defrauded.\n\nHe quoted another ruling finding that the FCA was not created to “second guess decisions made by those empowered through the democratic process to shape public policy.”\n\n“When the government, at appropriate levels, repeatedly concludes that it has not been defrauded, it is not forgiving a found fraud — rather, it is concluding that there was no fraud at all,” that ruling went on to state.\n\nThis very argument was put forward by Pfizer during the case. As quoted by The Epoch Times, Judge Truncale asked the defense, “So if the FDA gets it wrong, they just get it wrong, and we live with it?”\n\nTo this, Pfizer attorney Carlton Wessel replied, “Exactly.”\n\nJudge Truncale noted that the federal government has been aware of Jackson’s claims “for several years,” but despite this, granted an EUA “multiple times” and “continues to authorize and provide Pfizer’s vaccine at no cost.”\n\nHe also noted that Jackson’s complaint did not “identify any safety risk that was hidden from the FDA.”\n\nA 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded the scope of a legal principle known as “materiality” resulted in a series of federal court decisions in which fraud cases brought under the FCA were dismissed.\n\nAs interpreted by the Supreme Court, if the government continued paying a contractor despite the contractor’s fraudulent activity, the fraud was not considered “material” to the contract.\n\nThe FCA also allows whistleblowers to file claims on the basis of harassment, retaliation and threats if they are engaged in a “protected activity,” defined as being “motivated by a concern regarding fraud against the government.”\n\nIt is this aspect of Jackson’s claim that will be allowed to proceed on appeal.\n\nVentavia hired Jackson in September 2020. She reported problems she observed with the Pfizer vaccine trial to the company’s management that same month. When management didn’t respond, she took her claims to the FDA on Sept. 25, 2020. Ventavia fired her that same day.\n\nJudge Truncale ruled that Jackson had not engaged in protected activity under the standard set by the FCA, but left open the possibility that she could file a retaliation claim under a different statute.\n\nPfizer previously was heavily fined in connection with the FCA. As part of a 2009 settlement, the company paid $2.3 billion in fines — the largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice — stemming from allegations of illegal marketing of off-label products not approved by the FDA.\n\nIn an attempt to strengthen the FCA’s anti-retaliation provisions and install new safeguards against industry-level blacklisting of whistleblowers seeking employment, Congress in July 2021 introduced the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, Pfizer hired a well-connected lobbyist, Hazen Marshall, and the law firm Williams & Jensen to lobby against the bill, which ultimately faltered in Congress.\n\nA new bill, the Administrative False Claims Act of 2023 (S.659), was filed as part of the current Congressional session, sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who also sponsored the 2021 version of the bill.\n\nThis version of the bill passed the Senate via unanimous consent on March 30. It remains pending before the U.S. House of Representatives. However, its provisions are significantly more limited than the 2021 version of the bill, raising “the maximum amount of a fraud claim that may be handled administratively from $150,000 to $1 million.”\n\nBy contrast, the 2021 version of the bill stated:\n\n“In determining materiality, the decision of the Government to forgo a refund or to pay a claim despite actual knowledge of fraud or falsity shall not be considered dispositive if other reasons exist for the decision of the Government with respect to such refund or payment.”\n\nThis language appears to be missing from the 2023 version of the bill.\n\nIt is not known if Judge Truncale issued his decision on March 31 in anticipation of the bill passing the House and potentially becoming law.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://thehighwire.com/editorial/terrified-of-discovery-massive-implications-in-pfizer-whistleblower-case/', 'Headline': 'Terrified of Discovery: Massive Implications in Pfizer Whistleblower ...', 'Snippet': 'Whistleblower Plaintiff Brook Jackson and Defendants Pfizer, Ventavia, and ICON met in Judge Michael J.

Truncale’s Beaumont, Texas, courtroom on March 1, 2023, to hear Pfizer’s motion to dismiss the False Claims Act case Jackson filed against the pharmaceutical giant on behalf of the United States. Depending on Truncale’s ruling, the case could further expose the enormous fraud and deception between Pfizer and the U.S. government as the billionaire company cut corners and wasted taxpayer money to get its experimental COVID-19 gene therapy jabs into the arms of society. While the world awaits Truncale’s ruling on whether the case will move forward with discovery or be dismissed altogether, as Pfizer hopes, Jackson’s attorney Robert Barnes summed up what is undoubtedly the belief held by any American paying attention, tweeting:\n\n“Pfizer promised to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for prevention of COVID based on honest clinical data. Instead, they delivered a dangerous, ineffective gene therapy, preventing nothing. Pfizer lied. People died. Time for discovery.”\n\nJudge Truncale, appointed in 2019, allowed nearly four hours of oral arguments last Wednesday in the case, which centers around revelations of shoddy practices at Ventavia, a contract research company hired to carry out Pfizer’s pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial before the FDA’s issued its Emergency Use Authorization. Truncale noted that he would not issue a ruling from the bench. As of March 6, a decision has yet to be handed down, and according to Barnes, Truncale’s written opinion could take weeks or even months, depending on how long it takes the court to review the case. Barnes explained that the court expressed concern that the net effect of Pfizer’s argument could be “that there’s no role for the judiciary in overseeing what takes place if the FDA simply continues along with the Pfizer fraud.”\n\nTrying to shift responsibility for any wrongdoing, Defense attorneys argued that even if protocol violations occurred, the case should not move forward because the federal government was aware “but still granted emergency authorization to Pfizer’s vaccine.” Racing to beat Moderna as the first pharmaceutical company to unveil an EUA mRNA injection, the billion-dollar company’s attorneys tried to minimize the magnitude of Jackson’s complaints, asserting that “even if rules were violated, the problems only affected a small number of trial sites.” Astounded by Pfizer’s defense, Barnes explained the company’s extraordinary arrogance and untouchable attitude—remember, they have special immunity thanks to the PREP Act—sharing with Owen Shroyer:\n\n“Pfizer’s defense was not that these allegations are false. They challenge whether the allegations are true, but at this stage of the pleadings, they have to assume them to be true legally. Their argument was solely that even if they created a dangerous, ineffective drug that they disguised as a vaccine that they said would be for the prevention of COVID-19, that didn’t prevent COVID at all—in fact, in some cases, it appears the infection rate goes up with COVID depending on how many booster shots that you’ve had—that none of that matters. They argue that as long as the Biden administration, the Justice Department, the FDA, and the Department of Defense go along with this scam, nobody can ever hold them accountable.\n\nThe only way to hold them accountable is the Brook Jackson suit.”\n\nJackson, who has dedicated nearly twenty years to helping get safe and effective therapeutics, vaccines, and devices to consumers, began working for Ventavia on September 8, 2020. Her primary responsibility was overseeing Pfizer’s Phase 3 COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” trial at several locations in Texas. With no reason to initially doubt anything about Pfizer’s drug product or trial, Jackson took her job seriously and was shocked at the poor laboratory management at Ventavia, which calls itself the largest privately owned research company in Texas. Jackson documented several matters of concern, including needles sticking out of bags and vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants. Moreover, with doctored data throughout the trial, participants with severe adverse reactions were ignored, also against protocol. With the agreement for Pfizer to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, Barnes highlighted the clinical trial atrocities, explaining:\n\n“It was supposed to be a randomized test. It wasn’t. It was supposed to be a placebo-controlled test. It wasn’t. It was supposed to be a blinded clinical trial. It wasn’t. All the data was doctored, and the data, in many ways, was fabricated or falsified.”\n\nPointing out Pfizer’s incredibly well-constructed deception, Barnes explained that certifications were fraudulent, invoices were bogus, and Pfizer further argued that it didn’t have to comply with the FDA rules, which is untrue and was rightly pointed out by Judge Truncale in Wednesday’s hearing. According to Barnes, Pfizer’s contract clearly states that it must follow FDA rules and regulations throughout the entire process. And most importantly, as previously noted, the contract Pfizer signed with the DoD states at least “half a dozen times” that Pfizer will deliver “a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.” A task at which the company failed miserably.\n\nWith mounting evidence underlining the extreme measures Pfizer took to deceive the American people as the Biden administration stood by and watched, Barnes hinted that he thinks the next wave of potential litigation against Pfizer and Moderna will be centered around the fact they lied to their shareholders. Barnes pointed out that just as Pfizer and Moderna lied to the Trump Defense Department by stating they would deliver a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, the pharma giants also told their shareholders the same thing. Yet, the vaccine is neither safe nor effective. According to Barnes, that’s fraud on the market, which is one place Pfizer and Moderna have no immunity. Summarizing how perhaps Pfizer is starting to feel the heat, Barnes explained:\n\n“Right now, they’re begging the court not to allow any discovery to occur in this case. They argue that no court process should be allowed and that no jury should be allowed to hear the case. They made this argument explicitly. In fact, what they said is, ‘once the FDA says something, judge, you judge, have no more power to say a single thing about this. You, the jury has no more power to say a single thing about this.’ [Which is] directly contrary to the False Claims Act.\n\nAnd the key is if this fraud is exposed, that opens the door for them to be held accountable across the board.”\n\n148,859 total views, 35 views today'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://citizenwells.substack.com/p/brook-jackson-whistleblower-lawsuit', 'Headline': 'Brook Jackson whistleblower lawsuit allegations against Ventavia Pfizer ...', 'Snippet': 'A lawsuit filed by whistleblower Brook Jackson alleging Pfizer and two of its contractors manipulated data and committed other acts of fraud during Pfizer’s COVID-19 clinical trials is paused following a motion by the defendants to dismiss the case..

Pfizer delegated management of the clinical trial to subcontractor Defendant Icon PLC (“Icon”), an Irish clinical research organization. Icon was tasked with oversight of over 160 test sites worldwide, ensuring trial protocol compliance, and ensuring reporting of required information. This includes oversight of Serious Adverse Event (“SAE”) reporting, which is required by the trial protocol and federal regulations. Pfizer remained responsible for managing and quality checking all data for the entire clinical trial, per the trial’s protocol.\n\n5. Defendant Ventavia Research Group, LLC (“Ventavia”) was contracted by Pfizer to provide three Phase 3 test sites for the vaccine trial in Houston, Fort Worth, and Keller, Texas. Ventavia ultimately enrolled about 1,500 clinical trial patients. Ventavia employed Relator Jackson as a Regional Director. She was tasked with overseeing site management, patient enrollment, quality assurance completion, event reporting, corrective action plan creation, communication with management, and staff training completion at the Keller and Fort Worth sites.\n\n6. Pfizer, aiming for the title of “first successful COVID-19 vaccine,” pushed Ventavia to enroll as many patients as possible in the vaccine trial as quickly as possible. Ventavia was compensated by Pfizer mainly on a per-patient basis—up to a weekly limit—and rushed to enroll as many clinical trial participants as possible per week. Ventavia’s race to maximize payment and over-booking of patients resulted in sloppy and fraudulent documentation practices, poor clinical trial protocol compliance, and little oversight. Pfizer and Icon turned a blind eye to Ventavia’s misconduct, despite numerous warning signs.\n\n7. Ventavia’s trial protocol and regulatory violations were so widespread, in fact, that Relator observed them on a near-daily basis during her brief employment period. For example,\n\nRelator observed:\n\n• fabrication and falsification of blood draw information, vital signs, signatures and other essential clinical trial data;\n\n• enrollment and injection of ineligible clinical trial participants, including Ventavia employees’ family members;\n\n• failure to timely remove ineligible patients’ data from the trial;\n\n• failure to maintain temperature control for the vaccine at issue;\n\n• failure to monitor patients after injection as required by the trial protocol;\n\n• principal investigator oversight failures;\n\n• use of unqualified and untrained personnel as vaccinators and laboratory personnel;\n\n• failure to maintain the “blind” as required, which is essential to the credibility and validity of the observer-blinded clinical trial;\n\n• ethical violations, such as failure to secure informed consent and giving patients unapproved compensation;\n\n• improper injection of the vaccine (i.e., by over-diluting vaccine concentrate or using the wrong needle size);\n\n• failure to ensure that trial site staff were properly trained as required by good clinical practices;\n\n• safety and confidentiality issues, including HIPAA violations; and\n\n• other violations of the clinical trial protocol, FDA regulations, and Federal Acquisition Regulations and their DoD supplements.\n\n8.

If successful, their clients would avoid depositions under oath.\n\nDefense attorneys told the judge Wednesday that whether protocol violations occurred was ultimately irrelevant because the federal government was made aware of them but still granted emergency authorization to Pfizer’s vaccine.\n\nThey pointed out that the federal government backed the defendant’s motions, asserting that even if rules were violated, the problems only affected a small number of trial sites.\n\nLawyers for Brook Jackson, the whistleblower, countered by saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the vaccine before reviewing the information Jackson provided.\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Truncale, the Trump appointee overseeing the case, said he would not issue a ruling from the bench, and a decision has not been handed down as of March 2.\n\nTruncale said he did not usually allow oral arguments on motions to dismiss but felt it was necessary for due process in a case that had captured the public’s attention.\n\nViolations\n\nVentavia ran some of the sites for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Phase 3 clinical trial. The company didn’t properly report adverse events and failed to keep all participants blinded, according to internal communications revealed by Jackson.\n\nVentavia and other companies were hired by the clinical research company ICON, which Pfizer hired to oversee trial sites.\n\nJackson was hired by Ventavia in September 2020. She worked on clinical trials for 18 years and has been described as an expert. She was fired the same day she alerted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of trial irregularities, 18 days after starting the new job.\n\nJackson sued Ventavia, Pfizer, and ICON in 2021 for violating the False Claims Act, a law that prohibits knowingly making a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval from the government. She also accused Ventavia of illegal retaliation.\n\nBefore the hearing, Jackson told The Epoch Times that she would appeal the case if the judge dismissed it because the public deserves the truth—that the vaccines are not safe or effective because the data was manipulated.\n\n“I did this on behalf of the American people,” she said.\n\nThe companies have said that Jackson has not proven violations occurred partly because of how the contract between Pfizer and the government was structured.\n\nFDA Decision\n\nTruncale questioned attorneys for both sides during oral presentations.\n\nThe judge asked whether the FDA’s decision not to pursue the issue impacted the claim’s validity.\n\nHe said there could be many reasons why the FDA may have decided not to get involved, including “political” ones.\n\n“So if the FDA gets it wrong, they just get it wrong and we live with it?” Truncale asked.\n\n“Exactly,” said Pfizer attorney Carlton Wessel, adding that if the government doesn’t think it’s been defrauded, that should end the case.\n\nThe judge posed a hypothetical situation as to whether the court could act in cases where the government may hide things or cover them up.\n\n“There’s no big conspiracy here,” Wessel said. “The vaccine is not a political thing.”\n\nWessel said the government continued to purchase the vaccine and expressed “full confidence in the data.” He said that the experts in the government should make the decisions on the vaccine, not Jackson.\n\nBut Robert Barnes, one of Jackson’s attorneys, said that just because the government was still paying for the vaccine didn’t mean there wasn’t a problem.\n\n“The government under that contract has no right to withhold payment,” added Warner Mendenhall, another attorney for Jackson.\n\nThe FDA says the vaccine is safe and effective, Barnes told the judge, but now the whole world “knows the consequences.”\n\nMendenhall argued that the case warrants further investigation through discovery.\n\nHe refuted that the FDA knew the gist of Jackson’s complaint before issuing vaccine authorization. Evidence indicates the FDA authorized the vaccine before reviewing the information she provided, he said.\n\nMendenhall claims there were concerns about fraudulent data from some within the FDA.\n\n‘Interest of the People’\n\nThe case was unsealed in 2022 after the U.S. government declined to back Jackson. It has instead filed in support of the motions to dismiss.\n\nMendenhall said Jackson reported that signatures on consent forms weren’t obtained until after the placebo or trial vaccine was administered, temperature controls weren’t maintained, and patients weren’t monitored.\n\nHe said the public deserves to know what happened with the vaccine trials.\n\n“That’s the interest that matters here—the interest of the people,” Mendenhall said.\n\nAfter the hearing, Jackson said she believes her case is important to those who have been injured by the vaccine and hopes that any funds recovered through the litigation will go into a fund to help them. She added that she felt the judge was aware of the case’s significance.\n\n“I felt like he was very thorough, and he understood this is an important case,” Jackson told The Epoch Times.\n\nDiscovery\n\nJackson hopes the case will move forward, allowing her lawyers to depose principal investigators at each clinical trial site and even Dr. Anthony Fauci if possible. Fauci, the former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director, widely promoted the COVID-19 vaccines as safe and effective.\n\nAlthough critics have called her an anti-vaccinationist, Jackson noted she had worked on clinical trials for almost two decades.\n\n“I love my country. I’m anti-corruption,” she said. “It’s all about the vaccine-injured for me and taking down pharma.”\n\nMendenhall said before the hearing that Jackson’s team looked forward to getting materials through discovery if the case was allowed to move forward.\n\n“We get Pfizer’s internal documents, and we can really dig into what happened to these 44,000 trial participants that they had,” Mendenhall told NTD.\n\nMendenhall believes the materials would show that “many other trial sites were actually being run in a manner that is not appropriate for getting good data.”\n\n“And if they don’t have good data, then that emergency use authorization is then pulled back by the FDA,” Mendenhall said. “They don’t have enough data to support it, and if that happens, this whole thing is over. The mandates are over; the shot is over,” he added.\n\nVentavia has accused Jackson of entering the company with “an agenda,” noting that she recorded conversations with employees and went into certain areas it suggested she should not have.\n\nJackson said she was compelled to document what she encountered, including patient information being left out in the open, hazardous material being stored improperly, and other violations.\n\n“I was the first one there, and I was the last one to leave from pretty much day one,” Jackson said. “Just really trying to get a handle on the chaos is the only way that I can describe it.”\n\nDarlene McCormick Sanchez contributed to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/pfizer-lied-people-died-whistleblower-case-update--legal-panel/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer Lied, People Died: Whistleblower Case Update + Legal Panel', 'Snippet': 'Second Amended Complaint Filing v Pfizer.

The government’s lawyers didn’t explain why they did not intervene and the FDA, which is supposed to investigate alleged clinical trial fraud, hasn’t responded.\n\nBrook Jackson filed a lawsuit in January 2021 under the False Claims Act accusing Pfizer and two of its contractors, Ventavia Research Group and ICON PLC, of “cutting corners in clinical trials” and falsifying clinical trial documents in their “race to secure billions in federal funding and become the first to market.”\n\nJackson alleged that as a result, millions of Americans received “a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented.”\n\nJackson was a regional director for Ventavia in 2020 before being fired after she filed a complaint with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over indiscretions she said she observed during Pfizer’s vaccine trials.\n\nEvidence of fraud and misconduct shared with BMJ\n\nAlthough the original complaint was sealed, Jackson gave the British Medical Journal (BMJ) a cache of internal company documents, photos and recordings highlighting Ventavia’s misconduct in November 2021.\n\nJackson told the BMJ Ventavia falsified data, unblinded patients, cut corners, improperly diluted the vaccines, employed inadequately trained people to administer vaccines, did not provide informed consent, deviated from the recommended temperature — which is crucial for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer’s — and was slow to follow up on and/or did not report adverse events that occurred during the crucial phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nIn a recording of a meeting on Sep. 2020 shared with the BMJ by Jackson, a Ventavia executive explained the company wasn’t able to quantify the types and number of errors they were finding when examining the trial paperwork for quality control.\n\n“In my mind, it’s something new every day,” a Ventavia executive says. “We know that it’s significant.”\n\nIn an email sent by ICON, it was revealed Venavia was not keeping up with data entry inquiries. In September 2020, ICON sent Ventavia an email stating the expectation of the study is that all queries be addressed within 24 hours.\n\nICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding queries older than three days, including two from individuals for which the subject had “reported with severe symptoms/reactions.”\n\nIn keeping with protocol, “subjects experiencing Grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. Please confirm if an UNPLANNED CONTACT was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate,” the email states.\n\nAccording to the trial protocol, the participant should have been contacted via phone “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”\n\nJournalist Matt Taibbi, a journalist, said he listened to a recording where a Ventavia employee referred to its trial data problems as “cleanup on aisle five” and grilled Jackson about whether she had “spilled the beans” to outsiders.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook censored the BMJ report and warned users not to share it because “Lead Stories,” Facebook’s questionable fact-checker, claimed the reporting would not “disqualify” the overall Pfizer COVID vaccine trial.\n\nDocuments show problems had been going on for weeks. In a list of “action items” sent among Ventavia leaders in early August 2020 — shortly after the trial began and before Jackson’s hiring — a Ventavia executive specified three site staff members with whom to “go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc.”\n\nOne of them was “verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry,” a document indicates.\n\nAt numerous times during the September meeting, Jackson and Ventavia executives talked about the chance the FDA could show up for an inspection. “We’re going to get some kind of letter of information at least, when the FDA gets here . . . know it,” an executive stated.\n\nJackson fired for reporting concerns to FDA\n\nAccording to the complaint, after repeatedly notifying Ventavia of the problems she witnessed, Jackson called the FDA’s hotline to report trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns.\n\nJackson said she received an acknowledgment email from the agency and a follow-up phone call from an FDA inspector, but no further communication. She was fired hours later. Pfizer responded by “expanding its trial to include even more participants.”\n\nJackson then filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division, under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe main allegations against Pfizer and Venavia include making or using false records or statements to cause claims to be paid, presenting false and/or fraudulent claims, making or using false records or statements material to false and/or fraudulent claims and retaliation.\n\nThe complaint remained under seal until Feb. 10, when Judge Michael Truncale ordered it unsealed after the U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene.\n\nAlthough Jackson only witnessed wrongdoing in Texas, “Pfizer and Icon’s oversight failures and fraudulent misconduct vis-a-vis Ventavia bring the entire Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial into question,” she claims.\n\nThe exhibits posted on Jackson’s website, show the FDA was aware of problems with Pfizer’s vaccine trials last year, yet claim to have “full confidence” in the data used to support emergency use authorization of company’s vaccine and full approval of its vaccine Comirnaty — which is not even available in the U.S.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.brown-watch.com/brownwatch-news/2022/3/2/judge-unseals-400-pages-of-evidence-clears-way-for-pfizer-whistleblower-lawsuit', 'Headline': 'Court Unseals 400 Pages of Evidence, Clears Way for Whistleblower ...', 'Snippet': 'From [] A whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraud during Pfizer’s COVID vaccine trials is moving forward, after a district court judge unsealed the complaint, including 400 pages of exhibits.Brook Jackson in January 2021 sued Pfizer and two companies the drugmaker contracted with to work on the trials: Ventavia Research Group and ICON PLC..

The lawsuit includes several charges of fraud and retaliation on the part of both Ventavia and Pfizer.\n\nThe complaint remained under seal until Feb. 10, when U.S. District Court Judge Michael Truncale ordered it unsealed.\n\nPfizer ‘deliberately withheld crucial information’ about vaccine’s safety\n\nAccording to Jackson’s lawsuit, Pfizer, Ventavia and ICON “deliberately withheld crucial information from the United States that calls the safety and efficacy of their vaccine into question.”\n\nThe lawsuit states:\n\n“Defendants concealed violations of both their clinical trial protocol and federal regulations, including falsification of clinical trial documents.\n\n“Due to [the] Defendants’ scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented.”\n\nThe core allegations of Jackson’s lawsuit include claims against Ventavia and Pfizer of:\n\nMaking or using false records or statements to cause claims to be paid.\n\nPresentation of false and/or fraudulent claims.\n\nMaking or using false records or statements material to false and/or fraudulent claims.\n\nRetaliation.\n\nFor instance, Jackson alleges:\n\n“From 2020 to the present, Defendants [Ventavia and Pfizer] knowingly made, used, or caused to be made or used, false records or statements that were material to false and/or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the United States [Department of Defense, or DoD]. These false records or statements include the clinical trial protocol Pfizer submitted to the United States and the falsified source documents and data behind Defendants’ trial results and EUA application.\n\n“By creating and carrying out their fraudulent schemes, Defendants knowingly and repeatedly violated … the False Claims Act. Defendants’ false records were material to Pfizer’s claims for payment for the vaccine at issue. The United States DoD would not have paid Pfizer if it knew that the clinical trial protocol was not complied with by Defendants, because the protocol violations call the integrity and validity of both the entire clinical trial and Pfizer’s EUA into question.\n\n“Defendants’ false records also went to the very essence of the bargain the United States contracted for. DoD contracted to purchase vaccines found effective by a valid clinical trial conducted according to the protocol submitted by Pfizer. The integrity of the entire clinical trial was compromised by the trial protocol violations, false source documents, and the false data that resulted, which calls the vaccine’s EUA into question. Had the United States DoD known of Defendants’ false records, it would not have paid Pfizer.\n\n“Defendants’ use, or causation of use, of material false records was a foreseeable factor in the United States DoD’s loss and a consequence of Defendants’ schemes. By virtue of Defendants’ actions, the United States DoD has suffered actual damages and is entitled to recover treble damages plus a civil monetary penalty for each false and/or fraudulent claim.”\n\nJackson is requesting damages, including back pay, in addition to reinstatement of her position with Ventavia.\n\nVentavia, which describes itself as the largest privately owned clinical research company in Texas, operated several sites where clinical trials were taking place on behalf of Pfizer.\n\nJackson, a regional director for Ventavia, was hired by the company when Pfizer contracted with it to conduct its phase 3 vaccine trial.\n\nJackson, who possessed over 15 years’ worth of experience working with clinical trials, “repeatedly informed her superiors of poor laboratory management, patient safety concerns and data integrity issues” during the approximately two weeks she was employed by Ventavia.\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2020, Jackson emailed the FDA, listing a dozen concerns she said she had witnessed. These included:\n\nLack of timely follow-up for patients who experienced adverse events from the trial.\n\nProtocol deviations that went unreported.\n\nRetaliation against and targeting of Ventavia employees who reported such problems.\n\nTrial participants being placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff.\n\nVaccines not being stored at proper temperatures.\n\nWrongly labeled laboratory specimens.\n\nJackson provided documents indicating falsified data, blind trial failures and awareness on the part of at least one Ventavia executive that members of the company’s staff were “falsifying data.”\n\nJackson’s documents also provided evidence of administrators who had “no training” or medical certifications, or who provided “very little oversight” during the trials.\n\nSeveral internal company emails would be copied to a Pfizer official, who would respond to some of the correspondence.\n\nThe documentation provided by Jackson also demonstrated that she had discussed with Ventavia executives the possibility of the FDA conducting an unannounced inspection. The executives were described as “dreading” such a possibility.\n\nAccording to Jackson, she received an acknowledgment email from the FDA and a follow-up phone call from an FDA inspector, but no further communication.\n\nVentavia fired her within hours of her contacting the FDA.\n\nVentavia executive on Pfizer vaccine trial: ‘cleanup on aisle five’\n\nAs reported by investigative journalist Matt Taibbi, a recording of a Ventavia executive revealedthe individual in question referred to the problems with the vaccine trial as “cleanup on aisle five” and that this same executive pressed Jackson as to whether she had revealed information to outsiders.\n\nThis led Jackson to contact The BMJ, which in November 2021 published an article based on the evidence she had provided highlighting Ventavia’s repeated failures.\n\nJournalist Paul Thacker, who had previously investigated financial ties between “Big Pharma” and physicians for the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, wrote The BMJ article.\n\nIn November 2020, Ventavia appeared to have confirmed its knowledge of problems that occurred with the vaccine trial, and claimed that it would conduct an investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Pfizer continued its relationship with Ventavia, hiring it as a research subcontractor for at least four other trials, including trialing the COVID vaccine for children, young adults, pregnant women and the safety of a booster dose.\n\nThe FDA, despite knowledge of the allegations against Pfizer and Ventavia, went ahead and granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, including for children 5 to 11 years old.\n\nThe FDA in August 2021 stated that it inspected only nine of the trial’s 153 sites. None of Ventavia’s sites were included. (A 2007 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found the FDA inspected only 1% of clinical trial sites).\n\nVentavia went on the offensive against Jackson, claiming that:\n\n“Ms. Jackson worked for us for only 18 days and, as a result, did not complete the requisite training for the role for which she was hired. We are confident in our practices and procedures in conducting clinical trials, and, should her case move forward, we will respond to the litigation accordingly.”\n\nVentavia later, in a Feb. 11 statement, modified its claims about Jackson, writing:\n\n“Although Jackson was hired to oversee certain sites and aspects of clinical trials, she was only employed with Ventavia for 18 days, and, as a result, did not have the longevity with the company to complete the training for the role for which she was hired.”\n\nHowever, according to Thacker, “[s]everal documents show that Jackson worked on Pfizer’s clinical trial.” These documents include a clinical trial delegation log which lists Jackson as a participant.\n\nAlso, according to Thacker, dozens of media organizations also failed to issue retractions of their reports which alleged Jackson had no direct involvement with the vaccine trials.\n\nJackson threatened to file a separate defamation lawsuit against Ventavia over its characterization of her employment.\n\nThe BMJ, in turn, was targeted for publishing the report. Facebook throttled the report and issued warnings to its users not to share it, following a report by one of the company’s contracted “fact checkers,” Lead Stories, claiming the report would not “disqualify” the overall trial of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nLead Stories went so far as to describe The BMJ as a “blog.”\n\nThe BMJ said that it is “considering all available options” in terms of a potential legal claim against Facebook, which recently admitted in a court of law that its “fact checks” are “pure opinion.”\n\nFeds won’t intervene in whistleblower case … for now\n\nThe documents pertaining to Jackson’s lawsuit were released after U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys declined to intervene on her behalf in the case.\n\nThe DOJ filed a “notice of election to decline intervention,” asking the court to get “written consent” in the event the parties to the lawsuit wish to dismiss or settle the case.\n\nThe government also reserved the right to intervene at a later date.\n\nNeither the DOJ lawyers nor the FDA offered an explanation for why the DOJ chose not to intervene.\n\nJackson said that she was not surprised the federal government opted not to intervene, but expressed her “total disappointment,” adding that “[w]e’re going to pursue the case without the help of the government.”\n\nWhile Jackson has stated her belief that the likelihood of her case succeeding is low, she also saidthat “[i]t’s just a chance I have to take. I just feel like somebody has to be held accountable.”\n\nVentavia also remarked upon the government’s refusal to intervene. Lauren Foreman, the company’s director of business development and communications, wrote in an email to Just the News, “[w]e are gratified the government has declined the case.”\n\nBUY TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci'\n\nJackson apparently lost her original Texas-based lawyers in October 2021, but was able to attain new legal representation in December 2021, headed by Los Angeles-based attorney Robert Barnes.\n\nThe federal government’s refusal to intervene comes in contrast to the FDA welcoming Pfizer’s offer to intervene in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit filed against the agency.. A federal judge ruled Pfizer must disclose redacted versions of nearly 400,000 pages of documents pertaining to its issuance of an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThe FDA claimed it could not release the documents at a fast enough rate to meet the demands of the court or the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nPfizer then asked the court to intervene, ostensibly to “help” the FDA with the process of releasing the documents.\n\nA federal court rejected Pfizer’s bid to intervene.\n\nPfizer lobbies to limit False Claims Act\n\nJackson’s primary lawsuit against Pfizer, Ventavia and ICON pertains to the False Claims Act — a piece of legislation dating back to the Civil War which rewards whistleblowers who file anti-fraud lawsuits against contractors on behalf of the government.\n\nThe law, originally enacted in response to defense contractor fraud during the Civil War, has to date returned $67 billion to the U.S. government.\n\nWhile the False Claims Act has been in place since the Civil War, it was significantly eroded by a 2016 Supreme Court decision, Universal Health Services v. United States, which found a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act could be dismissed if the contractor in question continued to be paid by the government.\n\nThis resulted in a series of federal court decisions in which fraud cases were dismissed, while the DOJ, via its 2018 Granston Memo, instructed government attorneys to reject more False Claims Act lawsuits.\n\nIn the two years that followed, dismissals of False Claims Act cases indeed increased.\n\nThe decision significantly expanded the scope of a legal principle known as “materiality.” As interpreted by the court, if the government continued paying a contractor despite the contractor’s fraudulent activity, then the fraud was not considered “material” to the contract.\n\nThe issue of materiality is a core component of Jackson’s lawsuit against Ventavia, Pfizer and ICON.\n\nProposed legislation, the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021, which was introduced in Congress in July 2021, would again bolster the law, strengthening the original law’s anti-retaliation provisions by installing new safeguards against industry-level blacklisting of whistleblowers seeking employment.\n\nThe proposed act also would adjust the materiality standard to include instances where government payments have continued despite knowledge of fraud.\n\nThis could affect Pfizer, which has contracts with the U.S. government to provide COVID vaccines.\n\nThe bill passed through committee by a 15-7 vote and was added to the Senate’s legislative calendar on Nov. 16, 2021. However, no action has been taken since.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, Pfizer hired a well-connected lobbyist, Hazen Marshall, and the law firm Williams & Jensen to lobby against the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021, as previously reported by The Defender.\n\nNotably, under the terms of a 2009 settlement, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in fines — the largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) — in a False Claims Act case stemming from allegations of illegal marketing of off-label products not approved by the FDA.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://yated.com/judge-clears-way-for-pfizer-whistleblower-lawsuit/', 'Headline': 'Judge Clears Way for Pfizer Whistleblower Lawsuit - Yated.com', 'Snippet': 'A whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraud during Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine trials is moving forward, after a district court judge unsealed court papers, including 400 pages of evidence.

The company agreed to pay a record $2.3 billion to settle allegations it improperly marketed Bextra and 12 other medicines,” reported Reuters.\n\nAccording to court filings, the pharmaceutical company provided doctors with travel arrangements to luxurious resorts to improperly promote the drug, and made misleading claims about the drug’s safety and efficacy, the government said.\n\nThe drug was later pulled from the shelves over concerns that it heightened the risk of heart attacks and strokes, the Reuters article said.\n\nIn addition to Bextra, the company fraudulently marketed “Geodon, an anti-psychotic drug; Zyvox, an antibiotic; and Lyrica, an anti-epileptic drug. The settlement also resolves allegations that Pfizer paid kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to prescribe these, as well as other drugs,” a Department of Justice press release stated.\n\nRepeat Offender\n\n“The world’s biggest drugmaker was slapped with the huge fines by the U.S. government after being deemed a repeat offender in pitching drugs to patients and doctors for unapproved uses,” the Reuters article said.\n\n“This historic settlement will return nearly $1 billion to Medicare, Medicaid, and other government insurance programs,” a government spokeswoman said. “Illegal conduct and fraud by pharmaceutical companies puts the public health at risk, corrupts medical decisions by health care providers, and costs the government billions of dollars.” Just three years later, in Aug. 2012, Pfizer agreed to pay the federal government $60 million to settle allegations that its employees bribed doctors, hospital administrators and regulators in Europe and Asia to win business and boost sales. The Securities and Exchange Commission attested that Pfizer’s overseas subsidiaries—located in 180 countries—made illegal payments to health care officials in China, Italy, Russia, Croatia and other Eastern European countries.\n\n“As early as 2001, Pfizer sales representatives tried to conceal the bribes by recording them as legitimate business expenses for travel, entertainment and marketing purposes,” the agency said.\n\nAlso in 2012, nearly 10,000 lawsuits filed against Pfizer by women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer after taking Prempro, a synthetic form of estrogen, were settled for $1 billion. The drug is still on the market.\n\nMost recently, Pfizer faced about 3,000 “Chantix lawsuits” filed by people who claimed they experienced suicidal thoughts and psychiatric disorders after using Chantix for smoking cessation. The drug was also found to contain dangerously high amounts of varenicline, a carcinogenic. Chantix has since been recalled; in 2014, Pfizer was obligated to set aside about $288 million for liability payments.\n\nIn some of the above instances, the company pled guilty to the criminal or civil charges. In other cases, the pharmaceutical giant managed to negotiate settlements in the millions and billions of dollars without actually admitting the charges.\n\nAllegations Of Falsified Data in Covid Vaccine Trials\n\nPfizer is currently being sued in federal court by a whistleblower alleging serious issues with its Covid vaccine safety trials. These include claims of ‘falsified data’ in the weeks leading up to Pfizer’s 2020 rollout of its vaccine, after it won an FDA-awarded “emergency use authorization” (EUA).\n\nThe lawsuit filed by whistleblower Brook Jackson, a trained research auditor, was based on serious lapses of protocol she claimed she observed in her role as regional director of the Ventavia Research Group. This agency and another organization called ICON ran Covid vaccine trial tests for Pfizer at several testing sites in Texas, where 1000 participants were enrolled.\n\nAs regional director, Jackson oversaw the drug trials in two of Ventavia’s testing sites, in Fort Worth and Keller. Jackson charged in court filings that the company falsified data, “unblinded” patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial.\n\n[In “double-blinded” trials, neither participants nor staff are aware of who receives the trial drug and who gets the placebo. This is considered vital to a clinical trial that meets the “gold standard.” To “unblind” the participants is viewed as compromising or even disqualifying the trial.]\n\nJackson filed the complaint in Jan 2021, in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, under the False Claims Act. This legislation, which dates back to the Civil War era, rewards whistleblowers who file anti-fraud lawsuits against contractors on behalf of the government.\n\nThe law, originally enacted in response to defense contractor fraud during the Civil War, has returned about $67 billion to the U.S. government.\n\nJackson’s lawsuit includes several charges of fraud and retaliation on the part of both Ventavia and Pfizer. The complaint remained under seal until March, when U.S. District Court Judge Michael Truncale ordered it released and allowed the case to move ahead.\n\nPfizer ‘Deliberately Withheld Crucial Information’ About Vaccine Safety\n\nAccording to Jackson’s complaint, Pfizer, Ventavia and ICON “deliberately withheld crucial information from the United States that calls the safety and efficacy of their vaccine into question.” The lawsuit states that “Defendants concealed violations of both their clinical trial protocol and federal regulations, including falsification of clinical trial documents.”\n\n“Due to [the] Defendants’ scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented,” the complaint said.\n\nCore allegations of Jackson’s lawsuit include claims that Ventavia and Pfizer “used false records or statements” as a basis for Pfizer’s financial claims to Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies that contracted for millions of vaccine doses.\n\n“The integrity of the entire clinical trial was compromised by the trial protocol violations, false source documents, and the false data that resulted, which calls the vaccine’s EUA into question. Had the United States DoD known of Defendants’ false records, it would not have paid Pfizer,” the lawsuit said.\n\nPrior to filing the lawsuit, Jackson said she had repeatedly informed her superiors of substandard laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues.\n\nShe also brought to their attention the company’s poor record-keeping, the unblinding of trial volunteers and staff and the hiring of unqualified personnel. Most seriously, she noted the “improperly diluting” of the vaccine, and the failure to keep the vaccines at recommended temperature,” which is crucial for mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer’s.\n\nWhile Jackson witnessed misconduct only in Texas where she was employed, “Pfizer and Icon’s oversight failures and fraudulent misconduct by Ventavia bring the entire Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial into question,” her lawsuit argues.\n\nPhotographs and Audio Recordings Expose Violations\n\nFrustrated that no corrective actions were being taken to address the issues she brought to the management’s attention, Jackson began to document the failures and breaches of Pfizer’s protocol at Ventavia. Her evidence encompassed audio recordings, company emails and photographs.\n\nOne photo, provided to BMJ journalist Paul Thacker who wrote an expose on the case in November 2021, showed used vaccine needles haphazardly discarded. Another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers printed on the containers and left out in the open, which “unblinded” the participants to personnel.\n\nShortly after taking photographs of improper clinical practices, Jackson called the FDA hotline to sound an alarm about the rampant issues in the clinical trials at Ventavia. She then followed up with an email to the agency in which she outlined the many breaches of Pfizer’s protocol that she witnessed daily.\n\nThese failures included participants being placed in a hallway after injection, unmonitored by clinical staff, and lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events.\n\nOther breaches of protocol concerned the vaccines themselves not being stored at proper temperatures, and thus losing potency.\n\nJackson also noted that participants’ information was often mislabeled, and that Ventavia staff who reported problems of this nature were “targeted.”\n\nWithin hours of her email to the FDA, Jackson received a response thanking her for her concerns and notifying her that the FDA could not comment on any investigation that might result.\n\nShe was fired by Ventavia the very same day, the lawsuit claims.\n\nFDA Turns Blind Eye\n\nDespite being notified of the problems with Ventavia in September 2020, Pfizer has nevertheless continued its relationship with the Ventavia up to the present, hiring it as a research subcontractor for at least four other trials.\n\nThese include the conducting of vaccine trials for children, young adults, pregnant women, as well as trials testing the safety of a booster dose.\n\nIn addition, the FDA, despite knowledge of the allegations against Pfizer and Ventavia, went ahead and granted Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer vaccine in Nov 2020, including for children 5 to 11 years old.\n\nThe BMJ, in turn, was targeted for publishing the expose on the company. Facebook deleted the article and issued warnings to its users not to share it.\n\nJackson’s lawsuit against Pfizer is being watched very carefully as it moves through the courts. Fraud eviscerates all contracts, legal experts say. Pfizer’s immunity from lawsuits for vaccine injury or death will not hold up if courts find that the pharmaceutical companies falsified or hid vaccine data to conceal safety risks.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher for Pfizer and Moderna whose stocks are presently taking a dip compared with expectations, according to Wall Street analyst and former Blackrock portfolio manager Edward Dowd, cited in Desert Review.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this represents a fleeting trend or something more ominous for the pharmaceutical titans, Dowd said, “as public awareness about Covid-19 vaccine injuries and deaths continues to grow.”\n\n*****\n\nThe Case of The Nigerian Children\n\nIn perhaps the most notorious of the lawsuits against Pfizer, Nigeria’s largest state, Kano, sued the pharmaceutical giant in 2002 for a 1996 botched drug trial that allegedly led to multiple deaths and deformities in children.\n\nThe state accused Pfizer of “secretly using children as guinea pigs to test a new Pfizer drug, Trovan, under the guise of a humanitarian gesture.” The government panel called the Trovan fiasco a “clear case of exploitation of the ignorant.”\n\nThe saga began twenty-five years ago, when Pfizer sent a team to Kano, Nigeria, during a meningitis outbreak. “They conducted an unblinded clinical trial involving 200 children, half of whom were given Trovan and half of whom received the gold standard treatment, Ceftriaxone,” writes the Guardian.\n\nEleven Nigerian children died, five after receiving Pfizer’s product and six after receiving lower-than-normal doses of the older established drug.\n\nA Washington Post investigation reported that one 10-year-old girl suffering from meningitis was not taken off experimental Trovan and given standard, proven treatments by Pfizer’s trial managers — when it was clear that her condition was deteriorating. One of her eyes froze. She lost strength and then died.\n\nIt was later claimed that Pfizer did not have proper consent from parents to use an experimental drug on their children and questions were raised over how the trials were operated. Legal action filed against the company alleged that some participants received a dose lower than recommended with possible intent to manipulate the results, leaving many children with brain damage, paralysis or slurred speech.\n\nPublic fury against Pfizer mounted to the point where then Judge Shehu Atiku in Kano ordered arrest warrants for the head of Pfizer in Nigeria, Ngozi Edozien, and the senior officials, Lare Baale and Segun Donguro, after they failed to attend court, according to the Guardian.\n\nPfizer had argued that meningitis and not its antibiotic had led to the deaths of 11 children and harm to dozens of others. But in 2009, after thirteen years of protracted litigation, the company reached an out-of-court settlement with the Kano state government worth $75 million.\n\nThe families of four of the children each collected checks for $175,000 from a compensation trust fund, after submitting DNA samples to show that the dead were their offspring.\n\nA separate whistleblower lawsuit was filed in the case by Pfizer’s former medical director for central research and Yale infectious disease specialist, Juan Walterspiel. The specialist alleged that the company fired him in retaliation for warning before and after the deadly Kano fiasco that the study methods were “improper and unsafe.”\n\nWalterspiel further claimed that Pfizer had bribed Nigerian officials to continue the study and cut safety corners because “stock options and bonuses (were) at stake.” Pfizer allegedly tried to suppress Walterspiel’s allegations but was forced into a settlement after WikiLeaks published diplomatic cables between Pfizer top brass and Nigerian authorities. The cables allegedly showed that Pfizer had attempted to find incriminating information about a Nigerian prosecutor to pressure him to drop the federal lawsuits against Pfizer. According to media reports, Pfizer repudiated these charges as “preposterous.”\n\n*****\n\nPfizer Pled Guilty, But Drug Sales Continued to Soar\n\nStrikingly, even after Pfizer was forced to make huge liability payouts over charges of fraud, those moments of ignominy failed to make a significant dent on the company’s global revenues. Many of the Pfizer drugs now known to be problematic or useless not only remain on the market but continue to enjoy lucrative sales.\n\nAn example is the drug Neurontin, approved for epilepsy. Pfizer trained its staff to promote this drug for at least 11 off-label uses, including bipolar disorder, migraines, and alcohol withdrawal seizures, the British Medical Journal stated.\u200b\n\n“Even after Pfizer pled guilty in 2002 to numerous civil and criminal charges for illegally marketing the drug, and agreed to pay a $430 million criminal fine, sales of the drug continue to soar for off-label purposes it was not intended for,” wrote the BMJ.\n\n“Neurontin rang up sales of billions of dollars in the last decade after doctors began prescribing it for an array of other maladies,” the NY Times noted in 2004.\n\nDr. David Franklin, a microbiologist and former Harvard research fellow, filed a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act in 1996, that shed light on this phenomenon. He charged the company with using “fraudulent scientific evidence” to promote off-label uses of Neurontin, the BMJ article reported.\n\nDr. Franklin’s complaint detailed how Pfizer suppressed study results; planted people in medical audiences to ask questions intended to cast Neurontin in a favorable light; lavished perks on doctors, and used psychological profiling of physicians. All these maneuvers contributed in pumping up annual sales of Neurontin in excess of $1billion, which gave it “blockbuster” status.\n\nFranklin said that the company’s “profoundly effective” promotional efforts were able to offset any negative publicity about Pfizer’s deceptive and illegal marketing practices.\n\nElaborating on this point, John Abramson in Sickening; How Big Pharma Broke American Healthcare, describes how “Pfizer sponsored numerous swanky dinners and held meetings where the pharmaceutical company presented misleading data showing remarkable improvement in many illnesses using Neurontin. But they withheld data “which had shown the drug was significantly worse than placebo.”\n\nAccording to Abramson, doctors are regularly duped into prescribing expensive drugs with extreme side effects, despite evidence that they don’t work, while major pharmaceutical companies rake in record profits.\n\nClinical Data ‘Kept Secret’ from Medical Journals\n\nAt the core of this issue, notes Abramson, “is a corrupted scientific process in which the raw clinical trial data is kept secret from reviewers and medical journals.” Noting that an increasing amount of medical research is funded by drug companies, the author makes the point that the relentless pursuit of ever-higher profits exerts a corrupt influence on the entire medical industry.\n\nThe prevailing incentive is to develop treatments that are profitable, rather than to “determine optimal care,” the author explains. Applied to the man in the street who may be taking meds for bipolar disorder but hears that Neurontin is better for him and decides to switch, this kind of fraudulent information can be life-threatening.\n\n“A lot of people say it’s a benign drug, why make a fuss,” said Franklin. “But it’s not benign when patients exchange an effective, much needed drug for a useless one. That is downright dangerous.”\n\nThe shocking aspect of the story is that Pfizer funded a study and knew as early as 1998 that Neurontin didn’t work in bipolar disorder, a BMJ article about the drug notes. “But they didn’t publish the results until two years later. Yet we still see it prescribed for bipolar disorder.”\n\nIronically, the fate of a whistleblower like Dr. Franklin can be greatly rewarding, but is more often disastrous. The years of litigation, slim chance of winning the lawsuit, and the near certainty of losing one’s job and suffering retaliation and “blackballing,” can be devastating.\n\nOn the other hand, victory can bring a huge windfall, as in Franklin’s case. As part of the settlement agreement with Pfizer, the microbiologist received $24.6 million under whistleblowing legislation.\n\nAnother example of years of litigation culminating in a huge win for the whistleblower is the “Bextra case,” in which Pfizer was forced in 2009 to pay $2.3 billion for its illegal marketing of the drug. After six years of exhausting legal wrangling, whistleblower Ed Kopchinski was allotted an impressive portion of that settlement, more than $50 million.'}}",,2

From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39638-4', 'Headline': 'Swift and extensive Omicron outbreak in China after sudden exit from ...', 'Snippet': 'It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that ...', 'Full_text': 'Understanding the official case count data during the different phases of public health policy\n\nWe first aimed to understand the spread of the Omicron variant in China immediately before the relaxation of zero-COVID (i.e., between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, 2022). Under zero-COVID, testing was mandatory and frequent, leading the official case count data to be a reliable portrayal of the levels of COVID-19 infection in China. Despite the strict measures, such as frequent city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals, the data show a clear exponential increase in COVID-19 cases (caused by the extremely transmissible Omicron variants) shortly before the relaxation of zero-COVID (Fig. 1a). Using a negative binomial regression, we estimated the rate of this exponential growth to be 0.14/day (95% CI: [0.13, 0.15]/day) during this period.\n\nOfficial data after Nov. 11 (when zero-COVID was replaced by 20 Measures and subsequently 10 Measures) report that growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic slowed (Fig. 1a), and eventually the official daily reported cases declined after Nov. 27. This pattern is unexpected. Presumably, the relaxation of strict interventions under zero-COVID would lead to more rapid spread, contrary to what is observed from the official case count data. We reason that the only plausible explanation is the cessation of the requirement for mass testing and rigorous reporting, which led to a rapid decoupling of the surveillance data from the epidemic intensity. As a result, the official case count data after Nov. 11 reflect the rapidly declining detection rate rather than real change in the infection dynamics.\n\nEstimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Nov. and Dec. 2022\n\nTo compensate for the under-reported official case count data after Nov. 11, we collected results from a large online survey conducted on Dec. 26, 2022 by a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security13. The survey reported the fraction of individuals in three categories: those who thought they had never been infected, thought they currently had COVID-19 symptoms, or thought they had been but were no longer symptomatic (see “Methods” for details). Note that these survey categories do not directly correspond to the epidemiological states of susceptible, infected, and recovered, because each person is reporting based on symptoms and does not know their true infectiousness status. In particular, individuals may become infectious before their symptoms begin, and their symptoms may linger even after they are no longer infectious. When interpreted correctly, however, these data should provide insight into the epidemic stage and thus allow inference of the epidemic dynamics.\n\nWe developed an expanded susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that mapped reporting based on symptoms to true infection status. The states of the model are explained in Fig. 2, and equations and further details are provided in “Methods”. We separated the model into three time periods to allow changes in official policy to affect the transmission rate (Fig. 1a). Official case counts were reliable for the first period, up to Nov. 11, due to mandatory and frequent testing. There is no clear observation for the second period, so we simply assumed the transmission rate must be no less than in the first period. The dynamics of the third period were then mainly determined by the population survey data on Dec. 26.\n\nOur model assumes no pre-existing population immunity against Omicron. We calculated the levels of vaccine-induced population immunity against Omicron infection based on published vaccination data14 and the decay of vaccine effectiveness against infection15 (see “Methods” and Fig. S2). We found that the population immunity before the Dec. 2022 wave of Omicron was below 0.1%, and thus would have negligible effect on the model inference.\n\nFitting the model to the case count and survey data, we estimated that the outbreak in China grew exponentially at a rate of 0.15/day (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.13, 0.15]/day) under zero-COVID between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, increased slightly to 0.17 [0.14, 0.17]/day under 20 Measures, and increased dramatically to 0.42 [0.35, 0.44]/day immediately after full exit from zero-COVID (Fig. 1c), with the epidemic then peaking around Dec. 23 (Fig. 1d). This translates to an epidemic doubling time of 4.7 [4.5, 5.4] days, 4.2 [4.0, 5.0] days, and 1.6 [1.6, 2.0] days for the three periods, respectively.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days for Omicron16 (see “Methods”), we calculated the reproductive number, Rexp, during the exponential increase stage of the three periods. It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that the zero-COVID policy prior to relaxation suppressed the transmission of these Omicron variants by 56% [46%, 64%].\n\nOur results suggest that on Dec. 7, the day when full exit from zero-COVID was announced, there were ~1 million new infections. Because of the extremely high rate of spread afterwards, the outbreak ballooned such that 97% [95%, 99%] of the population (i.e., 1.37 billion people) became infected in December. As a result of the exponential nature of the spread, the vast majority of people (88% [83%, 93%] of the population) became infected during the short window of time between Dec. 15 and 31, 2022 (Fig. 1d).\n\nRobustness to model and data assumptions\n\nWe tested the robustness of our findings—particularly, that nearly the entire population became infected in Dec. 2022—to many properties of the data and model.\n\nFirst, we previously assumed that the numbers of confirmed cases from Oct. 28 to Nov. 11 represented the actual number of infected individuals, i.e., that the case reporting rate in China was 100%. This is a reasonable approximation because of the mandatory mass testing in place: all individuals were required to get tested every 2–5 days. However, it is possible that some infected individuals were not detected. We therefore considered an alternative in which the reporting rate was only 50%. Here, the estimated growth rate after Dec. 7 was reduced slightly to 0.40/day, the size of the susceptible population by the end of Dec. remained below 4%, and the epidemic again peaked on Dec. 23 (Fig. S3).\n\nSecond, we previously assumed the Dec. 26 survey results were an unbiased random sample of the entire population. If, however, recovered people were more likely to respond to the survey, or people reported symptoms not due to COVID-19 (e.g., instead due to influenza—an unlikely scenario given the recent report by China CDC5), the numbers of symptomatic or recovered individuals would be over-reported and our growth rate estimate would be too high. We therefore made a large perturbation of the Dec. 26 data by moving 20% of people from each of the symptomatic and recovered categories into the uninfected category. The estimated growth rate was then reduced slightly to 0.39/day after Dec. 7, the size of the susceptible population by Dec. 31 remained below 4%, and the epidemic peak moved slightly to Dec. 24 (Fig. S4).\n\nThird, in our inference of the transmission rates, we fixed many parameter values from the literature. We tested the sensitivity of our results to those assumed values by re-fitting the model using different values. In one strategy, we set the value of each state transition parameter (kE, kIP, kIS, kS, kA, and kT; all defined in Fig. 2, Table S3, Eq. 1) to either 25% higher or lower than our baseline value (Fig. S5). In another strategy, we assigned an appropriate amount of uncertainty to the incubation period, pre-symptomatic period, symptomatic period, generation interval, and time to PCR testing, drew values from each distribution, and derived the state transition parameters (details in Table S3); this was repeated 25 times. In all cases, the median exponential growth rate remained above 0.25/day after Dec. 7, the median size of the population still susceptible by Dec. 31 remained <6% and the 95% CrI remained <10%, and the epidemic peak remained between Dec. 21–25.\n\nFourth, we previously assumed that the entire population is well-mixed. If, however, population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection, such as people who live in urban areas or younger age groups) were also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. To test the impact of population structure on our conclusions, we extended our model to build a meta-population model with two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates. We assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. We considered various scenarios with different assumptions about the contact rates between the two subpopulations and the contact rate in the unsampled population (see Fig. S6 and “Methods”). In general, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and that >90% of the entire population was infected by the end of Dec. (Fig. S7), consistent with our main findings. This suggests that for a virus that transmits extremely efficiently and rapidly, like Omicron, population structure and heterogeneity play only a small role in dictating the overall rate and magnitude of the epidemic, as long as subpopulations are not entirely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, allowing for under-reporting of official case count data before Nov. 11, over-reporting of symptoms in the Dec. 26 survey, uncertainty in parameter values taken from the literature, or population sub-structure did not change our conclusions.\n\nModel validation using additional datasets\n\nWe furthermore validated our results by comparing them against datasets and analyses that were not used in the inference above. First, China CDC subsequently released data on voluntary PCR and antigen tests for most of Dec. 2022 and Jan. 20235. After the full exit from zero-COVID, the test strategy was changed from all population-based to those who request to be tested and groups at risk. The total number of tests declined from a peak of 150 million tests on Dec. 9, to 7.54 million on Jan. 1. The test positivity rate ranged between a few percent to a peak of 29.4% on Dec. 255. Although these data may not directly reveal the magnitude of the true case counts because of the voluntary nature of the reports, they can reveal the pace and the peak timing of the epidemic. We adjusted our model predictions to reflect the nature of voluntary tests (see “Methods”), and found surprisingly close agreement with the national testing data in Dec. 2022 (Fig. 3).\n\nSecond, the Sichuan CDC conducted a large daily survey in which residents of the province reported their infection status, the date of test positivity, and the date of symptom onset17. We found that the exponential growth rate of the epidemic in early Dec. in Sichuan, as measured by test positivity or symptom onset (0.37/day or 0.43/day, respectively; Fig. S8) is remarkably consistent with our estimates above for the country as a whole.\n\nThird, an analysis of self-reported infection rate focused on vaccine efficacy but also reported an epidemic curve18. Based on 2316 survey responses, the study reported that 82.4% of people in China had confirmed cases by Feb. 2023. This number excludes, however, asymptomatic cases that were not revealed by testing. If 9% of infected people never developed symptoms (median value from Fig. S1) and most of those cases were not caught by testing (due to the lack of mandatory testing and the lack of incentive for most non-symptomatic people to test themselves, leading to the high test positivity rate by end-Dec5.), it is likely that more than 90% of people in that survey had been infected. The small sample size of that survey would also induce large uncertainty, leading to a result for the final epidemic size that is not inconsistent with our model-based analysis on larger datasets.\n\nWe modeled the epidemic dynamics of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in China from Nov. to Dec. 2022, during a period when China moved from having strict COVID-19 policies (‘zero-COVID’), to little-to-no intervention efforts. We found that after full exit from zero-COVID, the Omicron variant spread at a very high rate of 0.42/day, with a doubling time of 1.6 days, during early and mid-Dec. before the incidence peaked around Dec. 23. Our point estimate is that 97% of the population (1.4 billion people) was infected during December, with a lower 95% credibility interval of 95% of the population (1.33 billion) and a lower limit in the sensitivity analyses of 90% (1.26 billion). With an infection fatality ratio between 0.1 and 0.2% for the Omicron variant19, we would expect between 1.3 and 2.6 million COVID-19 deaths in China during Dec. 2022 as well as Jan. 2023 (because of the delay from infection to death).\n\nInfection of more than one billion people during one month would lead to a large number of people needing health care, far exceeding the hospital capacity, and thus explains the report that hospitals were overwhelmed during this period6. This outcome emphasizes the need for gradually relaxing intervention efforts (instead of abruptly changing policy) and implementing additional measures (e.g., pharmaceutical strategies) to ‘flatten the curve’9. A slower epidemic wave would help to ease hospital burden, allow sufficient health care for infected people, prevent epidemic overshoot (i.e., a large final epidemic size because of rapid spread20), and ultimately reduce the number of deaths. Such considerations may be of renewed importance later in 2023, when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 may become susceptible to reinfection.\n\nOur results differ from a recent paper by Leung et al.21 that modeled the epidemic dynamics in Beijing over a similar period. First, they estimated that the highest rate of epidemic growth occurred in mid-Nov., a period when substantial intervention efforts were still in place, whereas our estimates suggest the rate of epidemic growth was highest after the full exit from zero-COVID. Second, they estimated that the epidemic incidence in Beijing had two peaks (one on Dec. 10 and another on Dec. 21), whereas we estimated the epidemic in China as a whole peaked on Dec. 23, remarkably consistent with the newly released data from China CDC5 (Fig. 3). These results in Leung et al.21 are strongly driven by the assumption that the overall contact rate is a function of the daily number of subway travelers, which peaked mid-November. However, it is unclear how the number of subway passengers is related to transmission, given that a large fraction of transmission likely occurs in the household22. More generally, it has been shown that human mobility after the first wave of the epidemic in 2020 relates to changes in transmission in complex ways23; the relationship between the mobility measures and transmission can be insignificant in many countries, country-specific, or intervention policy-specific. As a result, the results in Leung et al.21 could be biased by this strong assumption.\n\nOne limitation of our analysis is that it is heavily dependent on the online infection status survey data on Dec. 26. We directly addressed two concerns about these data. First, the survey could over-state the progression of the epidemic if people with symptoms are more likely to take the survey, or if people mistake influenza for COVID-19 symptoms. Recent data from the China CDC report5 shows that among individuals who had influenza-like illnesses and were tested for both COVID-19 and influenza, only a very small fraction were positive for influenza, especially in late Dec. Nevertheless, we artificially increased the proportion of uninfected people in the survey and obtained very similar results. Second, because the survey was conducted online, the demographic characteristics of the participants may be different from the general population. In particular, if a substantial subpopulation did not participate in the survey and also experienced lower rates of spread—for example, people living in sparsely populated areas—our estimate of the total number of people infected could be too high. We tested this assumption by fitting a structured population model and obtained very similar results. Finally, we validated our model findings against other data sources that were not used in our model inference. We found strong concordance with both the estimated peak time of the epidemic and its growth trajectory. These many lines of evidence strongly suggest that our estimation is reliable and robust, despite the limitations of the available data.\n\nAnother piece of evidence supporting our conclusion is the lack of a COVID-19 wave in January 2023 (for example, see the China CDC report5). The Chinese New Year travel rush, i.e., during which many migrant workers and students go back to hometown to celebrate the Chinese New Year, occurred in Jan., and a large fraction of these travel routes would be from cities to rural villages. Presumably, this travel rush would increase the frequency of risky contact substantially throughout China. The fact that there is no indication of any sizable COVID outbreak during this period (e.g., indicators of COVID-19 infection, including positive tests and fever clinic visits, decreased continuously throughout Jan. 20235) strongly suggests that a large majority of individuals are already infected in Dec., as we predicted in the model.\n\nBroader implications for understanding the transmission of the Omicron variant and for public health\n\nUnlike most other countries where there existed sizable levels of population immunity against the Omicron variant arising from recent natural infection and/or vaccination, we estimated that the population in China had very little to no protection against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the growth rate 0.42/day (translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days) during the exponential growth period we estimated may be a good approximation of the intrinsic transmissibility of the variants BA.5 and BF.7 in a densely populated area without population immunity. This is in stark contrast to the growth rate 0.29/day (and an epidemic doubling time of 2.4 days) that we estimated for the Wuhan outbreak before intervention efforts were in place in Jan. 202024. This highlights the extremely high intrinsic transmissibility of the Omicron variant in a naive population.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days16, we estimated the reproductive number during exponential growth, Rexp to be 3.1. Note that a recent study using contact tracing data from Italy estimated the intrinsic generation time to be 6.8 days25, although the realized generation time for household transmission where frequent contacts occur between family members was 3.6 days. This relatively large difference in the estimated generation times suggests another layer of complexity in calculating the reproductive number, i.e., it depends on whether the transmission is mostly driven by household transmission (frequent contacts) or non-household transmission (less frequent contacts), which may change in different epidemiological contexts and epidemic stages. The reproductive number, Rexp, we calculated here is likely accurate when the transmission is dominated by household transmission, e.g., when prevalence is relatively high in a community. However, at the beginning of an epidemic when only a few individuals are infected, the transmission is likely to be a mixture of household and non-household transmission; in this case, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be higher than Rexp we estimated here.\n\nQuantifying the growth rates before and after zero-COVID, we estimated these intervention efforts reduced the transmission of the Omicron variant by around 56%. As a comparison, the effect of lock-down during the spread of the original variant in early 2020 was estimated to be 70–80% in Europe26. Interestingly, the Omicron outbreak in China had already been growing in Nov. 2022 before the relaxation of zero-COVID (albeit at a low rate). This may reflect the high transmissibilty of the variant, and that the stringent measures of the zero-COVID policy were not effectively implemented because of factors such as population noncompliance due to pandemic fatigue. Nonetheless, these results highlight the difficulty of containing a respiratory infection that causes explosive outbreaks and transmits during the presymptomatic or asymptomatic period.\n\nBecause the epidemic grew so rapidly in Dec., we may expect another sizable wave of infection later in 2023 when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 become susceptible to reinfection. The timing and magnitude of the future wave would depend on how quickly the population immunity wanes over time27,28,29 and the ability of newly emerging variants to evade the immunity caused by the Omicron variants30,31. Therefore, modeling efforts that evaluate intervention strategies, including vaccination, will be crucial to reduce the level of infection and mortality.\n\nDatasets and sources\n\nOfficial case counts\n\nNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China had been releasing reports on COVID-19 infections from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 23, 202232. These reports include numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, imported and recovered infections, and deaths across the country. Because the definitions of ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ infections have been changing over time, we use only the total number of cases by summing the two categories. We retrieved all official data from Sina Pandemic Map33, which provides pre-processed and well-organized daily case data from NHC. Note the NHC data are also used as a source for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard34.\n\nPrevalence survey on Dec. 26, 2022\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2022, the RenSheTong online platform (https://m12333.cn), a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, conducted a one-day online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in China13. There were 47,897 participants in total. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was reported in four categories. ‘Uninfected’ was defined as individuals who had never tested positive or were unaware they were infected. ‘Asymptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive, but did not have symptoms of infection at the time of the survey. ‘Symptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they were infected, and were experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey. ‘Recovered’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they had been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had recovered from symptoms of infection. We interpreted the last category to imply recovered from recent infection, i.e., in end-2022, but there would be little consequence if it also included people who had been infected in previous years because <1% of the population had been infected prior to Nov. 202234. Survey questions are reproduced in Table S2 and survey results by province are provided in a supplemental data file. Because of the small number of respondents in the Asymptomatic category, our analyses folded them in with the Uninfected category, which already included individuals who could be infected but without symptoms. Note that in the survey 95% of infected people reported symptoms, which is consistent with the fraction of infections estimated to be symptomatic by our model (Fig. S1). We computed the total number of people in each survey category under the assumption that the proportion of survey respondents in each category was representative of the respective province as a whole. That is, the prevalences in Fig. 1b are the country’s total population size multiplied by 28.3% Uninfected, 42.5% Infected, and 29.2% Recovered.\n\nParticipants in the survey were also asked about the duration of symptoms. We fitted an Erlang distribution to the survey data by estimating the mean of the distribution and adjusting the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution from 1 to 10.\n\nChinese CDC reports of number of positive tests after Dec. 9, 2022\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released national COVID-19 pandemic data on Jan. 25, 2023, including PCR test results, antigen test results, outpatient and inpatient data, variant surveillance data, and vaccination progress across the country5. Data were collected from official surveillance systems, labs, hospitals, and mobile applications where residents could upload their antigen test results voluntarily. We used daily numbers of positive PCR and antigen tests and daily test positivity rates.\n\nSichuan survey on Dec. 25 and 26, 2022\n\nThe Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Health conducted an online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in Sichuan province on Dec. 24 and 2517. There were a total of 158,506 participants. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was categorized as ‘uninfected’ or ‘tested positive either by PCR or antigen test.’ In addition, participants reported the date that they tested positive and the date of their symptom onset.\n\nCopies of all datasets are included as supplemental files.\n\nThe expanded SEIR model\n\nWe developed an SEIR-type model to encompass not only the daily case counts from extensive official testing, but also the survey data in which respondents’ answers were based on symptoms. In this model, we categorized the population into 12 classes, plus 2 additional classes for bookkeeping: S for susceptible, E1 and E2 for exposed, IP for pre-symptomatic and infectious, IS for symptomatic and infectious, RS1, RS2, and RS3 for recovered from infectiousness but still symptomatic, RS for recovered and no longer with symptoms, IA1 and IA2 for asymptomatic and infectious, and RA for recovered and never having symptoms. Multiple stages were used for some categories (e.g., stages E1 and E2 for the exposed category) in order to obtain more realistic distributions of waiting times35, as discussed below. States T1 and T2 were used to record individuals who test positive, in order to compare with daily case counts. Figure 2 shows how individuals transit from one class to another. Parameters ki govern the rates of flow from one class to the next, f is the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms, and w is the proportion of cases found by testing. The system of equations defining this model is:\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N$$\n\n(1a)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{1}}{dt}=\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N-{k}_{E}{E}_{1}$$\n\n(1b)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{E}{E}_{1}-{k}_{E}{E}_{2}$$\n\n(1c)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{P}}{dt}={k}_{E}f{E}_{2}-{k}_{IP}{I}_{P}$$\n\n(1d)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{IP}{I}_{P}-{k}_{IS}{I}_{S}$$\n\n(1e)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S1}}{dt}={k}_{IS}{I}_{S}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S1}$$\n\n(1f)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S2}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S1}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S2}$$\n\n(1g)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S3}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S2}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1h)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1i)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A1}}{dt}={k}_{E}(1-f){E}_{2}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A1}$$\n\n(1j)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A2}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A1}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1k)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{A}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1l)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{1}}{dt}={k}_{E}w{E}_{2}-{k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1m)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1n)\n\nIn this model, susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals (in compartments IP + IS + IA1 + IA2) through contacts at rate β. Infected individuals first become exposed but not infectious. We used two compartments (E1 and E2) to model this period to reflect the fact that the distribution of the exposed period (i.e., from infection to becoming infectious) usually follows a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution. Exposed individuals then become infectious, and IP and IS represent infectious individuals at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively. Individuals lose infectiousness a few days after symptom onset36, whereas symptoms may last for a longer period of time. Stages RS1, RS2, and RS3 describe symptomatic individuals who are no longer infectious. Again, using three stages allows us to match the distribution of the symptomatic period to the distribution estimated from data13. Note that, in the survey, participants in the ‘infected’ category were categorized based on whether the participants have COVID symptoms or not. Therefore, the ‘infected’ category corresponds to individuals in the states IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3. When individuals recover from symptoms, they enter state RS.\n\nOur model also keeps track of asymptomatically infected individuals, i.e., individuals who never develop symptoms throughout infection. In the model, we assume a fraction, 1 − f, of individuals remain asymptomatic after the exposed period. We use two IA stages to describe the duration of infectious period as a gamma distribution. RA keeps track of individuals recovered from asymptomatic infection. We do not differentiate the stages of individuals recovering from asymptomatic infection (as we did for individuals recovering from symptomatic infection) because individuals in all of these stages would have reported as the same category in the symptoms-based survey, and they remain in this class.\n\nOverall, our model structure allowed us to map our model states to the categories in the Dec. 26 online survey. People who reported themselves ‘uninfected’ could be truly susceptible (S), asymptomatic but exposed (E1, E2) or infected (IA1, IA2), or recovered never having had symptoms (RA). People who reported themselves ‘infected’ were experiencing symptoms, so they could be still infectious (IS) or no longer infectious (RS1, RS2, RS3). People reporting themselves ‘recovered’ were no longer experiencing symptoms (RS).\n\nTo fit the model to official COVID-19 case counts, we used T1 and T2 to keep track of individuals who would eventually be tested. Note that they do not contribute to the transmission dynamics. Parameter w is the fraction of infected individuals who are tested, and it ranges between 0 and 1. The waiting time from becoming infectious to being tested positive is 1/kT.\n\nParameter values and statistical inference\n\nWe fixed most of the parameters in the model to values estimated from epidemiological studies. We used an incubation period for Omicron of mean 3.4 days37 and a generation interval for Omicron of mean 3.3 days16. Both distributions can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 3, so in our model there are three states describing individuals who are infected but yet to develop symptoms (E1, E2, and IP). We then set the rate parameters kE = 2/1.9 /day and kIP = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean pre-symptomatic infectious period is 1.5 days38 and total incubation period is 3.4 days37, and kIS = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean infectious period after symptom onset is 1.5 days.\n\nWe estimated from the population survey data (Table S2) that the distribution of the symptomatic period can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.7 days and a shape parameter of 413. Therefore, in our model, we used four states to represent the symptomatic period (IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3), and we set kS = 3/4.2 /day such that the mean duration that an individual is in the RS1, RS2 or RS3 state is 4.2 days and thus the mean symptomatic period is 4.2 + 1.5 = 5.7 days. We also set 2/kA = 1/kIP + 1/kIS such that the mean infectious period of the asymptomatically infected is assumed the same as symptomatically infected. Parameter values are summarized in Table S3.\n\nOur model contained six free parameters: the transmission rate during each of the three periods (βi), the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms (f), an initial number of exposed individuals in mid-Oct. (E0), and an overdispersion parameter for the count data (ϕ), which were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.\n\nFor the initial condition of the ODE system, we assumed an entirely susceptible population except for E1 = E2 ≡ E0 on Oct. 22, one week before the beginning of the case count data we fit. This is consistent with very little pre-existing immunity through either prior natural infection (<1% of the population had ever been infected by this time34) or vaccination (Fig. S2). The model was fit using Bayesian inference and implemented in the Stan programming language39. We set the prior distribution of each βi to be normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 2, the prior on f to be uniform between 0 and 1, the prior on E0 to be uniform between 1 and ten times the number of cases on the first day of data, and the prior on ϕ−1 to be exponential with mean 5. These are weak priors, and the posterior estimates (shown in Fig. S1) were not sensitive to them.\n\nThe growth rate, r, during the exponential growth period of the outbreak was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the ODE system, Eq. 1, assuming the population is fully susceptible (i.e., S = N).\n\nCalculation of the reproductive number during exponential growth, R exp\n\nWe used the growth rates, r, of SARS-CoV-2 in China estimated in this study and the distribution of the intrinsic generation interval to calculate the reproductive number Rexp. This is the estimated instantaneous reproductive number during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak after Dec. 8 and before the peak. According to Abbott et al.16, the distribution of the generation interval has a mean of 3.3 days and a shape parameter close to 3. Rexp is then calculated using the formula provided in Park et al.40:\n\n$${R}_{exp}=\\frac{1}{\\int\\,g(\\tau )\\exp (-r\\tau )d\\tau }$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g is the density function of the intrinsic generation interval distribution.\n\nRegression to estimate exponential growth rates\n\nThe rates of exponential growth in Sichuan province during Dec. 2022 were estimated by fitting a linear regression model to the fractions of COVID-19-positive individuals or individuals whose symptoms began between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The Dec. 1 data point was ignored because it is likely to include individuals who tested positive or started to have symptoms before Dec. 1. The fitting was performed using the lm() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nWe estimated the rate of exponential growth using the official case count data by fitting a generalized negative binomial regression to the case count time series. Fitting was performed with the glm.nb() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nEstimating population immunity against Omicron infection\n\nLau et al.15 estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the CoronaVac vaccine against Omicron infection: 7 days following immunization, the VE for the second and third doses were 5% (0–27%) and 30% (1–66%), respectively, and then the VE reduced exponentially to 1% (0–11%) and 6% (0–29%), respectively, 100 days after immunization. We used these values in our calculation, assuming that all the vaccines administered in China follow the same VE characteristics as CoronaVac. We then collected data on the fractions of people who already received two doses or three doses of vaccine over time from ref. 14 (Fig. S2a). From this dataset, we estimated the fractions of people newly vaccinated with their second or third dose over the entire period of consideration. Note that the fourth dose of vaccine was not authorized in China until mid-Dec. 2022, and therefore we did not include the fourth dose in our calculation.\n\nWe calculated the population immunity against Omicron on day d, P(d), as\n\n$$P(d)=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i={d}_{0}}^{d}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=2}^{3}{G}_{j}(d-i){Q}_{j}(i)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qj(i) is the fraction newly vaccinated with the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i, and Gj(d − i) is the VE on day d given an individual received the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i. The expected and upper bound estimates (Fig. S2b) were made using the expected and upper bound estimates of the VE.\n\nRobustness of conclusions to existence of population structure\n\nWe considered the impact of population structure on the main conclusions of our model. If population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection) are also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. For example, people who live in urban areas with good internet access and health care facilities may be more likely to be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey, while also experiencing more opportunity for infection; whereas people living in rural areas (far away from testing facilities and with poor internet connections) may not be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey. Another example is that people in younger age groups may have larger numbers of contacts and be more likely to participate in online surveys than people in older age groups.\n\nTo capture this effect as simply as possible, we included two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates, with an even lower rate of contact between the two subpopulations. Specifically, we assumed that during each time period, the transmission rate in the low-contact subpopulation was half that of the high-contact subpopulation, and the transmission rate between subpopulations was one-tenth as large. We also assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. The full model structure is provided in Fig. S6.\n\nWe first partitioned the entire country’s population to be 65% in the high-contact subpopulation and 35% in the low-contact subpopulation. This partition is motivated by the nationwide urban–rural proportion. Because the Dec. 26 survey includes participants from both urban and rural areas, this division represents an overestimate of the size of the unsampled population. Indeed, the majority of population in China has good internet access (through cell phones) and access to COVID-testing sites. Therefore we additionally considered a model where the population is partitioned to be 80% in the high-contact subpopulation and 20% in the low-contact subpopulation, which is probably more appropriate with respect to the survey data. We fit both models to the official case count data and the Dec. 26 survey data as in the main text. Irrespective of the partition, our results from this model were consistent with our main findings. For the 80%–20% and 65%–35% partitions, respectively, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and only 2.6% or 6.7% of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of December (Fig. S7ab).\n\nWe further tested a scenario where the partition is 80% and 20% for the sampled and unsampled subpopulations, respectively, and transmission between the subpopulations was only one-hundredth of the transmission rate within the sampled subpopulation. Note that this is an extreme and unlikely scenario where the two subpopulations were not well connected at all. We found that infection in the low-contact subpopulation lagged behind the high-contact subpopulation even more than in the previous scenarios, as expected (Fig. S7c). The amount of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of Dec. increased slightly to 10.9%, and the epidemic peak remained on Dec. 23.\n\nModel adjustment for testing intensity and willingness in the China CDC data\n\nWe compared the fitted model trajectory against the China CDC data to validate our model estimations. For this, we multiplied the total cases predicted by the model by a factor to correct for testing effort and the willingness to get tested. We defined\n\n$$T=C\\frac{{n}_{T}/{p}_{T}}{(N-R)v},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the model-adjusted inferred number of positive tests (plotted as colored bands in Fig. 3), C is the total number of model-predicted cases (gray band in Fig. 3), nT is the number of positive tests, pT is the test positivity rate, N is the total country population size, R is the number of individuals in the recovered non-symptomatic model states (RS + RA), and v is an unknown factor related to the proportion of the population that engages in voluntary testing. The term (N − R)v reflects that not all individuals engage in the testing and among those who engage, individuals who know they are recovered likely do not get tested or self-test any more. Values of all the quantities in Eq. (4) are known for each day—from the model fit or the reported data—except for v. We estimated a single value of v (across all days) for each testing type by least-squares fitting, using Eq. (4), obtaining v = 0.44 for the PCR tests and v = 0.52 for the antigen tests.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Covid', 'Headline': 'Zero-COVID - Wikipedia', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. [ 1 ] [ a ] In contrast to the "" living with COVID-19 "" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression ...', 'Full_text': 'COVID-19 elimination strategy\n\n""Zero-COVID policy"" redirects here. For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b0c2f6fa-7164-4cf5-80ad-db029a5b66de', 'Headline': 'China retreats from sweeping zero-Covid policies as economic toll mounts', 'Snippet': 'The new measures, outlined on Wednesday by the State Council, China’s cabinet, were foreshadowed by a meeting of the Chinese Communist party’s politburo that emphasised the importance of ...', 'Full_text': ""Then €69 per month.

Sign up here.\n\nZhou, an auto dealer in northeastern China, last saw his father alive in a video chat on the afternoon of November 1, hours after their home on the far outskirts of Beijing was locked down.\n\nAt the time, they didn’t even realize the snap Covid restrictions had been imposed – there was no warning beforehand, and the apartment building where Zhou’s parents and his 10-year-old son lived did not have any cases, he said.\n\nThe family found out the hard way, when Zhou’s father was denied immediate emergency medical help after he suddenly began struggling to breathe during the video call. Zhou and his son made a dozen calls for an ambulance, he said, claiming security guards blocked relatives from entering the building to take the 58-year-old grandfather to a hospital.\n\nAn hour later, an ambulance finally arrived to drive Zhou’s father to a hospital just five minutes away. But it was too late to save him.\n\n“The local government killed my dad,” Zhou told CNN in his Beijing home, breaking down in tears. He said he’s received no explanation about why the ambulance took so long to arrive, just a death certificate stating the wrong date of death.\n\nZhou’s anger is part of a growing torrent of dissent toward China’s unrelenting zero-Covid lockdowns, which officials insist are necessary to protect people’s lives against a virus that, according to the official count, has killed just six people from tens of thousands of symptomatic cases reported in the last six months.\n\nBut increasingly, the restrictions – not the virus – are being blamed for heartbreaking deaths that have sparked nationwide outrage on social media.\n\nOn the same day Zhou lost his father, a 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning in a locked-down compound in the northwestern city of Lanzhou, after he was blocked from being taken promptly to a hospital. Two weeks later, a 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine in the central city of Zhengzhou after a 12-hour delay in medical care.\n\nMany more families, like Zhou’s, have likely suffered similar tragedies outside the social media spotlight.\n\nZhou said he contacted several state media outlets in Beijing to report on his story, but no reporters came. Amid growing desperation and anger, he turned to foreign media – despite knowing the risk of repercussions from the government. CNN is only using his surname to mitigate that risk.\n\n“I just want to get justice for my dad. Why did you lock us down? Why did you take my dad’s life away?” he said.\n\nGrowing discontent\n\nAcross China, anger and frustration with zero-Covid has reached new heights and led to rare scenes of protest, as local authorities rushed to reintroduce restrictions amid record infections – despite a recent government announcement of a limited easing of some rules.\n\nLast week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted against an extended lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching down streets.\n\nIn the central city of Zhengzhou this week, workers at the world’s biggest iPhone assembly factory clashed with hazmat-suited security officers over a delay in bonus payment and chaotic Covid rules.\n\nAnd on Thursday, in the sprawling metropolis of Chongqing in the southwest, a resident delivered a searing speech criticizing the Covid lockdown on his residential compound. “Without freedom, I would rather die!” he shouted to a cheering crowd, who hailed him a “hero” and wrestled him from the grip of several police officers who had attempted to take him away.\n\nThese acts of defiance echoed an outpouring of discontent online, notably from Chinese football fans – many under some form of lockdown or restrictions – who have only been able to watch from home as tens of thousands of raucous fans pack stadiums at the World Cup in Qatar.\n\n“None of the fans are seen wearing face masks, or told to submit proof of Covid test results. Are they not living on the same planet as us?” asked a Wechat article questioning China’s insistence on zero-Covid, which went viral before it was censored.\n\nThere are signs that Chinese officials are feeling the heat of the growing public discontent, which came on top of the heavy social and economic tolls inflicted by the widening lockdowns.\n\nEarlier this month, the Chinese government released a 20-point guideline to limit the disruption of zero-Covid rules on daily life and the economy. It shortened quarantine from 10 to eight days for close contacts of infected people and for inbound travelers. It also scrapped quarantine requirements for secondary contacts, discouraged unnecessary mass testing drives and removed a major restriction on international flights.\n\nThe announcement had raised hopes of a pivot toward reopening, triggering a rally of Chinese stocks. But a surge in infections as China heads into its fourth winter of the pandemic is quickly dampening such hopes. On Friday, the country reported a record 32,695 local cases, as infections for a second straight day surpassed the previous peak recorded in April during Shanghai’s months-long lockdown.\n\nWhat reopening?\n\nInstead of relaxing controls, many local officials are reverting to the zero-tolerance playbook, attempting to stamp out infections as soon as they flare up.\n\nSome of the cities that dropped mass testing requirements following the announcement are already tightening other Covid restrictions.\n\nThe northern city of Shijiazhuang was among the first to cancel mass testing. It also allowed students to return to schools after a long period of online classes. But as cases rose over the weekend, authorities reimposed a lockdown on Monday, telling residents to stay home.\n\nOn Tuesday, financial hub Shanghai banned anyone arriving in the city from entering venues including shopping malls, restaurants, supermarkets and gyms for five days. Authorities also shut down cultural and entertainment venues in half of the city.\n\nIn Guangzhou, officials this week extended the lockdown on Haizhu district – where the protest took place – for the fifth time, and locked down its most populous Baiyun district.\n\nZhengzhou, home to the Foxconn factory where workers clashed with police, imposed a five-day lockdown on its main urban districts.\n\nIn Beijing, streets in its largest district of Chaoyang are largely empty as authorities urged residents to stay home and ordered businesses to shut. Schools across several districts also moved to online classes this week.\n\nLow vaccination rates among China’s elderly have led to fears that a loosening of restrictions could overwhelm the country’s health system. As of November 11, about two-thirds of people age 80 and older had received two doses, and only 40% had received a booster shot.\n\nYanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the re-tightening of Covid controls reflected a typical public policy dilemma in China: “If you relax the policy, there will be chaos; but if you tighten up, it will be stifling.”\n\nHuang said he does not expect any fundamental changes to the zero-Covid policy in the short term. “Because the local governments’ incentive structure has not been changed. They are still held accountable for the Covid situation in their jurisdiction,” he said.\n\nFor their part, Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that the 20 measures listed in the government guidelines were meant for a pivot to living with the virus.\n\nThe measures are about “optimizing” existing Covid prevention and control policy, Shen Hongbing, a disease control official, told a news conference last week. “They are not an easing (of control), let alone reopening or ‘lying flat’,” he said.\n\nBack on the outskirts of Beijing, Zhou said while the zero-Covid policy “is beneficial to the majority,” its implementation at a local level had been too draconian.\n\n“I don’t want things like this to happen again in China and anywhere in the world,” he said. “I lost my father. My son lost his beloved grandfather. I’m furious now.”'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6182781/china-zero-covid-economic-crisis/', 'Headline': 'China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Causing An Economic Crisis - TIME', 'Snippet': 'On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with ...', 'Full_text': 'In mid-May, I traveled from London to Slovenia to interview the Ukrainian men’s soccer team on their bid to reach November’s Qatar World Cup. It was a four-day assignment, requiring travel via train stations, airports, and taxi ranks—but at no point was I asked to show a negative COVID-19 test, my vaccination status, nor even to wear a facemask. I can barely recall seeing anyone wear one, least of all the elite sportsmen with whom I mingled daily. It was equally refreshing and disconcerting—as if Europe had forgotten that the pandemic had ever happened and was indeed still happening.\n\nIt was on this trip that a news alert flashed on my phone: China, on May 14, announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Asian Football Confederation Cup—the continent’s premier international soccer tournament—due to a COVID-19 outbreak that, on that same day, was responsible for only 65,000 cases and 45 deaths nationwide. That China is still wedded to a stringent zero-COVID policy focused on stamping out every infection, rather than mitigating severe illness and deaths, wasn’t a secret to anyone following the harsh lockdown endured by the 26 million residents of Shanghai, its biggest city, over the last two months. Still, it was surprising because Beijing, not too long ago, hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics without seeding a major outbreak and China’s leadership relishes in the prestige that accompanies these major sporting events. But what caught my eye most was the timing: the nixed tournament didn’t kick off until June 2023.\n\nWhat it suggests is that China has no intention of following the West into a vaccine-powered “living with the virus” dynamic. That’s bad news for China’s own economy and for any diminishing hopes worldwide of avoiding a global recession. Over the last two decades, China has contributed a quarter of the rise in global GDP—in that time, the first quarter of 2020 was the only one when its economy did not expand. Today, however, more than 200 million Chinese live under pandemic restrictions, battering an already slowing economy. Retail sales in April were 11% lower year-on-year, while housing sales—comprising over a fifth of GDP—plummeted 47% over the same period. Unemployment across a sample of 31 major Chinese cities is now the highest per official data since records began in 2018. Scenes from early May of workers fighting with public health officials at a factory producing Apple MacBooks in Shanghai after they were refused permission to leave their workplace to rest at on-site dormitories spotlights the mounting friction between economic priorities and public health.\n\n“Ordinary Chinese people have felt the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Party in a much more direct and personal way than many people, especially young people, have before,” says Astrid Nordin, the Lau Chair of Chinese International Relations at Kings College London.\n\nRead more: China, Isolated From the World, Is Now the Last Major Country Still Pursuing a ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy\n\nSince China began market reforms in the late 1970s, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rooted its legitimacy in improving livelihoods. But over the last two years, President Xi Jinping has seized on China’s success conquering the virus as proof of the superiority of its political system over the West. These two success stories are now in direct conflict. On May 25, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held an emergency meeting with over 100,000 party members where he warned China’s current economic woes were in some ways greater than the initial impact of the pandemic in 2020 and indicated that the annual growth target of 5.5% was unobtainable.\n\n“The economic crisis owing to draconian measures to control the outbreak really shows the mess, miscoordination, and miscalculations by leadership at the top,” says Valarie Tan, an analyst on Chinese elite politics for the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “We’re finally seeing the full manifestation of this ideological turn by Xi Jinping.”\n\nStill, nobody expects Beijing to abandon its zero-COVID policy anytime soon. It’s especially sensitive for Xi as the 20th CCP Congress approaches in the fall, when the strongman is expected to assume a third five-year presidential term, ripping up the longstanding convention that leaders only serve two. The prospect of COVID-19 running amok while he takes this historic step won’t be countenanced. On May 5, the CCP’s Politburo’s standing committee, China’s apex political body, said zero-COVID was “determined by the nature and purpose of the Party,” thus expressly linking it with CCP legitimacy, while declaring that relaxing controls would lead to “massive numbers of infections, critical cases and deaths.”\n\nDespite the ideological nature of China’s zero-COVID obsession, this grim prognosis is not hyperbole. According to a study published May 10 by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, Indiana University, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in China could lead to 112 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in just three months. This is above all because China has not fully vaccinated 100 million of its 264 million citizens over 60, or 38%. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a wave of the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to some of the world’s worst daily mortality rates in recent months, with 95% of those deaths in over-60s who hadn’t been fully vaccinated.\n\nRead more: How Hong Kong Became China’s Biggest COVID-19 Problem\n\nIn this regard, China is a victim both of its success in stemming the spread of less transmissible variants and of its backslapping propaganda. Elderly people with scant desire to travel abroad saw no need to get vaccinated against a virus that the state had triumphantly declared vanquished. Meanwhile, owing to a pernicious blend of national security and national pride, China has not approved any foreign vaccines, meaning it doesn’t have access to the most effective types, which are those based on mRNA technology. Homegrown alternatives have spotty efficacy.\n\nNot that it really matters in a place where zero-COVID is the iron-clad law of the land. Even the best COVID-19 vaccines do not eliminate transmission, but they do slow the spread and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms. However, that renders them incompatible with any zero-COVID strategy, which doesn’t differentiate between mild or severe cases, or those in young and old. The policy targets infections, period, not sickness or deaths. “This is why it’s so political,” says Dr. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City–based Council on Foreign Relations. “Unless they abandon their zero-COVID mindset there’s really no way out of this.” Little wonder even the WHO says that zero-COVID is unsustainable.\n\nThe Chinese public are wising up to this fact and complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic have become common even on the nation’s heavily censored social media. This has led to a new official edict: jingmo, or silence. Stop grumbling, in other words. During that May 5 Politburo standing committee meeting, Xi vowed to crack down on “all words and deeds that distort, doubt, and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Ominously, China’s National Health Commission chief Ma Xiaowei wrote in CCP ideological journal Qiushi on May 16 that more “permanent” quarantine hospitals must be built and weekly testing “normalized.”\n\nNot hosting the AFC Cup won’t do much damage to China’s global reputation. But rolling lockdowns, which are sending China’s factories screeching to a halt, with cascading detrimental effects all the way down global supply chains, will make commercial partners look elsewhere. In Shanghai, China’s biggest port responsible for one-fifth of the country’s international shipping, average waiting time for import containers was 12.9 days on May 12, up from 7.4 days compared to six weeks earlier, according to shipment tracker Project 44. Over half of American businesses in China either delayed or decreased investments in China due to lockdown measures, according to a recent survey by the local U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThanks to current measures, “China might be seen as a less reliable trading partner than previously,” says Nordin, of Kings College. “The question is how much less reliable than other possible alternatives?”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/china/china-zero-covid-impact-beijing-intl-hnk-mic/index.html', 'Headline': 'China scraps virus tracking app as country braces for Covid impact', 'Snippet': 'China is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading ...', 'Full_text': 'Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nChina is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.\n\nChanges continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.\n\nThe system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.\n\nIt had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.\n\nBut as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.\n\nThroughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/01/china/china-protests-zero-covid-position-intl-hnk-mic/index.html', 'Headline': 'Analysis: China signals it could soften its zero-Covid policy, but ...', 'Snippet': 'Case numbers in the past week have hovered around record highs, with more than 34,000 new infections reported Thursday – posing a steep challenge to efforts to return them to a low level ...', 'Full_text': 'China has given its most significant signal yet that it may adjust its stringent zero-Covid policy that has transformed daily life, roiled the economy – and sparked a wave of protests.\n\nThe top official in charge of China’s Covid response told health officials Wednesday that the country faced a “new stage and mission” in pandemic control.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said Wednesday, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe remarks follow a surge in public frustration with zero-Covid and its high human cost, which erupted into unprecedented demonstrations in at least 19 cities since last Friday.\n\nSun – who has been the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s enforcement of the policy – made no mention of “zero-Covid,” as reported by Xinhua. Her comments came a day after a separate body of top health officials pledged to rectify some approaches to Covid control and said local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nOn Thursday, Sun reiterated the new tone, telling a health symposium in Beijing that China’s health care and disease control systems now had “effective diagnosis and treatment techniques” against the epidemic. Overall, China had “created conditions for the country to further optimize its prevention and control measures,” she said, according to state media.\n\nThe high-level statements – alongside minor adjustments of rules and some easing of lockdown measures in major cities in recent days – suggest China is bending under pressure on the policy, which has become increasingly disruptive as it struggles to counter highly transmissible variants and record case numbers.\n\nBut the shifting tone has not come with any road map to an end goal or mention of transitioning away from zero-Covid, and it remains uncertain how it will impact realities on the ground or ease mounting public frustration.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\nLocal officials may be reticent to let cases rise for fear of retribution from a central government that has long prided itself on its zero-Covid stance. Meanwhile, experts say, the country continues to lag in key areas of preparedness for a widespread outbreak.\n\nTone shift\n\nChinese health officials and experts have long argued that the costs of the zero-Covid policy are scientifically justified, citing uncertainties in how the virus will evolve, unknowns about its long-term effects, and gaps in medical preparedness, including a lagging elderly vaccination rate and inadequate intensive care infrastructure – especially in rural areas.\n\nThese weaknesses, they have warned, could see the health care system overwhelmed if the virus spreads freely in the country of 1.4 billion – a situation that could exacerbate the deaths expected with an opening up.\n\nThis remains a key concern for the government, according to health security expert Nicholas Thomas at the City University of Hong Kong, who said: “There is still a substantial part of the population that is trusting in the government’s actions in dealing with the virus. An unmanaged engagement with the virus could not only erode that trust but it could also expose vulnerable populations (to risk).”\n\nOfficials’ recent comments around the policy are “not a sign that China is ready to transition to living with Covid, but a sign that the virus has slipped out of control and that the government is unable to return to a zero-Covid environment,” he said.\n\nCase numbers in the past week have hovered around record highs, with more than 34,000 new infections reported Thursday – posing a steep challenge to efforts to return them to a low level.\n\nThere have, however, been recent signs of efforts to shift public perception about the virus, following years of focusing on its risks.\n\nA number of media outlets picked up a piece by state-run Global Times citing “recent research” from Chinese scientists showing the comparative “decreased pathogenicity” of the Omicron variant. Others shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid — a sharp contrast to previous state media coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe government’s own narrative about the success of zero-Covid and its backing by leader Xi Jinping partly explain why China has long maintained the policy, according to Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nAfter bringing its initial outbreak in Wuhan under control in 2020, China’s border restrictions and swift method of detecting and suppressing the virus allowed the country to live relatively virus-free, while hospitals in many parts of the world were overrun with sick and dying patients. By China’s official count, it has seen only 5,233 Covid-19 deaths since early 2020, with fewer than 600 reported in 2022.\n\nXi has touted China’s measures and its relatively low number of Covid deaths as a triumph of Chinese governance. The country stuck to that system even as others transitioned to living with the virus following mass vaccinations and the spread of the milder, but highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nEven as Omicron made China’s controls less effective, Beijing continued to prioritize resources for lockdowns, mass testing and forced quarantines over preparing for wide spread of the virus, observers say.\n\n“The number one (reason) is propaganda – they want to claim that China is doing a much better job than the United States,” said Wu, adding that expanding state control over the population could be another motivation for maintaining the zero-Covid policy – as Xi has stressed state security as a key policy goal.\n\nBut while pursuing this strategy, China “lost so many golden opportunities,” to prepare to live with the virus, and to prepare the public for a larger scale of deaths from Covid-19, he said.\n\nPrepared?\n\nOne concern among health officials about relaxing controls is the low level of vaccination in the elderly population most vulnerable to Covid-19 – a weakness that Beijing on Tuesday launched a new plan to address.\n\nAs of November 11, 40% of China’s over-80 population had received a booster shot, according to state media, while around two-thirds had received two doses – a result of both vaccine hesitancy and an initial roll-out that did not prioritize the elderly.\n\nA World Health Organization advisory group last year recommended that elderly people taking China’s inactivated-virus vaccines receive three doses in their initial course to ensure sufficient protection. Vaccine protection is known to wane over time and decrease against Omicron.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s immunity rests almost entirely on vaccination as so few people have been exposed to the virus. Around 90% of the population is fully vaccinated. While China’s vaccines have been shown to protect against severe disease and death, studies show they offer lower antibody protection than the mRNA vaccines used widely elsewhere in the world. Beijing has yet to approve any mRNA vaccine.\n\nA stark warning of the risks for mainland China played out in Hong Kong, where low vaccination rates among that most at-risk group played a role in pushing the Chinese territory’s Covid-19 death rates to some of the highest in the world last spring.\n\nWhile vaccination will not eliminate an increase in deaths when restrictions ease, shots and boosters, and other preparations to reduce risks, are critical for countries transitioning away from policies aimed at “zero-Covid,” according to infectious disease physician Peter Collignon of the Australian National University Medical School.\n\n“The preparation isn’t just vaccines, it’s surge capacity, it’s making sure you have enough hospital staff, you have enough beds and particularly making sure the elderly (are protected),” he said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nChina has signaled it may make more concerted efforts to bolster its defenses against the virus. Officials on Tuesday released an action plan to boost elderly vaccination rates. This echoed a target mentioned in a 20-point plan to optimize zero-Covid measures, released last month, which also called for hospitals to increase intensive treatment facilities and to stockpile anti-viral drugs and medical equipment.\n\nThe same notice also relaxed certain measures around testing and quarantine, and cautioned against excesses in policy enforcement at the local level – all messages that have been echoed by top health officials in recent days.\n\nAfter that guidance – and in the wake of the recent protests – state media has highlighted a number of cities making minor changes to their policies, largely around testing and quarantine rules.\n\nBut some social media users remained skeptical, saying the changes to testing requirements were too minor to ease the impact of zero-Covid on daily life.\n\nThe northeastern city of Jinzhou on Friday announced it would gradually restore some normal operations in its main urban area – just one day after saying it would not follow other cities by relaxing measures ahead of schedule.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in the southern hub of Guangzhou relaxed lockdowns in four districts and eased a quarantine requirement. And in Xinjiang’s Urumqi on Saturday, local officials said they would gradually ease lockdown measures in neighborhoods categorized as “low risk,” and moved to reopen essential businesses and public transport in a notice the following day.\n\nThe protests across the nation were sparked by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, where at least 10 people died, and videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. They joined a list of deaths that have been widely linked in public conversation to Covid-19 controls.\n\nExperts say the real test of the country’s direction remains to be seen in the coming months.\n\nIf the vaccination push and other proposed measures bolstering medical readiness were “seriously implemented,” then China would have “a way forward for future opening,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “But so far they have not been prioritized in the implementation process.”\n\nAnother problem is the disconnect between Beijing’s policies and how they are implemented by local government officials, who are under pressure to control case numbers for fear of being removed from their posts – a regular punishment in the past for those who have allowed outbreaks to spread.\n\n“If you open up and you mess up, then there will be trouble,” Huang said. “You have to change the incentive structure of the local governments before any meaningful changes can be introduced.”\n\nThis article has been updated with new information.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-023-00002-0', 'Headline': 'An equitable route forward from China’s ‘zero COVID’ policy - Nature', 'Snippet': ""Over the past 3 years, China’s ‘zero COVID' policy has contained numerous outbreaks and averted an estimated 1.5 million deaths across all socio-economic strata 1.The emergence of highly ..."", 'Full_text': ""Over the past 3 years, China’s ‘zero COVID' policy has contained numerous outbreaks and averted an estimated 1.5 million deaths across all socio-economic strata1. The emergence of highly transmissible Omicron variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that sustaining this policy is unfeasible, with mounting economic costs and growing public dissatisfaction2. In mid-November 2022, the National Health Commission released 20 measures toward gradual relaxation of the ‘zero COVID’ policy3. This was further streamlined to 10 measures in early December as the most substantial move so far toward living with the virus4. This included allowing home isolation for mild symptoms, dropping testing requirements for most venues and domestic travel, implementing targeted rather than large-scale lockdowns, and emphasizing the vaccination and boosting of people over 60 years of age. As China grapples with its largest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, these measures have largely been welcomed after 3 years of the most stringent control measures of any country.\n\nA pro-equity focus is needed alongside relaxed policies for COVID-19, given the disproportionate impact of the disease on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, which generally have lower vaccination rates5, especially as immunity wanes6. Socio-economic disadvantage lowers a person’s ability to adhere to measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, vaccination and self-isolation7. Factors related to this include inadequate health literacy, which may be positively associated with vaccine hesitancy; overcrowded living and working conditions; limited income to afford personal protective equipment; and limited benefits such as sick leave8.\n\nInvestment is needed to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on at-risk socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Access to high-quality healthcare services such as intensive care unit beds has been lacking, especially in the socio-economically deprived areas of central and Western China9, which could greatly reduce access to timely treatment. People on low incomes are often less aware of their chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) status and have less access to effective treatment for NCDs, which in turn places them at greater risk for COVID-19 sequelae10. Although the new COVID-19 measures have increased resources for treatment, ongoing limitations of health service availability in socio-economically deprived areas pose challenges for adequate treatment use. Furthermore, it is unclear if existing financial subsidies for covering out-of-pocket expenditure for COVID-19 treatment will be sustained, particularly as increasing cases of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 emerge. Ending these subsidies would pose financial risks for those on low incomes or with limited health coverage.\n\nWe believe that the following actions are critical to avoid reinforcing existing health inequities as China develops its new policy approach. First, accelerate universal vaccination, including highly effective booster shots, among the general population, focusing on outreach to older people in socio-economically deprived rural areas, where there is limited access to health services. Vaccination programs should target those working in industries that require frequent close contact with others, informal migrant workers, and those in dense living conditions. Second, promote universal masking in higher-risk settings, and continue access to affordable personal protective equipment and testing. This includes the direct provision or offer of subsidies to low-income households, as well as low-cost or free testing. Third, offer COVID-19 treatments to all, in order to prevent substantial mortality from COVID-19, particularly in at-risk communities. This could include mobilizing trained health personnel to provide treatment, including anti-viral agents and oxygen therapy, for people with severe COVID-19 in areas with limited healthcare services, during the winter months, when cases are likely to be higher. Fourth, collect socio-economic demographic data on routine health records. This would support the monitoring of health inequities, including those related to COVID-19, as well as facilitate targeted health interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nFifth, promote preventative behaviors, together with free primary health screening for NCDs, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are underlying risk factors for COVID-19. These measures are in line with the Healthy China 2030 plan, which emphasizes a life-course approach to NCD prevention and management. This could provide opportunities for promoting COVID-19 vaccination and risk reduction, as well as opportunities to strengthen the quality of care for NCD management. An ongoing commitment to investing in health infrastructure, capacity building and affordable NCD management in the most resource-limited regions of China would support equitable access to high-quality healthcare services, including those for COVID-19.\n\nShifting resources away from intensive ‘zero COVID’ measures and onto targeted public health interventions, with an emphasis on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, would be the most equitable way forward. As the mass migration of people for the Chinese New Year approaches, the time for drastic outreach is now.""}}",100.0,2

Hinds, MS, had the largest over-the-year percentage decrease in employment with a loss of 0.9 percent.\n\nAmong the 13 largest counties in Illinois, employment was highest in Cook County (2,504,100) in December 2021. Within Cook County’s private industry, health care and social assistance accounted for the largest employment. Together, the 13 largest Illinois counties accounted for 80.2 percent of total employment within the state. Nationwide, the 343 largest counties made up 72.4 percent of total U.S. employment.\n\nEmployment and wage levels (but not over-the-year changes) are also available for the 89 counties in Illinois with employment below 75,000.

For additional information about quarterly employment and wages data, please read the Technical Note or visit www.bls.gov/cew.\n\nEmployment and Wages Annual Averages Online features comprehensive information by detailed industry on establishments, employment, and wages for the nation and all states. This publication is typically published in September of the following year of the reference period or shortly after the QCEW first quarter full data update. The Employment and Wages Annual Averages Online is available at www.bls.gov/cew/publications/employment-and-wages-annual-averages/.\n\nThe County Employment and Wages release for first quarter 2022 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, August 24, 2022.\n\nThe County Employment and Wages full data update for first quarter 2022 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, September 7, 2022.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nAverage weekly wage data by county are compiled under the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program, also known as the ES-202 program. The data are derived from summaries of employment and total pay of workers covered by state and federal unemployment insurance (UI) legislation and provided by State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). The average weekly wage values are calculated by dividing quarterly total wages by the average of the three monthly employment levels of those covered by UI programs. The result is then divided by 13, the number of weeks in a quarter. It is to be noted, therefore, that over-the-year wage changes for geographic areas may reflect shifts in the composition of employment by industry, occupation, and such other factors as hours of work. Thus, wages may vary among counties, metropolitan areas, or states for reasons other than changes in the average wage level. Data for all states, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), counties, and the nation are available on the BLS web site at www.bls.gov/cew. However, data in QCEW press releases have been revised and may not match the data contained on the Bureau’s web site.\n\nQCEW data are not designed as a time series. QCEW data are simply the sums of individual establishment records reflecting the number of establishments that exist in a county or industry at a point in time. Establishments can move in or out of a county or industry for a number of reasons–some reflecting economic events, others reflecting administrative changes.\n\nThe preliminary QCEW data presented in this release may differ from data released by the individual states as well as from the data presented on the BLS web site. These potential differences result from the states’ continuing receipt, review and editing of UI data over time. On the other hand, differences between data in this release and the data found on the BLS web site are the result of adjustments made to improve over-the-year comparisons. Specifically, these adjustments account for administrative (noneconomic) changes such as a correction to a previously reported location or industry classification. Adjusting for these administrative changes allows users to more accurately assess changes of an economic nature (such as a firm moving from one county to another or changing its primary economic activity) over a 12-month period. Currently, adjusted data are available only from BLS press releases.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

Kansas ranks first on our list with 26 weeks of benefits and an average weekly payment of $375.\n\nWe examined each state’s benefits, excluding federal programs that were added on to state benefits due to the pandemic’s impact on the economy.\n\nAmong the states with the tightest purse strings, Florida came in last. The state offered just 12 weeks of unemployment during “normal times”—meaning without pandemic extensions from the federal government—with an average weekly payment of just $236. Most states offer between 20 and 26 weeks of benefits, although you may qualify for fewer weeks than the maximum in your state.\n\nUnemployment insurance is a social safety net you probably don’t think much about until you need it. But if the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything about employment security, it’s that unemployment benefits may not provide enough of a cushion if your financial world falls out from under you.\n\nThe Best and Worst States for Unemployment Benefits\n\nTo determine the best and worst states for unemployment benefits, Forbes Advisor analyzed the average weekly benefit, benefit length and cost of living index for each state and the District of Columbia in 2020.\n\nCost of living is typically calculated by comparing the costs of food, housing, utilities, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services. The higher the number, the more expensive it is to live in that state.\n\nFour of the top five states—Kansas, North Dakota, Wyoming and Texas—offered a maximum of 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. No. 5, Massachusetts, offered four more weeks but had a considerably higher cost of living than the other locations.\n\nThe bottom five states—California, Alaska, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida—had lower average weekly benefits relative to their cost of living.\n\nIt’s important to note that some states have benefit periods that can fluctuate depending on their unemployment rate. Utah, for example, offers just 10 weeks of benefits when unemployment is low; it increases to up to 26 weeks when unemployment is high.\n\nLooking at benefit weeks and cost of living provides a more complete picture of unemployment insurance in each state. But examining the top and bottom states based on average benefit payment reveals a lot about how that state structures its benefits.\n\nIf you look at the states with the highest average weekly unemployment payment, Massachusetts and Hawaii were nearly tied at just under $475 each. Massachusetts offered a whopping $855 per week as its maximum benefit, while Hawaii’s maximum payment was $648. These two states also have a high cost of living—Hawaii’s being the highest of all according to the Cost of Living Index from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.\n\nMeanwhile, Louisiana had an average weekly payment of $192 and a weekly maximum of just $247.\n\nIt may seem frustrating to see your state low on the ranking list, or at the bottom for weekly benefits. But generally, those amounts aren’t accidental—and it’s not solely about how generous your state is or isn’t.\n\nWhy Are States’ Unemployment Benefits So Different?\n\nEach state uses a different calculation to determine unemployment benefits. They each set the employment tax rate that funds unemployment insurance, along with payment amounts, length of time you can get benefits and requirements for eligibility.\n\nThe vast differences among the benefits states offer are intentional because in addition to cost of living variance, each state chooses how much of its residents’ income to insure, or replace.\n\nThe replacement rate—the portion of your old pay you’ll get each week on unemployment—can range from about 20% to about 55%. But why do some states push for more coverage while others push for less?\n\n“The maximum benefit differences between states reflect differences in visions for what unemployment insurance is for and who really needs it,” says Andrew Johnston, assistant professor of economics at the University of California at Merced. If your income is low—below about $30,000 annually—in any state, he explains, about half your weekly wages will be replaced by unemployment insurance. If your income is higher, the portion of your income that will be replaced goes down.\n\nWhy not just give people 100% of their old income? That could create a disincentive to work—meaning people may not want to look for a job. “States vary in how strongly they consider this disincentive to work and how large they consider this concern to be,” says Mallika Thomas, an economics fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Some of it is economics, and some is politics.”\n\nPolitics came into play, for example, when the U.S. Senate considered President Joe Biden’s March 2021 stimulus package, which included an extension of unemployment benefits. More liberal members of Congress were in favor of a larger federal supplement of $400 per week through summer 2021, while more conservative members favored a smaller supplement, arguing that the economy was recovering quickly enough for people to get back to work.\n\nBut even when people who were out of work received an additional $600 per week while unemployment was at its highest at the start of the pandemic, that money didn’t deter them from looking for new jobs, according to several studies.\n\n“I think some people see differences in state policy as a flaw,” Johnston says. “Differences are a feature, not a bug, of local control.” Allowing each state to determine its own unemployment insurance framework allows it to be more responsive to local and regional economic changes, he says.\n\nIt’s mostly up to each state to determine what it thinks is the best balance of providing for unemployed workers while also maintaining economic productivity that generates state revenue.\n\n“Local unemployment rates vary differently compared to the national unemployment rate,” Thomas says. “So there might be certain industries that are affected within states.” The nationwide unemployment rate could be far better or worse than in your town, Thomas says—and ideally, your state’s unemployment insurance program will account for these fluctuations.\n\nWhen the Pandemic Arrived, the Federal Government Stepped In\n\nWhen a nationwide economic emergency occurs, like the one created by the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government can step in to widen the safety net. More than 23 million people found themselves out of work in April 2020—the worst wave of unemployment in recent U.S. history.\n\nThe emergency was beyond a financial crisis. Public health was a concern, too. Not only were jobs in short supply, but workers also could quite literally be putting their health at risk by trying to find employment.\n\nMany low-wage workers found their incomes increased with the $600-per-week federal supplement authorized by the March 2021 stimulus law. The amount was added to the weekly benefit payment they received from their state. While that federal weekly boost shrank to $300 as the pandemic dragged on, it still replaced about 70% of the average workers’ income, according to an analysis by CNBC.\n\nAlthough the pandemic created exceptional circumstances, it made clear the gap between the state unemployment benefits you can expect to receive and what it will cost you to get by after a job loss.\n\nWhat to Do Before You Need Unemployment\n\nSince unemployment replaces only a portion of your wages, you can’t count on it to keep you afloat for very long if you lose your job.\n\nYour state may offer a tool to help you determine the amount of unemployment benefits you can receive. Massachusetts offers a calculator, while Kansas tells you how to do the math to estimate your benefit.\n\nYou can include potential unemployment benefits as part of a greater financial emergency plan. But you need to prepare to take on much of the burden of losing your income on your own.\n\nThat burden became especially clear during the pandemic, when many people struggled to access unemployment benefits despite being eligible for state and additional federal aid.\n\n“The pandemic era indicates that the traditional guidance of having three to six months of expenses saved is not enough,” says Jen Hemphill, an accredited financial counselor and the host of the “Her Dinero Matters” podcast. “But, it also revealed that people didn’t have much in savings in the first place.”\n\nIt may not be possible for you to sock away a year or more of expenses for an emergency, but Hemphill says now is the time to start focusing on building up your reserves.\n\nTake notes about what has worked, or not worked, for your household finances during the pandemic. For example, did your child care needs change? Did you have to buy equipment to work from home? Were you able to save money because you weren’t commuting, but found that your grocery bills increased?\n\nTaking an inventory of how you managed your money during the stressful time—regardless of whether you lost your job—can help you better prepare for your needs in the event of another financial emergency.\n\nAnd if you’re building or rebuilding your emergency fund, Hemphill says not to think about one big goal that can leave you feeling defeated before you begin. Instead, focus on the act of saving.\n\n“Build your financial confidence by focusing on achieving smaller steps first. You don’t have to do it all at once. Do what you can with what you have,” she says.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://iwcc.illinois.gov/resources/benefits.html', 'Headline': 'Benefit Rates - Resources - Illinois', 'Snippet': '06/30/2020. $836.69.

The data are derived from summaries of employment and total pay of workers covered by state and federal unemployment insurance (UI) legislation and provided by State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). The average weekly wage values are calculated by dividing quarterly total wages by the average of the three monthly employment levels of those covered by UI programs. The result is then divided by 13, the number of weeks in a quarter. It is to be noted, therefore, that over-the-year wage changes for geographic areas may reflect shifts in the composition of employment by industry, occupation, and such other factors as hours of work. Thus, wages may vary among counties, metropolitan areas, or states for reasons other than changes in the average wage level. Data for all states, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), counties, and the nation are available on the BLS web site at www.bls.gov/cew. However, data in QCEW press releases have been revised and may not match the data contained on the Bureau’s web site.\n\nQCEW data are not designed as a time series. QCEW data are simply the sums of individual establishment records reflecting the number of establishments that exist in a county or industry at a point in time. Establishments can move in or out of a county or industry for a number of reasons–some reflecting economic events, others reflecting administrative changes.\n\nThe preliminary QCEW data presented in this release may differ from data released by the individual states as well as from the data presented on the BLS web site. These potential differences result from the states’ continuing receipt, review and editing of UI data over time. On the other hand, differences between data in this release and the data found on the BLS web site are the result of adjustments made to improve over-the-year comparisons. Specifically, these adjustments account for administrative (noneconomic) changes such as a correction to a previously reported location or industry classification. Adjusting for these administrative changes allows users to more accurately assess changes of an economic nature (such as a firm moving from one county to another or changing its primary economic activity) over a 12-month period. Currently, adjusted data are available only from BLS press releases.\n\nFor more information see the Technical Note for the County Employment and Wages News Release.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

Your TTD rate is 2/3 of your average weekly wage (AWW) and is tax-free although there is a weekly maximum on how much you can be paid based on when you were hurt. Currently, that amount is over $1700 a week. Even if you aren’t missing time from work, your average weekly wage is used to help calculate your settlement at the end of the case.\n\nThe average weekly wage is calculated based on Section 10 of the Illinois Workers Compensation Act. In determining your AWW, the basic explanation is we look at your earnings from the prior 52 weeks from your injury. So if you’ve worked at a company for years and are salaried at $52,000 a year, it doesn’t take a genius to determine that your average weekly wage is $1,000.00 a week. If you are paid by the hour and consistently work 40 hours a week, a wage sheet would help in the calculation.\n\nSome people of course get hurt before they’ve been on the job for 52 weeks. In those cases, you divide by the actual weeks worked. So if you were hired 30 weeks ago, we’d divide by 30, not 52.\n\nIn a recent case I worked on with a lawyer friend from out of town, the injured worker is permanently disabled and is going to receive weekly payments for the rest of his life. He was hired about 10 weeks before his accident. His first workday was on a Thursday and he got hurt on a Tuesday. The insurance company took the first Thursday and Friday as one week and the Monday and Tuesday of the week he got hurt as another week. So they calculated his wages and divided by 10 weeks when in reality they should have done it by less than nine.\n\nThe difference amounts to over $70 a week, so over the last two years, he’s been underpaid by about $7,000.00. That’s item number one to look out for.\n\nThe second issue is that this job brought him along slowly. He didn’t work more than 35 hours during the first four weeks as there was some training involved. By week six he was doing the work that he was expected to which involved around 45 hours a week. Under Illinois law, when you’ve only been at the job a short while, your wages can be calculated by looking at a “similarly situated employee” and what they earn. There is no litmus test as to how many weeks’ time that is, but I’d argue that he was really only on the job for 4-5 weeks. So if they look at what a full-time employee working 45 hours a week makes, his actual AWW could be increased by over $200 a week. So he might be owed around $20,000.00. That’s a lot of money.\n\nWhat you can’t do, unless you are salaried, is take the insurance company at their word that you are being paid the right amount. You might be or they might be ripping you off. I promise you that they aren’t doing whatever they can to make sure you are getting the most you are entitled to under the law.\n\nIf you have any questions about your pay rate and want to talk to a lawyer for free about it, contact us any time at 312-346-5578.

The job openings rate nationally was 6.0 percent in February and 6.4 percent in January. (See table 3.) All data in this release are seasonally adjusted.\n\nThe ratio of unemployed persons per job opening in Illinois was 0.7 in February. Nationwide, 31 states and the District of Columbia had ratios in February that were lower than the national measure of 0.6 unemployed persons per job opening; 12 states had ratios that were higher than the national ratio, and 7 states had ratios equal to the national measure.

Over the 12 months ending in February, hires have averaged 255,000 per month and separations have averaged 218,000 per month. These averages include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year.\n\nAmong the February separations in Illinois, 130,000 were quits and 70,000 were layoffs and discharges, compared to 136,000 quits and 73,000 layoffs and discharges in January. (See chart 3.) Over the last 12 months, quits averaged 147,000 per month, ranging from 120,000 to 178,000.

The JOLTS program provides information on labor demand and turnover. The state estimates produced by JOLTS are model-based incorporating JOLTS sample, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), and Current Employment Statistics (CES) estimates. For more information see the JOLTS State Estimates Methodology.\n\nJob Openings. Job openings include all positions that are open on the last business day of the reference month. A job is open only if it meets all three of these conditions:\n\nA specific position exists and there is work available for that position.\n\nThe job could start within 30 days.\n\nThe employer is actively recruiting workers from outside the establishment to fill the position.\n\nThe number of unemployed persons per job opening is a ratio of the level of unemployed persons and the level of job openings. The number of unemployed persons at the national level is an estimate from the Current Population Survey (CPS), while state-level unemployment estimates are modeled by the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program. A ratio of 1.0 means there is a job available for every unemployed person. Lower ratios signal tighter labor markets, where firms have more job openings than there are unemployed persons available to work. Higher ratios indicate there are more unemployed persons competing for each job opening.\n\nHires. Hires include all additions to the payroll during the entire reference month.\n\nSeparations. Separations include all separations from the payroll during the entire reference month and is reported by type of separation: quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations.\n\nQuits include employees who left voluntarily, except for retirements or transfers to other locations.\n\nLayoffs and discharges include involuntary separations initiated by the employer.\n\nOther separations include retirements, transfers to other locations, separations due to employee disability, and deaths.\n\nLevels and rates of other separations represent a small portion of total separations and are not published with the release of state estimates.\n\nComplete definitions, including exclusions, and additional information about the State JOLTS data presented in this release are available in the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover Technical Note.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee.\n\nThose charges were for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the Jan. 6 congressional certification of electoral votes), obstruction an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct.\n\nHostetter, 58, opted to represent himself at trial. In a late November sentencing memo filed by prosecutors, the government began by quoting what the defendant said on Dec. 19, 2020, revealing his clear intent to breach the Capitol and demand lawmakers “fix this mess” — that is, the election outcome.\n\n“Choke that city off, fill it with patriots, and then those people behind the walls of the Senate and the House are gonna be listening to us chanting outside those walls. . . . And they’re gonna realize, we have one choice,” Hostetter said. “We either fix this mess and keep America America, or we become traitors, and those five million people outside the walls are gonna drag us out by our hair and tie us to a fucking lamp post. That’s their option.”\n\nOn Jan. 6, Hostetter had a “hatchet and other weapons” with him to participate in “an attack that was clearly calculated to influence and affect the conduct of the United States government and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nHostetter and co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty to obstruction in April, used Hostetter’s group the American Phoenix Project to “organize protests to the election results and to encourage violence.”\n\nHostetter, prosecutors said, saw pro-Donald Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood as “[b]ig names […] telling people to get angry, engage in civil disobedience, take to the streets.”\n\nIn October 2020, before the election was held, Hostetter was a “featured speaker” on behalf of the anti-COVID-19 restrictions American Phoenix Project at an Arizona conference “focused on the QAnon conspiracy theory,” prosecutors said.\n\nWhile on the one hand Hostetter declared “[n]obody wants violence,” he encouraged the crowd to keep the Civil War “in the back of your mind.”\n\n“We’ve never been as close to it as we are today since the Civil War. And you have to be thinking like that,” he said. “I’m all about peace, until somebody comes after my kids and my grandkids and says, ‘No, they’re gonna live under Communist rule. We’re gonna have Marxist school systems.”\n\nOne person who wore QAnon-themed clothes and shared posts about the conspiracy was Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed on Jan. 6 by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd after she stormed the building with an angry mob and tried jumping through a smashed window of a barricaded door near where lawmakers were hiding.\n\nThe shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Alan Hostetter from claiming Thursday that the shooting was a “psy-op” and that Ashli Babbitt is still alive.\n\nNBC News’ Ryan Reilly and CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane both noted that Babbitt’s mother was in the courtroom for the proceeding.\n\nAccording to Reilly, Babbitt’s mother was angry with Hostetter and said “I assure you she is dead” when leaving court.\n\n“What the f— is it you’re trying to say?” the mother reportedly asked.\n\n“Was she cremated?” Hostetter reportedly replied.\n\n“You need help,” Babbitt’s mother reportedly said back. “Arrogant s—.”\n\nHostetter will have some time to reflect more on the subject.\n\nJudge Lamberth ultimately sentenced the defendant to 135 months in prison (11.25 years). Before Lamberth handed that punishment down, Hostetter reportedly blamed Jan. 6 on Antifa, “crisis actors,” and government “false flags.”\n\n“The election was stolen,” Hostetter reportedly said. “I still have hope it’ll become known and be remedied.”\n\nAfter the judge sentenced him to be locked up for more than a decade, Hostetter walked out of court by himself.\n\nThe court docket shows that Hostetter has been allowed to voluntarily surrender to federal prison and, until that surrender, was permitted to travel between California and Texas.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Even so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents.

She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January.

We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process.

Associated Press, News Partner. Posted Tue, Jan 4, 2022 at 9:40 am ...', 'Full_text': ""Ashli Babbitt, who lived in San Diego, was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop.\n\nAs she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.\n\nTimothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019.

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016.

In a livestream from the protest captured by News2Share, a counterprotester heckled the demonstrators and blared the siren of her bullhorn. Witthoeft could be seen grabbing the bullhorn from her hand, pulling it away, and throwing it on the ground.\n\nThe counterprotester later reported the incident to police, who arrested her late Tuesday.\n\nWitthoeft’s arrest report indicates that the incident took place at 1801 E Street SE on May 29 at around 6:28 p.m. ET, and it was reported to police a little more than an hour later at 7:47 p.m. ET.\n\nThe report’s description of the incident is thin, and it says only that Witthoeft’s alleged victim reported being “assaulted” and “pushed” with an open hand.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Babbitt — motivated partly by her belief in QAnon conspiracy theories — joined a throng of pro-Donald Trump protesters at the Capitol. An Air Force veteran, Babbitt pushed to the barricaded doors of the Speaker’s Lobby, and she tried to climb through a broken window. She had been wearing a backpack then, and law enforcement warned rioters from entering the area. After Babbitt’s fatal shooting, a Capitol Police investigation cleared the officer who pulled the trigger of wrongdoing and commended him for protecting the Capitol.\n\n“The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away,” U.S. Capitol Police wrote in a statement nearly two years ago. “USCP Officers had barricaded the Speaker’s Lobby with furniture before a rioter shattered the glass door. If the doors were breached, the rioters would have immediate access to the House Chambers. The officer’s actions were consistent with the officer’s training and USCP policies and procedures.”\n\nWhen that investigation concluded in August 2021, authorities had not released the name of the officer who pulled the trigger, citing “numerous credible and specific threats” against him. His name had been leaked to far-right websites, and the lieutenant, who is Black, was barraged with racist abuse. He later went public and identified himself as Lt.

It stood to reason that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema would be actively involved in the elections, hitting the campaign trail and rallying support for her allies.\n\nBut she didn’t. Sinema kept a noticeably low profile in her home state, expressing apparent indifference to the outcomes of the critically important races. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego appeared on MSNBC after the elections, explaining, “We fought as a team in Arizona and we won. Sen. Sinema was nowhere to be found. At all.”\n\nA month later, the senator’s partisan passivity can be seen in a new light: Sinema didn’t seem to care about the Democratic Party, its candidates or its interests because she’s no longer an actual Democrat. The Arizona Republic reported this morning:\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema said Friday she is leaving the Democratic Party and will formally become an independent in a move that more fully places her at the center of a narrowly divided chamber. She announced her decision in an opinion piece published Friday in The Arizona Republic.\n\nSinema’s announcement makes her the first sitting senator to change party affiliations since Pennsylvania’s Arlen Specter switched from Republican to Democrat in 2009.\n\nToday’s news, however, isn’t quite as dramatic.\n\nSinema has left the Democratic Party and changed her affiliation to independent, but she’ll continue to caucus with Senate Democrats. She won’t be alone on that front: Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine are independents who’ve partnered with Democrats for many years.\n\nThe circumstances with Sinema will be a little different — she’s said she won’t attend caucus meetings, though of late, she’s generally skipped the gatherings anyway — but in her op-ed for the Republic, the senator suggested her policy positions and voting habits won’t change. She also expects to keep the same committee assignments — as chosen by Democratic leaders — that she currently enjoys.\n\nSinema added in an interview with Politico, “I don’t anticipate that anything will change about the Senate structure.”\n\nIn other words, as of 24 hours ago, Democrats looked forward to having what was effectively a 51-seat majority in the chamber. As of this morning, that remains largely unchanged.\n\nSo why bother? If Sinema is going to vote the same way as she’s always voted, and if she intends to remain effectively a part of the majority conference, why make a formal switch from Democrat to independent?\n\nThe answer is likely related to her 2024 prospects.\n\nTo put it mildly, Sinema has not endeared herself to Democrats in her home state. Earlier this year, Data For Progress polled Arizona Democrats and found the incumbent senator trailing Gallego in a hypothetical primary match-up, 74% to 16%. That’s not a typo: She actually trailed the popular congressman by 58 points.\n\nWith this in mind, Sinema very likely realized that she had a decision to make: She could (a) retire; (b) take steps to repair the relationship with the Democratic voters who elected her in the first place; or (c) take her chances as an independent.\n\nAs a tactical matter, settling on the third option makes sense. Sinema was very likely to lose a Democratic primary, her voting record made a run as a Republican implausible, and she didn’t want to walk away from Capitol Hill altogether. Becoming an independent is a sensible strategy.\n\nIndeed, it’s not unrealistic to think it might very well save her career. Democrats will likely think twice about running a candidate against her in 2024, fearing that splitting the center-left mainstream could leave the seat in Republican hands. Sinema’s announcement probably won’t dramatically alter the makeup of the Senate, but if it neutralizes an electoral threat, it’ll give the senator what she’s looking for: a re-election edge she wouldn’t otherwise have.\n\nBut as the political world digests the news, it’s also worth pausing to appreciate Sinema’s bizarre ideological trajectory. In the Bush/Cheney era, she was a liberal activist and failed Green Party candidate who railed against then-Sen. Joe Lieberman as a “pathetic” sellout.\n\nTwenty years later, Sinema has done exactly what Lieberman did: become an independent while caucusing with Senate Democrats.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.newsweek.com/kyrsten-sinema-tries-win-back-democrats-re-election-line-1765647', 'Headline': 'Kyrsten Sinema Tries To Win Back Democrats With Re-Election ... - Newsweek', 'Snippet': 'The Arizona senator has angered party colleagues by blocking several Biden proposals. ...

Kyrsten Sinema. ""If a two-way race is impossible to predict, this is exponentially harder to predict.""\n\nSinema first set the stage when she switched from being a Democrat to an independent late last year. While she called that choice a ""reflection of who I\'ve always been,"" the switch also prevented a primary fight with Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego -- and paved the way for something more unusual.\n\nSinema has not yet said if she plans on running for reelection. If she does jump in, she\'d ensure a race with three major candidates in a state where voters unaffiliated with the two major parties outnumber both Republicans and Democrats, complicating tidy assumptions about who would emerge the winner.\n\nState data shows just under 35% of Arizona voters are registered Republicans and 30% are registered Democrats, while 35% aren\'t registered with either.\n\nIf Sinema retires, the race to succeed her could instead feature Gallego, a Marine Corps vet and former House colleague of Sinema\'s who has become vocally critical of her, and Republican Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, election denier and 2022 gubernatorial candidate.\n\nBoth Gallego and Lake are more associated with their parties\' ideological flanks than the centrists who have historically won statewide.\n\n""It\'s gonna be like nothing we\'ve ever seen before in Arizona,"" said state GOP strategist Lorna Romero.

Sinema done,"" said Cesar Chavez, a former Democratic state lawmaker. ""The issues that Sen. Sinema ... has advocated for, and has been very successful in doing so, will definitely result in a positive tick in her numbers.""\n\n""I cannot stress this enough how deeply unpopular she is,"" countered Steve Slugocki, a senior adviser to Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a former chair of the Maricopa County Democratic Party. ""I traveled the state everywhere with Adrian last year. The first question was always, \'What are we going to do about Sinema? How can we replace her?\'""\n\nThose countervailing analyses are fueling a Democratic debate over the electoral paths for Sinema and Gallego.\n\nSinema\'s supporters point to independents\' registration advantage and say that her more moderate -- even unorthodox -- policy stances match a state where Democrats have had success in recent years even as the environment is far from solidly blue.\n\n""They say actions speak louder than words, and she has reached across the aisle probably more than anybody else I know in the entire Congress to forge solutions,"" said one former colleague, who asked not to be quoted by name. ""She can run on a platform of \'promises made, promises kept.\' And I think it\'s a very strong message.""\n\nOthers, however, say that most independents in fact vote for one major party or the other and that while she may keep true independents and take a chunk of moderate Republicans turned off by a GOP nominee like Lake, not enough Democrats would defect to vote for a third-party candidate -- aiding Gallego.\n\n""If [Gallego] can keep his Democrats, he\'s pretty solid, because if they lose 30% of Republicans on the R side, Ruben only loses 10%, well, he\'s probably gonna have more than everybody else at the end of the day,"" said nonpartisan pollster Mike Noble. ""Independents in the middle, they\'re not truly independent. One-third of them are Democrats, one-third are Republicans and one-third are actually true independents.""\n\nThe race will also likely feature an intense battle for support from Hispanic voters, an influential group in the southwest state.\n\nAll of this will play out in the larger context of the battle for the Senate, with the Democratic caucus (which includes three independents) holding a 51-49 majority but defending 23 seats in 2024, making operatives eager to avoid a spoiler candidate but without any agreement on who that would be.\n\n""She [Sinema] has shown she knows what it takes to win in Arizona. I look at these other candidates in both major parties, including my own, and I do not see proven winners,"" said LaBombard, one of her former aides. ""So yeah, as a Democrat, I\'m nervous because I want to keep Kari Lake out of the Senate.""\n\n""If she\'s in the race as an independent, Ruben\'s already at a disadvantage as a Democrat just because of the numbers that we have,"" said one former state lawmaker who is supporting Gallego. ""So, it comes down to a point of how many votes is Sen. Sinema going to take? Even if it is a very small percentage, any small percentage at all could tip this.""\n\nTo be sure, Democrats aren\'t the only ones wringing their hands.\n\nRepublican strategists told ABC News that a three-way race with a Democrat and an independent with a Democratic background would normally be a boon to the GOP candidate. But Lake is looming in the wings and is coming off a narrow loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs, which many observers attributed, in part, to her more hardline positions including her embrace of baseless claims of 2020 election fraud.\n\nA source familiar with Lake\'s thinking told ABC News they\'re confident she\'ll run for the Senate, likely launching a campaign in the fall. This person also confirmed that Lake recently met with several senators, including National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines of Montana, and that with her broad name recognition and support from conservative voters, she would enter the race as the overwhelming primary favorite.\n\nRepublican strategists agree with that assessment of the primary -- and the attendant risks in the general.\n\n""[T]he Sinema breakup from the Democratic Party looks good for Republicans on paper, theoretically. But I think that the big heartburn is what\'s going to happen out of a Republican primary, and are we just going to do the same ridiculous mistakes over and over again, and Democrats are just going to continue to win in the state,"" Romero said.\n\nStill, virtually every person who spoke to ABC News added the caveat that their analyses could end up being off given the unpredictable nature of a potential race with the incumbent running as the third-party candidate.\n\n""We\'ve never seen anything like that in Arizona,"" one Democratic strategist in the state said. ""I just think trying to predict anything right now, you might as well shake a Magic 8 Ball and see what it tells you.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/11/28/supreme-court-wont-protect-legislative-leaders-in-election-law-challenge/', 'Headline': ""Supreme Court won't protect legislative leaders in election law challenge"", 'Snippet': 'Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, shown here testifying in 2022, argued that he and House Speaker Ben Toma are protected from being deposed in a lawsuit challenging state election laws. But courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have rejected that argument. (File photo by Genesis Alvarado/Cronkite News)', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Monday denied a request from Republican legislative leaders who argued they cannot be forced to answer questions from voting rights groups challenging the 2022 passage of two Arizona election laws.\n\nArizona House Speaker Ben Toma and Senate President Warren Petersen said legislative privilege protects them from being deposed by opponents of the laws, which would make it easier for officials to cancel the registration of voters who cannot prove their citizenship.\n\nBut lower courts said Toma and Petersen waived that right when they joined the lawsuit to defend the laws, and the Supreme Court declined to intervene late Monday. It refused, without comment, their request for an emergency stay.\n\nLydia Guzman, who testified in the case for both Chicanos Por La Causa and the League of United Latin American Citizens, welcomed the high court’s order and said the lawmakers should have to face questions on why they passed the laws.\n\n“You know, coming from a Latino standpoint, I can guess as to what their intent is,” Guzman said Tuesday. “But I think it’s only fair that they say it.”\n\nIn their petition to the Supreme Court, Toma and Petersen urged the court to act before Tuesday, when they said they could be deposed in the case. Requests for comment from the leaders and their attorneys were not immediately returned Tuesday and it could not be determined if they have, in fact, been deposed.\n\nMonday’s order is the latest turn in a challenge that began one day after the first two election law was signed into effect by then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nEight separate challenges were filed by more than 20 plaintiffs, including the Justice Department, the national and state Democratic parties, Native American tribes, Hispanic, student and voting rights groups. They were consolidated into one case against the state and county recorders.\n\nThe lawsuits targeted HB 2492 and HB 2243.\n\nHB 2492 requires a person to provide proof of citizenship and their address before they can register to vote. If it is challenged, voters would have to go to a county recorder or the attorney general with proof of their citizenship.\n\nHB 2243 requires a county recorder to cancel the registration of voters if the recorder receives and confirms information that the person is not a U.S. citizen, is not an Arizona resident or has been issued a driver’s license or nonoperating license in another state.\n\nIn signing HB 2492 into law in March 2022, Ducey said that more than 11,600 Arizona voters had failed to provide evidence of citizenship since the 2020 elections. In a letter to then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Ducey said the state had a “proud history of making voting accessible” and that the bill aimed to provide election integrity.\n\n“Election integrity means counting every lawful vote and prohibiting any attempt to illegally cast a vote,” Ducey wrote. “H.B. 2492 is a balanced approach that honors Arizona’s history of making voting accessible without sacrificing security in our elections.”\n\nOpponents argue that the laws are racially motivated attempts to disenfranchise minority voters, in violation of federal law and the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.\n\nThen-Attorney General Mark Brnovich initially defended the law. But when Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, took office this year, Toma and Petersen asked to intervene in the case to make sure the laws were vigorously defended.\n\nAfter the two leaders joined the case, the plaintiffs sought to question them on the reasoning for passage of the laws that they said “make it harder to register to vote, harder to stay registered, and harder to cast a ballot.”\n\nToma and Petersen said they turned over more than 90,000 pages of documents along with written answers to some of the plaintiffs’ questions. But they declined to answer other questions about motives behind the law, saying that it infringed legislative privilege, which protects lawmakers from being sued for “legitimate legislative activity.”\n\nThe plaintiffs said they respect the privilege, but that Toma and Petersen waived it when they got involved in the suit and argued that there was no malicious intent behind the laws. They could have joined the case as friends of the court, but chose otherwise and now “have only themselves to blame for … being subjected to the same discovery to which every other party in civil litigation is subject,” their filing said.\n\nA federal district judge in Arizona agreed and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals eventually upheld that ruling on Nov. 17. The legislative leaders asked the Supreme Court to put the circuit court’s ruling on hold while they petitioned for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower courts to reverse a ruling.\n\nThe plaintiffs said the leaders’ petitions are little more than a delaying tactic in an effort to keep the laws in effect before the presidential primary set for March 2024.\n\nGuzman, who is the state director of LULAC, said Toma and Petersen should be subject to discovery.\n\n“Show us where this (the laws) came from, show us the intent, show us,” said Guzman. “I hope that with this discovery also comes looking at some of the emails, when they were drafting this.”\n\nAlex Gulotta, the state director of All Voting is Local Arizona, echoed Guzman’s message.\n\n“Legislators pass laws for inappropriate reasons,” Gulotta said in a statement. “The public deserves to know and the courts should consider those motives when trying to determine if those laws should be struck down.”'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/11/court-turns-down-request-for-relief-in-arizona-leaderships-voting-law-dispute/', 'Headline': 'Court turns down request for relief in Arizona leadership ... - SCOTUSblog', 'Snippet': 'The Supreme Court on Monday afternoon denied a request from the leaders of the Arizona legislature to put on hold an order that would require them to be deposed about the legislature’s enactment of voting laws that make it more difficult to register to vote.

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/mark-kelly-wins-senate-race-in-arizona', 'Headline': 'Mark Kelly wins Senate race in Arizona | PBS News', 'Snippet': 'Left: Democratic Sen.

In 2020, he won a 2020 special election by more than 2 percentage points over Republican incumbent Martha McSally.\n\nThere were some Republican activists in Arizona who advocated that voters intentionally wait until Election Day itself to drop off their ballots. Some of this push was based on unfounded theories that fraudsters could manipulate voting systems and rig results for Democrats, once they had seen how many GOP votes had been returned early.\n\nExperts had also warned that such a last-minute crush of ballots could end up creating delays that can ultimately be used by a bad actor to undermine confidence in the election. There were some hang ups this year. About a quarter of voting centers in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous, had a printing problem Tuesday, in which marks weren’t showing up correctly when voters showed up to print out their ballots. Officials said the problem was addressed within hours and everyone was able to vote.\n\nArizona has a long political history of voting Republican, but changing demographics have made the state friendlier to Democrats.\n\nWith Kelly’s victory, the Senate remained evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, with two races — in Nevada and Georgia — yet to be decided.\n\nWATCH: Vote counting continues in critical races to decide control of Congress\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote, Democrats can retain control of the Senate by winning either the Nevada race, which remains too early to call, or next month’s runoff in Georgia between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker.\n\nRepublicans now must win both those races to take the majority.

It gives Democrats 49 Senate seats, one short of securing a majority, with Nevada still counting votes and Georgia\'s contest headed to a Dec. 6 runoff.\n\nKelly ran as a moderate, breaking with President Joe Biden on issues like immigration as he sought to navigate headwinds generated by Biden’s low approval rating and widespread economic pain due to rising costs. He promised to protect abortion rights and build on Democrats’ achievements in recent years, including laws to boost competition with China and to lower prescription drug costs.\n\n“Thank you to the people of Arizona for re-electing me to the United States Senate,” Kelly said in a statement. “From day one, this campaign has been about the many Arizonans — Democrats, Independents, and Republicans — who believe in working together to tackle the significant challenges we face.”\n\nKelly carried moderates by a margin of 63% to 33% and independents by a margin of 55% to 39%, NBC News exit polls showed. Kelly won women by 12 points and lost men by 4 points. Kelly and Masters broke even with white voters but Kelly carried the state\'s large Latino electorate by 18 points, assuring his victory.\n\nMasters was weakened after fighting an ugly Republican primary, which he won with the financial backing of his former boss, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, then struggled to consolidate the party\'s base as he stumbled on issues like abortion. He sought to connect Kelly to Biden and blame the two Democrats for inflation.\n\nIn a statement Saturday morning, Masters said he wants to ""make sure that every legal vote is counted"" before conceding the race.\n\n""If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let\'s count the votes,"" Masters said.\n\nKelly had led in the polls for months as he showed his fundraising muscle and appealed to Arizona moderates. That steady lead prompted the biggest GOP Senate super PAC — Senate Leadership Fund, aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — to abandon the race in the closing months and focus on closer contests.\n\nInflation was the top issue for 36% of voters, and Masters won them by 40 points, exit polls found. Abortion was close behind as the top issue for 32% of voters, and Kelly dominated them by 84 points.\n\nMasters, alongside other GOP candidates atop the ballot in Arizona, promoted Trump’s false election claims, saying in an early campaign ad, “I think Trump won in 2020.” At a recent debate, Masters danced around the question of whether Biden legitimately won.\n\nArizona, once a Republican stronghold, had trended toward Democrats in recent years, narrowly voting for Biden in 2020 and electing Democratic senators in 2018 and 2020.\n\nKelly was elected in a 2020 special election. His victory gives him a full six-year term for the seat that Republican Sen. John McCain held for decades.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-rand-paul-senate-hearing-claims/', 'Headline': 'Fauci derides Rand Paul in Senate hearing as COVID cases ... - CBS News', 'Snippet': ""Fauci fires back at Rand Paul during heated exchange 02:40.

Paul used the clip to insinuate Fauci contradicted his position on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHowever, as Fauci and a Reuter’s fact check noted, the clip featured Fauci discussing the flu vaccine with someone who described having a reaction to it — Fauci was not voicing opposition to the vaccine for the general public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFauci announced last month that he will depart from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and as the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden by the end of the year.

The two often spoke over one another. Fauci accused Paul of attacking him to gain political points with swaths of people who have lost faith in the federal government’s handling of the pandemic.\n\n“Dr. Fauci, the idea that a government official like yourself would claim [that you] unilaterally represent science and that any criticism of you is criticism of science itself is quite dangerous,” Paul began. “Central planning, whether it be of the economy or of science, is risky because of the fallibility of the planner.”\n\nA testy Fauci blasted back, accusing Paul of politicizing the deadly virus.\n\n“You accuse me of, in a monolithic way, telling people what they need to do. Everything that I’ve said has been in support of the CDC guidelines: Wear a mask, get boosted,” Fauci said. “So I would like to make something clear to the committee. He’s doing this for political reasons.”\n\nFauci also cited threats made against his life and the lives of his family members, which Paul countered with examples of his own life being threatened over pandemic politics. Paul was also present at the 2017 baseball field shooting in Virginia when 24 Republicans practicing for a charity game were targeted by an attacker with a gun. This resulted in a shootout between the gunman and the Capitol Police. Senate Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was shot and had to undergo surgery.\n\n“It’s disappointing for you to suggest that people who dare to question you are responsible somehow for violent threats. Realize that by attacking me, you’re attacking the one member who actually has suffered from violent attacks,” Paul said. “We had over 160 rounds of semi-automatic weapons fired at us. … So for you to somehow suggest that somehow I or people who dare to oppose you are responsible for a threat, that’s insulting.”\n\nPaul and Fauci have engaged in such back-and-forth in past hearings to examine the administration’s response to COVID-19, which has a death toll approaching 840,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.\n\nFOUR HIGH-PROFILE DOCTORS WHO ARE CHALLENGING THE COVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nPaul also accused Fauci of refusing to acknowledge dissenting views about mitigation measures, including lockdowns.\n\nPaul cited support from the scientific community for the Great Barrington Declaration, an online petition written by three epidemiologists from Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Oxford. The scientists who supported the declaration, now numbering above 910,000, decried early lockdown policies as being too broad to do any good for the concentrated communities most vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly. Fauci and Collins were found to have called for a “devastating published takedown of its premises” after a Freedom of Information Act request exposed emails between them.\n\nPaul added: “A planner who believes he is the science leads to an arrogance that justifies in his mind using government resources to smear and to destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with them.”\n\nFauci, who held up a photo of a webpage from Paul’s site soliciting donations and calling for Fauci to be fired, said at the hearing that Paul was engaging in personal attacks against him and risking his safety.\n\n“We are here at a committee to look at a virus now that has killed almost 900,000 people, and the purpose of the committee was to try and get things out, how we can help to … the American public, and you keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance to reality,” Fauci said.\n\nUS BREAKS RECORDS ON COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND CASES\n\nFauci and Paul most recently clashed in a November hearing, when Paul pressed Fauci on a theory that the virus was created in and escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was performing a risky type of research on pathogens called “gain of function.” Some gain-of-function research, conducted on existing pathogens, has raised concerns over the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the virus. Fauci has maintained that the virus most likely arose in nature after mutating and replicating in animals before infecting humans.\n\n“It makes me very uncomfortable to have to say something, but he is egregiously incorrect in what he says,” Fauci said of Paul.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.newsweek.com/rand-paul-fauci-spar-over-vaccine-money-1716661', 'Headline': 'Rand Paul Spars With Fauci Over Money Tied to Vaccines', 'Snippet': ""Dr. Anthony Fauci and Senator Rand Paul sparred again during Thursday's Senate hearing.

""So you\'re not only distorting it, you are completely turning it around, as you usually do.""\n\nPaul said in a statement after the hearing, ""Anyone who dares to question Fauci’s smear campaign against other scientists is accused by Fauci of fomenting violence.""\n\n""As someone who actually was the target of semiautomatic gunfire by a Bernie Sanders supporter, I never once accused Senator Sanders of being responsible for the attack and I resent Fauci avoiding the question by ginning up the idea that his opponents are the cause of threats,"" Paul added.\n\nPaul was referring to a 2017 shooting when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and three other people were wounded after a gunman opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team as they were holding a practice in Alexandria, Va.\n\nIan Sams, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, said in a statement after the hearing: ""When it comes to misinformation, Republicans on the committee clearly weren\'t trying to stop the spread.\n\n""At a time when America is seeing rising COVID cases, it’s disappointing and frankly unacceptable that Republican Senators chose to spend a hearing with the country’s leading public health experts spreading conspiracy theories and lies about Dr. Fauci, rather than how we protect people from COVID-19,"" Sams said.\n\nPaul, a steadfast opponent of Covid mitigation measures and mask mandates, has clashed with Fauci before over other pandemic-related issues. Paul was the first senator known to have contracted the coronavirus when he tested positive in March 2020.\n\nIn July, Paul implied that Fauci had previously lied to Congress and was aware of what the lab in Wuhan, China, was doing with grant money that came from the NIH.\n\nTuesday\'s hearing also sparked a tense exchange between Fauci and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., about Fauci\'s financial disclosures and investments.\n\nAfter the back-and-forth, Fauci was heard on a hot mic saying: ""What a moron.

Paul previously called for Fauci’s resignation, while the White House advisor in turn has repeatedly accused the junior senator from Kentucky of misconstruing statements he’s made. On Tuesday, Fauci pointed to the number of death threats he’s received because of his work, and one incident in particular when a California man was arrested last month after allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent figures including Fauci and former President Barack Obama.\n\nContra\n\nSeveral Democratic senators came to the defense of Fauci following Paul’s comments, including Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). “We’re having a war against this virus. And just like in any wartime situation, mistakes have serious consequences,” he said to the panel, which also included CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and Acting Commissioner of the FDA Dr. Janet Woodcock. “But I appreciate more than I can say how much work you all have done.

Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) a “moron” during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. “Jesus Christ,” Fauci added.\n\nThe comments came after a heated exchanged in which Marshall blasted Fauci for concealing his financial disclosure, which is supposed to be public. The only issue, as Fauci pointed out, is that his financial disclosure is public. “You are totally incorrect,” said a flabbergasted Fauci.\n\nMarshall went after Fauci hard on Tuesday, but no lawmaker has attacked him as consistently and ardently as Rand Paul. The anti-vax senator from Kentucky has not only bashed the nation’s top infectious disease expert as an egomaniacal tyrant destroying America, but as someone who is responsible for the disease existing in the first place. Fauci during the hearing shed some light on why Paul might be spreading lies about him.\n\n“Why would a senator want to do this?” Fauci said. “Go to Rand Paul’s website, and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here. You can do $5, $10, $20, $100. So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”\n\nHere’s the full exchange:\n\nFauci exposing one of Paul’s motivations — if not his only motivation — in attacking him came during a heated exchange between the senator and the scientist. Such exchanges are now customary whenever Fauci appears before the Senate. He was particularly exasperated as ever on Tuesday given how Omicron is causing case rates to skyrocket. “We are here at a committee to look a virus now that has killed nearly 900,000 people,” Fauci said. “And the purpose of the committee was to try to get things out, how we can help the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me.”\n\nFauci eventually dropped the hammer, explaining that the harassment of his family and death threats against himself before recounting how a man who was arrested last month in Iowa was on his way from California to Washington, D.C., to kill Fauci and others. He wondered why a senator would tell lies to inspire such animosity against someone who is basically just sharing the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. The reason is because Paul thinks it’s good for him politically, and there’s no clearer proof than the billing his #FireFauci campaign gets on his website next to all those donation buttons.\n\nPaul has been one of the Republican Party’s most prolific superspreaders of Covid misinformation in addition to attacking Fauci. YouTube has removed several of Paul’s Covid videos for violating their policy on Covid misinformation, prompting Paul to announce earlier this year that he’s leaving the platform. A few days later, he essentially endorsed the Omicron, describing the variant as “nature’s vaccine” during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nAs Paul was badgering Fauci on Tuesday, the United States broke the record for people hospitalized with Covid.

Earlier this month, the NIH’s parent agency the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that ‘the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk’.\n\nWIV has been at the centre of unproven claims that the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic escaped from its labs. This latest development exacerbates the drama surrounding the US government’s support of coronavirus research in China prior to the outbreak.\n\nThe WIV research in question, originally awarded funding by the NIH in 2014 and renewed in 2019, was channelled through the New York-based non-profit EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth received approximately $600,000 (£467,000) for the project, which involved studying coronaviruses in bats and their potential to jump into humans. The project, which was cancelled in April 2020, was originally funded by the Obama administration. It had come under public attack from Republican politicians in the weeks preceding its termination.\n\nHHS does not argue that the project caused the Covid-19 outbreak, but it does criticise WIV for refusing to share certain information relating to its research.\n\nThe HHS memo, recently released by an oversight committee of the US House of Representatives, noted that the NIH determined in an August 2021 review that the WIV research may have yielded an increase in viral activity that violated the terms of the NIH grant. There was no evidence that EcoHealth had notified the NIH about this possibility as it was required to do, according to HHS.\n\n‘NIH has given WIV several opportunities to disprove this finding, but WIV has failed to do so,’ HHS stated. ‘Due to WIV’s disregard of the NIH’s requests … the NIH’s conclusion that WIV research likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.’\n\nEcoHealth contends that any increase in viral activity was ‘not statistically significant’, and argues that it had reported the results of its experiments in line with NIH’s requirements.\n\nIn a statement to Chemistry World, EcoHealth says that: ‘The [HHS] claim that there was no evidence that EHA notified NIH about the experiment in question is not correct. EcoHealth Alliance provided the Government Accountability Office with documentation regarding this alleged late reporting that showed the experimental results were first reported in the Year 4 report, which was submitted into the NIH system on time in April 2018, with a copy emailed to the NIAID Program Officer at that time.’\n\nEcoHealth had described the goal of the NIH-funded project as constructing Mers and Mers-like chimeric coronaviruses in order to understand the potential origins of Mers in bats.\n\nWhen NIH abruptly terminated the WIV research in 2020, there was worry that political pressure had motivated the decision. At the time, 77 US Nobel laureates and more than 30 scientific societies including the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology expressed concerns about the decision.

In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research. The NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, ... Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions.', 'Full_text': 'Researchers are upset over a new policy released by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tighten oversight of its ‘subawards’. These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/us/politics/funding-ban-wuhan-institute-virology.html', 'Headline': 'Biden Administration Moves to Ban Funding for Wuhan Lab', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration is taking steps to impose a 10-year ban on funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese research laboratory at the center of a heated debate over the origins ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration is taking steps to impose a 10-year ban on funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese research laboratory at the center of a heated debate over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a memo made public by a House subcommittee on Tuesday evening and an official familiar with the issue.\n\nThe memo, written by an official in the Department of Health and Human Services, said the institute had failed to comply with repeated requests from the National Institutes of Health for laboratory notebooks and other documents necessary to establish its safety practices.\n\nThe N.I.H.’s conclusion that the Wuhan institute “likely violated protocols of the N.I.H. regarding biosafety is undisputed,” wrote the official, whose name was redacted. The memo said that suspension of funding was necessary to “mitigate any potential public health risk,” and that there was “adequate evidence” to initiate “debarment proceedings.”\n\nThe institute, which has not received any federal money since 2020, now has 30 days to respond to the notice.\n\nThe memo was made public Tuesday by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic; its existence was first reported by Bloomberg. Republicans on the House panel have repeatedly asserted that the virus was the product of a laboratory leak, and have trained their attention on research conducted by the Wuhan Institute.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the pandemic, the Trump administration terminated a grant to EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that was collaborating with the institute to study bat coronaviruses in China.\n\nOfficials at the National Institutes of Health have repeatedly asserted — often in heated exchanges with congressional Republicans — that U.S. taxpayer dollars were not used in any laboratory research that could have produced the pandemic. But they have also acknowledged that they do not know what other research the Wuhan Institute was conducting.\n\nIn January, an internal watchdog agency found that N.I.H. had made significant errors in its oversight of the grants. The findings were outlined in a 64-page report describing missed deadlines, confusing protocols and misspent funds. The report reinforced concerns about the federal government’s system for monitoring research with potentially risky pathogens.\n\nEcoHealth’s grant was reinstated in May, but it does not provide funding for any research in China or with animals.'}}",96.875,2

""If a person wanted to be vaccinated, that person would have to go to the south. So drive around 15 to 20 hours crossing front lines in the mountains."" Even then, after such a treacherous journey through a war zone, it\'s not clear if doses would be available. Like many low-income countries, Yemen has struggled to get hold of vaccine.\n\nLoading...\n\n""Yemen has been one of the places with the lowest vaccination rates in the world,"" says Lavoie. ""And that\'s despite the fact that we\'ve experienced three waves of COVID."" Currently fewer than 2% of Yemenis are fully vaccinated.\n\nYemen is one of 36 countries that fall below the 10% immunization threshold, some with rates under 2%. Much of the mid-section of Africa is in that category, including powerful economic and political players like Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nBy contrast, many wealthy countries have fully vaccinated more than 80% of their citizens.\n\nWhy Africa lags so far behind\n\nMaaza Seyoum with the African Alliance, a South Africa-based advocacy group, says there are many factors playing in to the low vaccination rates in many countries on the continent but the biggest issue is simply that African nations have struggled to get doses.\n\n""Initially, 100 percent, I would say the problem was a lack of access (to vaccines) and a global system that did not prioritize African countries,"" Maaza says. Wealthy nations bought up far more pharmaceutical firms vaccine production than they could even use. The WHO-backed COVAX program faltered as it relied heavily on voluntary donations and on manufacturers in India who were blocked from exporting doses when COVID case numbers skyrocketed on the sub-continent. Some African countries managed to get supplies from China but Beijing often prioritized donations to wealthier trading partners.\n\nThat situation has changed, says Maaza. Recently vaccine deliveries to Africa have increased. But now there are new problems: the shipments are haphazard and sometimes consist of less popular brands that are about to expire.\n\n""Now we\'re seeing the sort of drip, drip, drip of vaccines,"" she says. ""People are waiting for vaccines to come. They come, then they stop.""\n\nThis unpredictable supply chain, she says, makes it nearly impossible for African countries to plan nationwide vaccination drives. And in some of these places where hardly anyone has gotten the jab, rumors about the mysterious vaccine have flourished and augmented vaccine hesitancy.\n\n""The truth is, there is vaccine hesitancy everywhere,"" Maaza says. ""But as people are waiting, it leaves kind of a fertile ground for these rumors to circulate.""\n\nWhich makes convincing people to come to a clinic and get immunized even more of a challenge.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat\'s behind those under 10% vaccination numbers\n\nThe World Health Organization set a goal of trying to push all countries to 40% vaccine coverage by the end of 2021. The 36 countries still under 10% obviously didn\'t even get close. Kate O\'Brien, the director of immunization and vaccines for the World Health Organization, says this is a significant problem.\n\n""For countries that are struggling to get even above 10%, what this means is that health-care workers are not fully vaccinated yet,"" she says. ""It means older age populations, those who have underlying medical conditions, the people at highest risk are not fully protected yet.""\n\nShe acknowledges vaccine supply inequity as a major part of why rates are so low in these three dozen countries but says there are other reasons too. Many of these countries had health systems that were struggling even before the pandemic to meet local medical needs. Some of them have needed to upgrade refrigeration systems to be able to store certain mRNA vaccines at extremely low temperatures. Others need syringes. All of this takes money that many low-income nations health ministries may not have.\n\n""A COVID vaccine campaign does require funding,"" O\'Brien says. Countries need money ""to deploy new health workers and to assure that the clinics have the resources that they need.""\n\nAnd while there has been some international assistance to lower-income nations to help, that financing has also at times been haphazard and unpredictable.\n\nOngoing conflicts present another obstacle\n\nAway from Africa, the other nations that haven\'t yet gotten above 10% COVID vaccine coverage are some of the most troubled in the world, including Yemen as well as Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nCurrently the armed conflict has displaced 4 million of 30 million Yemenis from their homes. Various groups control different parts of the country. According to the U.N. more than 2/3rds of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance. Yet international aid agencies have struggled to meet those needs and keep their operations running in the country due to the ongoing insecurity and a lack of funding.\n\nFor most people in Yemen, life is incredibly difficult. COVID vaccinations are ""not on the top of the list of priorities for many people in Yemen,"" Jasmin Lavoie with NRC says. He says most Yemenis spend their days trying to find food, shelter, decent toilets and worrying about whether they\'ll have to flee fighting once again. ""These are reasons why people are not getting vaccinated too,"" he adds.\n\nThere are similar issues in other conflict zones. ""In a place like Afghanistan, in a place like Syria, COVID is not their number one priority,"" says Paul Spiegel, who runs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSpiegel returned to Baltimore from working in Afghanistan in mid-December. ""[Vaccination] campaigns are happening,"" he says but adds that the immunization drives are constrained by the limited shipments of vaccine. ""A fair bit of it is Johnson and Johnson, which makes a lot of sense in Afghanistan situation because it\'s just one dose,"" he notes.\n\nBut similar to Yemen, the social upheaval in Afghanistan, with the U.S. departing and the Taliban returning to power, has pushed COVID to the backburner.

The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week.\n\nThe United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000.\n\nNew cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000.\n\nCases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier.\n\nAs dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported.\n\nIn the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections.\n\nSimilarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nSo far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic.\n\nA combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus.\n\nThe recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days.\n\n“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nCase rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.”\n\nThat group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nAlthough Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people.\n\n“Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html', 'Headline': 'Covid World Vaccination Tracker - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'More than 5.55 billion people worldwide have received a Covid-19 vaccine, equal to about 72.3 percent of the world population. ...

The main driver of this latest surge is the more infectious BA.2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant, which has been becoming more common ever since Christmas.\n\nIn the UK, increased social mixing and waning vaccine effectiveness – even in those who have had a booster dose – are contributing to this rise. But we’re also seeing huge spikes in areas that had previously kept themselves fairly COVID-free – New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Korea, for example.\n\nCase rates in these places are currently outstripping those seen in many European countries when they were at their worst, despite these newly struggling countries tending to follow rigorous zero COVID policies, with tight border controls and strict internal measures to limit infections. The highly infectious new variant having a bigger effect in places where restrictions are tighter. But why?\n\nZero cases equals delayed cases\n\nLong before COVID, it was known that non-pharmaceutical control measures – whether within a country or at its border – rarely stop a pandemic spreading. Usually, these things – lockdowns, quarantines and so on – only delay a disease’s spread. However, this may be sufficient to flatten the curve of infections and ease pressure on health services, or to reduce illness and death by delaying most infections until treatments have improved or vaccines become available.\n\nIn reality, the most influential disease-control factor is immunity, which can be generated by infection or vaccination. Both are important. As I pointed out last summer, the end of the pandemic in any country will likely depend on the proportion of people who have already had a COVID infection, and not just the proportion vaccinated.\n\nBreakthrough infections in those who are vaccinated will drive their immunity to a higher level, while in the unvaccinated an infection provides a level of protection that would otherwise have been absent. In fact, immunity following an infection now gives rather better protection against being infected in the future than immunity from a booster vaccine, especially once 90 days have passed since being vaccinated.\n\nThis helps to explain why some countries are now handling outbreaks better than others. In the UK, despite excellent vaccination coverage, the majority of people have also now caught COVID, and many people have caught COVID more than once. Cases are high for sure, but not as high as in some of these Pacific countries, and rates of death and severe disease are remaining at a relatively low level.\n\nIn comparison, countries that followed a zero COVID strategy are now seeing a larger surge in infections and deaths as they open up, even if they have high vaccine coverage. Their lack of prior infections means immunity across the population is lower.\n\nVaccines still making a difference\n\nBut despite the fact that both Hong Kong and New Zealand have both suffered huge rises in viral transmission recently, the impact on public health in the two places has been dramatically different.\n\nNew Zealand, with high vaccine coverage and a recent booster programme, is weathering this surge with far fewer deaths so far. Hong Kong has seen many more deaths, with a death rate per million people in the four weeks up to March 18 2022 that’s 38 times as great as in New Zealand.\n\nThe difference is down to the vaccination campaigns in these two places. In Hong Kong, at least up to the end of February, the uptake of the booster vaccine was much lower than in New Zealand, and was particularly low in older, more vulnerable age groups. Even second-dose coverage was low in these groups, meaning plenty were at a high risk of severe disease and death.\n\nDid the UK get it right?\n\nMy own country, the UK, decided to lift its remaining restrictions earlier this year, even though cases were still high when controls were eased and remain high now. Was this the right thing to do?\n\nThere’s no right answer, but given that non-pharmaceutical control measures only delay infections rather than prevent them, such measures should only continue if the benefits of delaying infections outweigh the more general harms to society and human health that come with restricting people’s freedoms. Given the high levels of immunity across the British population that have resulted from high case levels and good vaccine coverage, lifting controls made sense.\n\nThere’s also another important point to consider here. It’s been well publicised that the vaccines’ protective effect against catching the virus and developing symptoms wanes more quickly than protection against severe disease and death. However, there’s emerging evidence (still in preprint, so awaiting review by other scientists) that protection against severe disease also wanes with time.\n\nWhat this means is that delaying infections could result in people getting COVID at a later date when they are more susceptible to getting badly ill. This was predicted in some of the disease modelling of omicron published at the end of last year (also still in preprint). Imposing additional restrictions in December 2021 would have reduced COVID deaths in January 2022, but at the cost of increased deaths in March.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred to wait till the end of March to lift restrictions, so that we were into spring, when respiratory viruses spread less rapidly. That could have reduced the current NHS pressures stemming from staff absences.\n\nAnd finally, even though lifting controls made sense, today the UK still has a population of older or clinically vulnerable people who have not yet had the virus and whose vaccine immunity is waning. We must focus now on preventing these people from developing severe disease – perhaps through further vaccine boosters or use of antiviral drugs – rather than on attempting to reduce transmission in the general population.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01468-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'The big catch-up in immunisation coverage after the COVID ... - The Lancet', 'Snippet': 'The COVID-19 pandemic knocked countries off the trajectory towards vaccine and immunisation success by 2030, but the ongoing recovery shows that countries are taking action, partners are geared up, and that the goals and the vision of IA2030 are achievable. ...

From mid-April, focus shifted to the US, where the number of deaths has remained consistently high, although the focus of the epidemic has shifted from the northeast to other regions of the country. Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic in the summer of 2020, with the region accounting for almost a half of deaths each day. However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.\n\nWith several vaccines approved for use, the race is now on for countries to vaccinate their populations:\n\nThere are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that numbers of deaths in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.\n\nThere are several different ways of comparing excess deaths figures between countries. In absolute numbers, more people than would usually be expected have died in the in the US than in any of the other countries for which recent all-cause mortality data is available.\n\nAdjusting for typical mortality rates, the five hardest hit countries worldwide where data is available are all in Latin America.

As of 15 June 2022, 37 COVID-19 vaccines were in Phase 3 clinical trials, authorized for early use or approved for full use (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), with some available for use in infants as young as 6 months old1,2. Eleven vaccines have now been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO)3, and more than 11.9 billion (as of 15 June 2022, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL) COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered worldwide4,5,6. Nonetheless, more than 30% of the world population remains unvaccinated3, and COVID-19 vaccines and public health measures to promote them have generated substantial political controversy in many countries7.\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases will continue to play a critical role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future diseases, there is an enormous need to better understand both how governments use vaccines and the factors that drive or inhibit uptake. Within the latter, the policies and measures that governments adopt to promote vaccination play an important role. This resource article introduces a new dataset from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project8 that provides cross-national and longitudinal information on COVID-19 vaccination policies across the world. The new dataset covers vaccine prioritization policies (V1), vaccine availability and eligibility by group (V2), whether there is a cost to individual recipients at the point of use (V3) and mandate policies (V4) (Table 1). Developed in consultation with governments, policymakers, stakeholders in the field and the OxCGRT expert advisory board, this dataset allows researchers and policymakers to systematically compare government vaccination strategies and assess distributional capabilities (see Methods for more information on dataset design). Through combination with other datasets, further analyses, such as on the impact of distribution policies on uptake, are made possible.\n\nThe dataset is composed of four indicators that report national-level COVID-19 vaccination policies for 52 population categories from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 for 185 jurisdictions in the national database, as well as subnational jurisdictions (provinces) for Canada and (states) for the United States (subnational-jurisdiction data for other countries are in development and will be added to the online data repository as they become available). Collected by a specially trained team of OxCGRT volunteer data contributors, the dataset has been reviewed for quality assurance and accuracy by core OxCGRT researchers and a specially trained review team. The results presented here focus only on the national-level data. The 52 population categories include general and at-risk age groups (in 5-yr intervals for individuals over 16 yr), occupational categories (based on exposure and transmission risk and economic function—groups of people working in occupations critical to the economic function of the country, including essential workers and airport/border staff) and medical categories (based on vulnerability) (Table 2). These closely reflect the categories listed in the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, a framework that guides the allocation of vaccinations under limited supply to specific population groups to meet specific outcomes.\n\nHere we present some variations and temporal patterns of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization, eligibility, distribution, cost and mandates by group, with the aim of illustrating how the new dataset can offer insights for researchers and policymakers. By mapping variation in vaccination policies over time, this dataset provides a means of responding to critical questions about the role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic. The four indicators are presented in the dataset alongside vaccination rates so that users can easily generate cross-national and within-country comparisons to explore associations between vaccination policies, those prioritized for vaccination and vaccine uptake. The dataset’s jurisdiction–day format purposefully facilitates merging with other data sources. For example, combining these four vaccine policy indicators with data about other kinds of pandemic policies—relating to closures, economic support and health, such as testing—allows for assessment of the interplay of vaccination programmes within the broader context of pandemic management. Combining these data with other social science indicators broadens the possibilities further, towards considerations of the impacts of vaccination policies in different economic, political, cultural or religious contexts, and how controversies towards COVID-19 vaccines may have shaped policy. Comparisons between countries with similar demographics, or those with unique demographics and geography might highlight best practice for future pandemics10.\n\nTo motivate use of this new dataset, in this section we illustrate some initial observations using the four vaccine policy indicators. First, we focus on the first two indicators (V1 and V2). We note common patterns in vaccination prioritization strategies according to the broader strategies guiding countries’ pandemic management, and by country income level. We then observe country-level variation in both prioritization and actual distribution by age group and other kinds of vulnerability categories. Second, we consider the additional two indicators (V3 and V4), briefly discussing the cost of vaccination to individuals, before exploring vaccine mandate policies. Although we find limited variation relating to cost across countries—almost all countries provided the vaccine to people free of charge—we detail the diversity of countries’ vaccine mandate policies, ranging from non-existent, to policies specific to certain age groups, occupation groups and populations carrying out specific religious activities, or working in named locations.\n\nComparing countries’ prioritization plans\n\nThe vaccine prioritization (V1) indicator captures the order in which governments planned to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to different categories of people. It depicts the published plans of all countries in the OxCGRT dataset (only Eritrea, of 185 countries, has yet to begin COVID-19 vaccinations or publish a vaccination plan). These plans were primarily used to ration limited supplies at a time when global vaccine supply was constrained. As such, they help reveal the evolving priorities governments held for vaccine deployment.\n\nBroadly, we can distinguish two ideal typical COVID-19 strategies: elimination and mitigation. Roughly, studies have categorized these strategies by observing how eliminators aimed to keep the virus out of the country and to prevent community transmission. In contrast, mitigators sought to reduce the impact of community transmission by flattening the curve and reducing cases and deaths11,12,13,14. Many countries in the WHO West Pacific Region adopted policies closer to the elimination model, perhaps in part due to the region’s previous experience with SARS11,13. Relatedly, it has also been hypothesized that island nations may have been more likely to pursue elimination models during COVID-19 due to their geographical advantage of isolation and ability to seal national borders, although for many low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs, this came at appreciable economic cost11,15,16,17,18. Finally, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also highlighted distinctions between mitigation and elimination strategies based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as high-performing surveillance systems with early and targeted contact tracing and widespread efficient testing in eliminator countries12,14.\n\nInterestingly, we observe a clear distinction in the vaccination rollout strategies of countries that have been characterized as pursuing an elimination strategy throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to countries that pursued a mitigation strategy11,12,13,14,19. Table 3 highlights how nine selected eliminators (selected as examples from a comprehensive list of eliminators, see Supplementary Table 3), such as Australia and New Zealand, prioritized frontline workers and border staff alongside clinically vulnerable people (those with co-morbidities and/or predispositions to illness) in their first rounds of vaccination (that is, positioned rank 1), while nine selected mitigators (see Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of mitigators) focused instead on vaccinating only clinically vulnerable and elderly populations, along with healthcare workers. Looking across all countries in our dataset, while 11 out of 19 (58%) Western Pacific countries prioritized first-round vaccinations on the basis of economic function, only 42 out of 164 (26%) non-Western Pacific countries did so. When looking at the OECD subset, we observe the same pattern: 2 out of 5 countries that adopted elimination in the early stages of the pandemic (40%) prioritized vaccination on the basis of economic function versus 4 out of 32 (12%) mitigators. Finally, the same descriptive pattern holds for island nations (16 out of 32, 50%) when contrasted to non-island nations, with 16 (50%) island countries adopting economic function prioritized vaccination versus non-island countries (38 out of 151, 25%). In contrast, only 3 Western Pacific countries (16%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, versus 80 (49%) for countries outside the region. However, we observe no differences in descriptive patterns for either OECD or island country groupings. While 3 out of 5 OECD countries that adopted elimination strategies in the early stages of the pandemic (60%) prioritized clinically vulnerable people, 19 out of 32 mitigators did so. Finally, 44% of island (14 out of 32) and 46% of non-island countries (70 out of 151) prioritized clinically vulnerable people.\n\nWhen we map country differences in the most- (or equal-most-) prioritized categories of people (Fig. 1), we observe that almost all countries in our dataset placed healthcare workers among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines (91% of countries, or 168/185) presumably both to reduce transmission and mitigate health impacts for those at high risk of exposure. Following healthcare workers, 54% (101) of countries also prioritized populations deemed to be clinically vulnerable. Seventy-four countries (40%) prioritized groups of people critical to the economic function of the country, 45 prioritized (24%) categories related to the public function of the country, and 27 countries (15%) focused on educators and/or students for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nComparing countries’ plans with actual distribution\n\nBy the end of 2021, 62 (34%) countries had published COVID-19 vaccination rollout plans and prioritization lists, often with rough estimates for the timing of each phase. Of those, 48 countries began vaccination before the end of 2021 (Fig. 2), and by 31 March 2021, 107 more countries had published their COVID-19 vaccination plans and priorities. In countries with access to vaccines, deployment swiftly followed plans (captured by indicator V2, which records the groups actually receiving a vaccine in a country). Because vaccine access was highly related to countries’ income levels20, Fig. 2 groups countries according to the World Bank income classification groups for 2021 (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html). HICs were the first to publish vaccination plans to secure COVID-19 vaccines and to begin administration of vaccines for their populations, reflecting their greater ability to produce and purchase vaccines. Figure 2 shows that the publication of plans and subsequent administration of vaccine doses then followed in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), LMICs and then LICs, respectively. HICs moved quicker to expand vaccination eligibility to the 12+ yr age group than LMICs. It also shows that despite publishing plans and beginning vaccinations at later dates than HICs and UMICs, some LMICs and LICs quickly moved from prioritized vaccinations by age or occupation to universal access (defined in our dataset as being available widely to all those over the age of 16+ yr or 18+ yr, with age floor dependent on vaccine brand). LMICs and LICs have had far fewer vaccine doses available to them than HICs and UMICs (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/accessibility/), so one possible explanation for the swift movement towards universal access in LICs and LMICs may be an attempt to vaccinate larger proportions of their populations in the face of vaccine hesitancy. However, there are conflicting views on whether LMICs and LICs are more or less vaccine hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines than HICs and UMICs21,22,23. Another possible explanation for the quick move to (ostensibly) universal access (despite low vaccine supply) may have been to reduce public perception of favouring or excluding certain groups in the face of a public health emergency and with varying social and geographic challenges in the distribution of vaccines24,25.\n\nComparing categories by age and vulnerability status\n\nOnly 11 countries in our dataset did not specifically prioritize elderly populations (the age cut-off for ‘elderly’ is defined locally, see Methods) in their plans and rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Macau, Namibia, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Taiwan). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs; nursing homes, elderly care homes and so on) are a concept and cultural phenomenon predominantly found in some relatively wealthy countries26. This is reflected in our data (Fig. 3), with most African, South Asian and Middle East countries not prioritizing LTCFs in their plans and rollouts. In contrast, while not prioritizing its elderly population in general, Russia did prioritize vaccinations at LTCFs for elderly people before moving to universal eligibility.\n\nAt the younger end of the age scale, children and infants were not included in initial COVID-19 prioritization plans and indeed, the WHO stated that children were a lower priority group as they are less likely to experience serious symptoms27. Clinical research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children came later28. Because clinical trials split children into groups of young children (~5–11 yr,) and adolescents (~12–17 yr)29, many countries’ regulatory agencies approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in similar age groups at around the same time as research emerged and as vaccine supplies allowed (Fig. 2). Children 12 and above first became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on 6 May 2021 in the territory of Nunavut, Canada, and Bahrain made the COVID-19 vaccine available to children aged 3+ yr on 17 August 2021. As of 15 June 2022, only 12 countries were vaccinating infants (children aged 0–4 yr), 6 being Central and South American countries (Fig. 3), and 26 countries in our dataset have not been recorded as vaccinating children or infants (ages 0–15 yr).\n\nCountries prioritized many professional categories, some of which (for example, healthcare workers) were gendered to varying extents in different countries. Pregnant people were first made eligible for vaccinations in 2021. They were not initially prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to a lack of clinical trial data on the effect on unborn children and pregnant people. From January 2020 to 15 June 2022, 21 countries explicitly prioritized pregnant people in their official vaccination rollout plans (V1) (Fig. 4), and 54 out of 185 countries reported specifically administering vaccinations to pregnant people during their vaccination rollouts (V2).\n\nSimilarly, strikingly few countries have prioritized refugees, migrants and ethnic minorities in their COVID-19 vaccination plans or actual rollouts (Fig. 4), despite reports of disparities in the risk of COVID-19 infections and in health outcomes among these groups30,31,32,33,34. Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand all prioritized Indigenous populations in their plans and administration of COVID-19 vaccines (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Indigenous People, traditional riverine and quilombola communities in Brazil, First Nations in Canada, Māori and Pacific People and their extended families/whanau that care for them in New Zealand). In early June 2021, Greece began a vaccination programme specifically for refugees starting with the island refugee camps, then moving to the mainland camps. Some African countries with high rates of internal migration have prioritized the vaccination of migrants and ‘travellers’ (a term sometimes used for migrants) (Fig. 4)(https://africacenter.org/spotlight/african-migration-trends-to-watch-in-2022/). Many other countries may have made COVID-19 vaccines available to refugees and migrants but may not have explicitly noted this in official documentation.\n\nVaccine cost and mandates\n\nThe dataset reveals that nearly all countries provided the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to individuals at the point of delivery (V3). From data freely available online from government sources, we observed that Botswana, India, Pakistan and Turkmenistan required a small fee for COVID-19 vaccination from individuals, in some circumstances. In Taiwan, vaccines were free for those meeting eligibility criteria, but individuals could self-fund vaccination in advance of becoming eligible for free vaccines. Some countries enabled individuals to acquire the vaccination privately if they wished or encouraged vaccine tourism in efforts to boost tourism during the pandemic. In late 2021, Russian tourists were accessing free non-Sputnik vaccines in Croatia via specially arranged tours35. Not long after, Russia began to offer their Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine at a cost to tourists (although visas to visit the country were an issue for some)36. Cities and states of the United States, Indonesia, Cuba, the Maldives and the UAE began to use free COVID-19 vaccinations to increase tourism, and travel agencies in the United Kingdom, India and the United States (among others) offered package deals for individuals not yet eligible in their own country to access the vaccine in another37,38,39. These cases are not recorded in our V3 ordinal indicator data but are captured in qualitative coding notes within the dataset.\n\nWe define mandatory COVID-19 vaccination as a government policy requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific age group of citizens to be vaccinated. We see these policies as distinct from COVID-19 passports or certification to gain entry to non-essential services or for international travel based on demonstrating immunity or negative test results. These ‘passport’ style policies are defined in the OxCGRT database as ‘differentiated policies’ and are part of the OxCGRT Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) dataset8,40. For 10 of these original indicators, we report two policies, one for vaccinated and another for non-vaccinated individuals, viewing requirements to present passes as a de facto closure (see online documentation and Methods for further detail).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates (V4) were first introduced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2021 for all adults41. As of 15 June 2022, 55 countries (29%) of our dataset have currently, or had at one time, at least one vaccine mandate policy. Figure 5 shows that mandatory vaccination policies accelerated in implementation around July 2021, commonly according to occupation (83%), with age-based mandates being far less widespread (17%).\n\nThe most common groups to have been mandated for COVID-19 vaccination were related to occupation: government officials (36), healthcare workers (29), staff at LTCFs (15) and educators (22). Hence, in most countries, mandates only affected a small and specific proportion of the population, as opposed to COVID-19 passports which affected the whole population to control their access to services. Six countries (Germany, Ethiopia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Russia and Tonga) mandated vaccines for socially vulnerable and or other vulnerable populations (see Table 2). Nine countries, including Indonesia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the entire adult population. Ecuador mandated vaccination for all those over 5 yr and in Costa Rica, all those aged 3–18 yr must be vaccinated (""×"" symbol in Fig. 5). The qualitative notes section of this new vaccine dataset records how some countries introduced specific vaccine mandates for particular groups relevant to their local context, such as those observing the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Jahh in Bangladesh, and maritime and port workers in Singapore.\n\nIn this section we describe the design, structure, collection, publication and review of the panel dataset of COVID-19 vaccine policies, with the jurisdiction–day as the unit of analysis. All OxCGRT data are available on GitHub and are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY standard. Data users should refer to the project website for updated documentation and methodologies (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker). Excel (v.16), Stata (v.17.0) and R (v.4.1.3) software were used for all analysis and images produced in this resource article.\n\nIndicators\n\nIn late 2020, the OxCGRT team began to consider the COVID-19 vaccine policies and strategies that might be deployed globally. Extensive consultations with government officials, policymakers, experts and stakeholders in the relevant fields, consideration of critical gaps in existing data at the time, and capacity to collect such information resulted in a focus on four priority policies to measure (vaccine indicators V1–V4): who was prioritized for vaccines, who was eligible and receiving vaccines and in what order, who was paying for vaccines, and who was mandated to be vaccinated. Additional indicators for future consideration could include which vaccines were approved/deployed in each country, prioritization for additional/booster vaccinations, vaccine dose timing (manufacturer recommendations vs timeline chosen by country for subsequent doses), government vaccination incentives, vaccination education strategies/programmes and internal vs external funding for vaccines.\n\nVaccine prioritization (V1) records the ranked position for different groups within a country’s prioritization plan. This is the official plan of the official order in which categories are to be vaccinated. This is recorded regardless of whether a country has capacity to distribute and administer vaccines. Vaccination eligibility/availability (V2) is a categorical/binary variable that records which categories of people, regardless of their position in a prioritized rollout plan, are currently receiving vaccinations. This is recorded as a non-zero value if there is evidence that people in this category are being vaccinated, whether this is happening in a targeted geographical region or nationwide. There must be de facto evidence that this is happening to record a non-zero value in V2. For ‘elderly’ groups, we used local elderly age definitions using qualitative notes where available. In the absence of local guidance on elderly age range, a default of 65+ yr was used. Vaccine financial support (V3) is recorded on an ordinal scale. It reports how vaccines are funded for each category selected in V2 as currently receiving vaccination (1 for full cost to individual, 2 for partially funded by government, 3 for fully funded by government/free). Mandatory vaccination (V4) is a binary variable which reports the existence of a requirement for a category of people to be vaccinated. These are government policy requirements to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in a specific occupation, or for a specific group to be vaccinated. This is a mandatory vaccination required as part of occupation or citizenship, and we do not record policies that only ‘encourage’ voluntary vaccination to access non-essential services, facilities or freedoms. For example, if healthcare workers must be vaccinated to attend their place of work, this is recorded in V4. As detailed in our interpretation guidance, if there is a vaccine mandate in place for workers of certain occupations, and non-vaccinated people in this occupation have the option of testing regularly to opt out of vaccination, we still record this as a mandate in V4. If vaccination is mandatory in a subnational region as a result of an official national or local government policy, we record this in V4. We do not report enforcement of vaccine mandates, just the policy.\n\nThe vaccination policy dataset also contains summary indicators. These use an ordinal scale to report one number per indicator to offer a succinct summary on the basis of data entered for variables in the main V1–V4 dataset. These are summarized in our codebook (see Supplementary Information). V2, V3 and V4 policies are reported as non-zero values on the date when the policy came into effect, as opposed to the date they were announced. We report the V1 government rollout prioritization plan on the date the policy was published. For the analysis in this paper, the detailed qualitative notes section was used to manually find specific age floors for when different ages became eligible for vaccination, rather than using the age ranges in the quantitative data due to the limitations described above.\n\nIn March 2022, the OxCGRT NPI dataset and data structure was altered to reflect the different policies for unvaccinated and vaccinated people (for COVID-19), where passes or proof of either negative testing or vaccination were required to access different areas of public life (https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-scratchpad/tree/master/differentiated_vaccination_policies). For ten indicators (C1–8, H6 and H8), both the policy values for non-vaccinated and vaccinated people are reported if there are different policies in place. If there is no differentiation, one value is reported. These differentiated values relate only to ‘voluntary access’ to elements of public life, such as attending large events or entertainment and dining venues, which are controlled by testing, evidence of previous immunity or vaccination status through a form of certification or proof.\n\nIt is valuable to record both mandatory vaccine policies and voluntary vaccine pass/passport policies. This differentiated coding is reported in our NPI dataset with ‘V’ and ‘NV’ designations (for example, ‘C1V_School closing’ and C1NV_School closing’) and is distinct from the ‘V4 - mandatory vaccination’ indicator reported in this paper.\n\nData collection\n\nWe collected and published data on publicly available sources, which are freely available through internet searches. These are found on government websites, policy briefs and reputable news outlets. The best-quality sources are original policy documents and high-quality media outlets. These sources are codified into the OxCGRT data protocol and entered into the database. A detailed qualitative note (written in English) and web-archived source are provided for context.\n\nThe V1–V4 data for the national dataset were initially collected by OxCGRT researchers and a small group of experienced and specially trained volunteer data collectors who received specific training. As of 1 January 2022, data collection for V1–V4 was integrated into the core OxCGRT data collection process, which involves an international team of hundreds of volunteer data collectors covering 90+ unique languages. Where language was a barrier, and where English sources could not be found, local speakers from the pool of OxCGRT contributors were consulted, or translation tools such as Google Translate were utilized. The majority of data collectors are/were postgraduate students at universities around the world. Each data collector completed a bespoke online e-learning course, which took around 45 min to complete, covering the V1–V4 indicators, key coding interpretation points and data quality. Every week of data collection was reviewed by a member of the OxCGRT team for quality and accuracy, and was further reviewed by a trained V1–V4 specific volunteer reviewer (also trained via a bespoke reviewer training e-learning course) and confirmed in the database over the medium to longer term. On GitHub, we published both a codebook and an interpretation guide to standardize interpretation and ensure that all coders were making the same logical choices for data entry. We also published a ‘best fit’ table which records where categories have been substituted when there is a category announced in a policy that is not listed in V1/2, ensuring the standardization of ‘best fit’ interpretation (Supplementary Table 4). This highlights the importance of the ‘notes’ function for each indicator, enabling an in-depth qualitative analysis of the data beyond the numerical summaries. Qualitative notes in our comma-separated values files (CSVs) can be used to find archived original policy documents and specific groups prioritized in each country if a best fit has been used.\n\nData publication and summary indicators\n\nThe data are published in a standalone ‘Vaccines_full.csv’ on GitHub, which includes all the 52 categories for V1–V4. They are also summarized in 9 summary indicators, which report one single number for V1 (vaccination prioritization), V2 (vaccination eligibility/availability) categories (overall summary, general population age floor, at-risk age floor, medically clinically vulnerable (non-elderly), education, frontline workers (non-healthcare), frontline workers (healthcare)) and V3. These summary indicators are included in most of our data CSVs on GitHub, including the NPI dataset ‘OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv’. The data are published in real time and updated each week by the team of international data collectors.\n\nIndependent data quality check\n\nWe conducted a data quality and accuracy check, where two core team researchers checked the data and original source material for 100 randomly selected data entry points, focusing on the period of time when the majority of new policies and policy changes were being made, and during which the majority of data were entered for all four vaccination policy indicators. The researchers independently verified that 90% of the original data entries in the database were correct, by analysing original source material and checking this alongside the database entries. The remaining 10 entries were corrected. Specifics such as date of announcement vs date of policy effect, accuracy of selected groups and ages, and ensuring that any recorded mandates were in fact government mandates were among the various checks in this independent data quality review process.\n\nAs part of the weekly data update cycle, a small team of specially trained reviewers are tasked with checking and confirming data entered. As part of this review process, changes to the data are made retroactively, meaning values on past dates may change. As a result, we recommend downloading the most recent data and stating the download date when using them for analysis. The data used for this paper up to 15 June 2022 have been checked thoroughly by the authors. On the rare occasion where data could not be verified or confirmed by local sources, or via translation, they were not included. An unintentional consequence of this is that a group that was prioritized/eligible/mandated to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may not have been captured by our dataset.\n\nComparison to other data sources\n\nWe do not know of any other datasets publishing systematic data on COVID-19 vaccine policies. This unique source therefore adds considerable value to other datasets. For example, the Reuters COVID-19 vaccination tracker, although no longer updating data, reported the prioritization plan (similar to V1 - vaccine prioritization), availability and eligibility (similar to V2 - vaccination eligibility/availability) of different groups for vaccination in each country, although this does not provide the original archived source material, dates or a time series dataset to evidence when groups became eligible (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/). The Africa CDC Vaccine Dashboard also reports the date vaccination campaign commenced (similar to V2) in African nations, although it does not provide original archived source material, or state when which groups began to receive vaccines (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/). Coronanet includes questions on the number of priority groups for vaccine distribution (similar to V1) but only through 2021 (https://www.coronanet-project.org/assets/CoronaNet_Codebook.pdf).\n\nVaccine policy data are particularly useful when combined with information on the number of vaccine doses administered. For example, the OxCGRT vaccine policy data are displayed as part of Our World in Data’s COVID-19 vaccinations website resource3, which combines country-specific vaccination data into a single resource. Our data can be compared to variables such as proportion of the population that has received one dose, vaccination uptake rates and number of doses administered, to consider the effects of vaccination policies on these. Our H7 indicator, which is a summary of our V2 vaccination policy indicator, is also displayed here. The data are also used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WHO’s Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/), demonstrating their value in informing an interactive accessible tool to reflect the data on the COVID-19 rollout to ensure equitable access.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}}",99.0,2
