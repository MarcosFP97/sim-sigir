In a 6-3 order, the justices blocked an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) emergency rule for businesses with more than 100 employees — one that would have impacted more than 80 million workers.\n\nThe justices did, however, allow a vaccination mandate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for health-care workers at some 76,000 federally funded facilities to stand.\n\n“Today’s decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the requirement for health care workers will save lives: the lives of patients who weeks care in medical facilities, as well as the lives of doctors, nurses, and others who work there,” Biden said. “At the same time, I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense, life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and law.”\n\nOSHA had estimated that the ruling for large businesses would have saved more than 6,500 lives and prevented 250,000 hospitalizations in the next six months.\n\nMichelle Mello, a professor of health policy in the School of Medicine’s Department of Health Policy and professor of law at Stanford Law, explains the legal and health implications of the two rulings. William B. Gould, a professor (emeritus) who specializes in labor law at Stanford Law, takes a deep look at the OSHA regulations.\n\nThough they struck down the mandate for large companies, they allowed the more limited one requiring health-care workers at federally funded facilities to be vaccinated. Don’t some of those large companies also receive federal funding or tax breaks and subsidies? Or is it that comparing apples to oranges?\n\nMello: These seem like similar situations: both cases involved agencies flexing their muscle to require the organizations they regulate to do something, and both turned on the Supreme Court’s reading of how broad a grant of power Congress intended to give the agencies. But legally, that’s where the similarity ends. The legal authorities marshaled to impose the mandates were quite different.\n\nIn the case involving the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS’s) rule that workers in health-care facilities get vaccinated, the agency was acting through its authority to impose conditions on facilities’ participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If you’re a hospital and you want to bill these programs for services you provide to beneficiaries, you must do a lot of things to prove you’re set up to provide safe care. The description Congress gave of what CMS can require as a condition of participation is broad, and CMS has long required other things to prevent transmissions of communicable diseases and infections.\n\nIn the case involving the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA’s) rule that large employers ensure that their employees are either vaccinated or get tested regularly, the agency was using its authority under a statute called the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to regulate workplace safety. The scope of OSHA’s authority under this law doesn’t have anything to do with whether the employer gets federal funding or not (the Biden Administration imposed a separate rule for employers, like Stanford University, that are federal contractors). And a majority of the Supreme Court justices read OSHA’s authority under that statute as really quite narrow.\n\nSo why didn’t the Court find that this was a workplace safety issue that OSHA could address with a vax-or-test requirement?\n\nMello: Basically, the majority said Congress only intended to give OSHA the power to address hazards that are confined to the workplace setting. They distinguished COVID as being in the category of “day-to-day dangers that all face,” likening it to risks like crime and air pollution. They were willing to acknowledge that some workplaces might have such an elevated risk of COVID transmission as to make COVID an occupational hazard (for example, labs working with the virus, or highly crowded, cramped environments), but said OSHA’s rule swept in nearly all workplaces — and so went much too far.\n\nWhat’s driving the majority’s stance is concern that unelected officials are making decisions with sweeping implications — decisions that in our democratic system must rest with more accountable officials. In other words, if Congress wants to do something this big, it needs to do it directly or state very clearly that an agency is allowed to do it.\n\nThe three dissenters in the case don’t disagree with that principle, but think the majority engaged in some contorted thinking to reach the conclusion that Congress didn’t give OSHA the authority to address COVID. They point out that the statute makes no distinction between hazards that are confined to the workplace and those that also exist outside it. Fires and unsafe drinking water are also hazards workers may encounter off the job, for example, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still fall within OSHA’s purview. And, they note, OSHA’s rule does exempt workplaces where the risk of COVID transmission is low, so it’s not overbroad.\n\nHas OSHA issued mandates like this before?\n\nGould: This is not the first time that OSHA has ventured into this realm. It has undertaken three major initiatives in the past. One was at the time of the HIV crisis when it provided for regulation of so-called blood pathogens, with regard to HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. It also provided rules, which have, for example, imposed requirements for employers to allow workers to have their own drinking cups and drinking facility so that they don’t share with one another and don’t promote the possibility of infectious disease. That was done in construction. And in the area of agriculture, they also devised rules designed to protect workers against dust and heat.\n\nWhat these rules all have in common, including the one that the Court just struck down, is that they deal with the problems of infectious diseases and they deal with problems that arise both out of the workplace and in the workplace. I mention that because in the discussion and the oral argument, and during the Trump administration that preceded the Biden administration, much of the attention was focused upon what is unique to the workplace—and that OSHA only had jurisdiction in that area.\n\n“Underlying everything else in this dispute is a single, simple question: Who decides how much protection, and of what kind, American workers need from Covid-19?” the three justices who believed the mandate should have been upheld said in their dissent. “An agency with expertise in workplace health and safety, acting as Congress and the president authorized? Or a court, lacking any knowledge of how to safeguard workplaces, and insulated from responsibility for any damage it causes?”\n\nIs this the crux of the case? Does OSHA have the right to mandate such regulations?\n\nMello: It’s right to say that the core issue here is: Who decides? Indeed, three of the conservative justices framed it in the same way: “The question before us is not how to respond to the pandemic, but who holds the power to do so. …[T]hat power rests with the States and Congress, not OSHA.”\n\nBut I think it’s also fair to call out the justices in the majority for usurping the roles of both Congress and OSHA through their bizarre reading of the statute. Most people will find it surprising that (even as they don masks to hear oral arguments) these justices don’t consider COVID a workplace hazard. Most members of Congress will as well, I suspect! After all, Congress has already instructed OSHA to do other things to fight COVID in the workplace.\n\nGould: I think that OSHA has the authority to do it. This is the first time, however, that OSHA has been presented with a problem quite like this. A wide variety of arguments have been put forward to say that OSHA does not have the authority. Chief Justice Roberts noted in oral argument that this problem didn’t exist in 1970 when the statute was passed. Well, of course, we know that all kinds of problems don’t exist at the time when statutes are passed. That’s why we have to have agencies and courts and lawyers and law professors to address changing circumstances—acknowledging that we have new problems that pose new challenges to statutory interpretation.\n\nHow much of a setback is this for the national efforts to get to the other side of this pandemic? If the court had ruled the other way, would the mandates/testing really have made a difference considering one-third of the country are adamantly opposed to vaccines?\n\nMello: It’s definitely a setback. We don’t yet have data on the effect of employer mandates from systematic studies, but reports have been accumulating from different companies showing high levels of compliance. There are certainly some people who will quit their jobs to seek employment in companies not subject to mandates. But many others, at the end of the day, are willing to go along if their jobs are at stake. A national poll conducted in November 2021 found that among the unvaccinated, a little over half said they would “definitely not” get the vaccine but the remainder were more open to it.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Court’s opinion doesn’t say employees can’t be required to take the vaccine. It just says OSHA can’t require it under this particular statute. Congress can require it, or states can require it for worksites within their borders. In many states, cities and counties could as well. And in most states, employers can choose it require it on their own. I would expect some of these actors will step in to fill the vacuum left by the Court’s decision.\n\nAren’t big companies regulating for themselves anyway?\n\nGould: You know, Tyson has negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with United Food and Commercial Workers imposing vaccination, as has AT&T, Boeing, and a number of major companies. So large companies in the fortune 500 have gone ahead on their own to require vaccinations. The Houston Medical Hospital, where the first round of litigation took place, also imposed vaccination—and were exhibit number one in the argument for OSHA because very few people resigned because of the requirement of vaccination.\n\nSo that’s the big concern for employers—that staff will resign if forced to vaccinate?\n\nGould: Oh yes. And that looms large, at least in the appendices and the exhibits that have been filed in these cases…that we’re not going to be able to function effectively because we’re going to lose our workers. But I don’t think many of the big companies filed amici. That’s the position of the states that are hostile to President Biden, and about half the states of the Union signed on to a brief challenging this rule.\n\nSo, one of the reasons the employers are so worried about vaccine mandates is that they are afraid of losing workers and that fits into a bigger trend going on during the pandemic, doesn’t it? With respect to what people are calling the great resignation, where people are reportedly leaving their jobs in large numbers. What do you make of that?\n\nGould: Well, I think that the great resignation, as it has come to be called, does fit into this. Workers are increasingly dissatisfied and increasingly hesitant about taking up particular kinds of work. And this hesitancy has been expressed on behalf of and by so called essential workers, workers who have been involved on the front lines of the pandemic. Here we’re speaking of workers in medical facilities for instance, who are part of the other Supreme Court case that involved the government’s authority to require vaccination amongst employees of medical facilities who have contact with patients.\n\nBut essential workers are now more widely understood to be a broad category—including employees who have a lot of contact with the public and also those who have been traditionally unorganized and unrepresented, so more vulnerable not only in terms of their exposure to the virus, but also more vulnerable in the workplace, generally, where they are so called marginalized workers who have had very little union representation. And we see now the unions are attempting, in some measure, to either organize such workers or to represent them more effectively, particularly here in California, where the food and commercial workers, for instance, have proposed legislation that provides for various protections for workers in groceries and supermarkets. So not only first protectors such as EMT, police, and fire, but also bus drivers and nursing home attendants and the like.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59989476', 'Headline': ""US Supreme Court blocks Biden's workplace vaccine mandate - BBC"", 'Snippet': ""Americans have become intensely divided over Covid-19 vaccine mandates The US Supreme Court has blocked President Joe Biden's rule requiring workers at large companies to be vaccinated or masked ..."", 'Full_text': 'The US Supreme Court has blocked President Joe Biden\'s rule requiring workers at large companies to be vaccinated or masked and tested weekly.\n\nThe justices at the nation\'s highest court said the mandate exceeded the Biden administration\'s authority.\n\nSeparately they ruled that a more limited vaccine mandate could stand for staff at government-funded healthcare facilities.\n\nThe administration said the mandates would help fight the pandemic.\n\nPresident Biden, whose approval rating has been sagging, expressed disappointment with the decision ""to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees"".\n\nHe added: ""I call on business leaders to immediately join those who have already stepped up - including one third of Fortune 100 companies - and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump cheered the court\'s decision, and said vaccine mandates ""would have further destroyed the economy"".\n\n""We are proud of the Supreme Court for not backing down,"" he said in a statement.

The administration was slow to encourage boosters and caught flat-footed by the Omicron-induced surge in demand for testing.\n\nNow Mr Biden will either have to convince Congress to act on mandates - an unlikely prospect given the brick wall the rest of his agenda keeps hitting in the Senate - or figure out new ways to shepherd the nation out of the pandemic gloom.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the justices agreed with that argument, saying that the workplace safety rule for large employers was too broad to fall under the authority of the Department of Labor\'s Occupational Health and Safety Administration to regulate workplace safety.\n\n""Covid-19 can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting events, and everywhere else that people gather,"" the court\'s majority wrote.\n\n""That kind of universal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases.""\n\n""This is no \'everyday exercise of federal power,\'"" they added. ""It is instead a significant encroachment on the lives - and health - of a vast number of employees.""\n\nThe more limited rule concerning more than 10 million staff at healthcare facilities that receive government funding did not pose the same concern, they decided, by 5-4.\n\nThat said imposing conditions on recipients of public money fit ""neatly"" into the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe rulings come as some parts of the policies were due to go into effect this week.

Washington Post. 8 Jun 2020. Hsiang, Solomon et al.', 'Full_text': ""The working paper calculates mortality impact estimates for each of the seven studies aiming to show the effect of the average mandated restrictions in Europe and the United States early in the pandemic compared with a policy of only recommendations. The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement. Victor Chernozhukov, a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Economics and the Statistics and Data Science Center, along with Professor Hiroyuki Kasahara and Associate Professor Paul Schrimpf, both with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia — the authors of another study that was included in the working paper — looked at the Chisadza study and provided FactCheck.org with a peer review of it. They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Over a dissent f', 'Full_text': 'OPINION ANALYSIS\n\nFractured court blocks vaccine-or-test requirement for large workplaces but green-lights vaccine mandate for health care workers\n\nWith COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reaching a new record high as a result of the Omicron variant, the Supreme Court on Thursday put the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers on hold, while litigation over its legality continues in the lower courts. Over a dissent from the court’s three liberal justices, the court ruled that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration exceeded its power in issuing the mandate. Congress may have given OSHA the power to regulate workplace dangers, the court explained, but it “has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly.” At the same time, the justices – by a vote of 5-4 – granted the administration’s request to be allowed to temporarily enforce a vaccine mandate for health care workers at facilities that receive federal funding.\n\nThe orders that the justices issued on Thursday afternoon were the latest chapter in the fast-moving vaccine disputes. After the cases came to the Supreme Court in December on an emergency basis, the justices opted to expedite the cases for oral argument on whether the mandates can remain in place while the challenges proceed in the lower courts. The court heard nearly four hours of arguments on the policies on Jan. 7 and issued a pair of unsigned opinions just six days later.\n\nThe OSHA case\n\nOSHA issued the vaccine-or-test mandate at the center of National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor in November. It required all employers with 100 or more employees – roughly two-thirds of the private sector – to compel those employees to either be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or to be tested weekly and wear masks at work. The government expected the mandate to cover 84 million workers.\n\nBusinesses, states, and nonprofits went to court to challenge the mandate, and on Thursday the Supreme Court granted their request to put it on hold. Describing the mandate as a “significant encroachment into the lives — and health — of a vast number of employees,” the court emphasized that Congress must speak clearly if it intends to give a federal agency the authority to “exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”\n\nIn this case, the court continued, Congress did not. It gave the Department of Labor the power to establish safety standards for the workplace, rather than “broad public health measures.” Although COVID-19 “is a risk that occurs in many workplaces,” the court acknowledged, it isn’t a risk that workers encounter simply by virtue of being at work – COVID-19 spreads virtually anywhere that people gather. “Permitting OSHA to regulate the hazards of daily life — simply because most Americans have jobs and face those same risks while on the clock — would significantly expand OSHA’s regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization,” the court concluded. And indeed, the court noted, the fact that OSHA has never adopted a similar regulation is a “telling indication” that the vaccine-or-test mandate exceeds the agency’s power.\n\nThe court then turned briefly to each side’s description of the effects of the policy. The challengers, the court observed, contended that the mandate would cost the states and employers billions of dollars and would prompt hundreds of thousands of employees to quit. The Biden administration, on the other hand, argued that the mandate would “save over 6,500 lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations.” But in the end, the court posited, other government actors – who are politically accountable – must “weigh such tradeoffs,” rather than the justices.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan penned a rare joint dissent in which they complained that employees, “more than any others,” have “little control, and therefore little capacity to mitigate risk” from the spread of COVID-19. The majority’s ruling, they contended, “stymies the Federal Government’s ability to counter the unparalleled threat that COVID-19 poses to our Nation’s workers.”\n\nThe dissenters tackled the same question that was at the heart of a concurring opinion filed by Justice Neil Gorsuch (and joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito): Who should decide how to respond to the pandemic? For Gorsuch, the “answer is clear”: the states and Congress. The dissenters reached a very different conclusion: OSHA, with its expertise in workplace safety and its status as a politically accountable government agency, is better suited to make decisions about how to protect workers from COVID-19 than “a court, lacking any knowledge of how to safeguard workplaces, and insulated from responsibility for any damage it causes.”\n\nThe vaccine-or-test mandate will remain on hold while the challenges to its legality continue in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.\n\nThe health care vaccine case\n\nIn Biden v. Missouri, the justices agreed to allow the Biden administration to enforce nationwide a rule that requires nearly all health care workers at facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption. The Department of Health and Human Services issued the rule, which applies to more than 10 million workers, in November, but two federal district courts – in Missouri and Louisiana – put the rule on hold in roughly half the states.\n\nIn an unsigned opinion, the court emphasized that a key responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services is “to ensure that the healthcare providers who care for Medicare and Medicaid patients protect their patients’ health and safety.” To do so, HHS has long required those providers to comply with a variety of conditions if they want to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. Because COVID-19 “is a highly contagious, dangerous, and — especially for Medicare and Medicaid patients — deadly disease,” HHS determined that a vaccine mandate was necessary to protect patients because it would decrease the chances that health care workers would both contract the virus and pass it on to their patients. Such a mandate, the court wrote, “fits neatly within” the power given to HHS by Congress.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Alito, Gorsuch, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Thomas complained that the Biden administration “proposes to find virtually unlimited vaccination power, over millions of healthcare workers, in” what he described as a “hodgepodge” of statutes – “in definitional provisions, a saving clause, and a provision regarding long-term care facilities’ sanitation procedures.” The Biden administration had not adequately explained, as far as Thomas was concerned, why Congress would have given HHS such power in relatively minor provisions. And indeed, Thomas noted, if Congress had wanted to give HHS the power to impose a vaccine mandate, “it would have done what it has done elsewhere — specifically authorize one.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://business.ku.edu/news/article/2023/01/12/costs-vs-benefits-covid-19-lockdowns-and-mask-mandates-revealed-new-research', 'Headline': 'Costs vs. benefits of COVID-19 lockdowns and mask mandates revealed in ...', 'Snippet': 'A Natural Experiment of Net Payoffs from COVID-19 Lockdowns,” analyzes both the health and economic effects of state lockdowns.

But a new study examines how the value of these actions also came with costs.\n\n“Locking down a state is a complex, difficult decision for a governor that involves examining several tradeoffs. This is why we did not limit ourselves just to the benefit of reduction in cases of the virus,” said Sajeev Nair, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Kansas.\n\n“We looked at metrics like GDP and unemployment, and, from a marketing point of view, things like consumer spending and customer satisfaction. So while there were benefits, there were also costs — and policymakers need to be mindful of weighing these aspects.”\n\nHis paper, titled “Lockdown Without Loss? A Natural Experiment of Net Payoffs from COVID-19 Lockdowns,” analyzes both the health and economic effects of state lockdowns. It determines this action reduced 480 infections per million consumers per day (equivalent to a reduction of 56%), yet they also reduced customer satisfaction by 2.2%, consumer spending by 7.5% and GDP by 5.4%, and increased unemployment by 2% per average state. It appears in the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing.\n\nCo-written with Gerard Tellis of the University of Southern California, Ashish Sood of University of California-Riverside and Nitish Sood of the Medical College of Georgia, Nair’s team addressed four key issues:\n\nWere lockdowns effective in reducing infections?\n\nWhat were the costs to consumers?\n\nDid lockdowns increase or reduce consumers’ mask adoption?\n\nDid governors’ decisions depend on medical science or non-medical drivers?\n\n“We thought the spread of the disease in the state would be the most important factor that would compel the governor to lock down,” Nair said. “But, surprisingly, we found that political affiliation was a more important factor. Democratic governors were twice as likely to lock down compared to Republican governors.”\n\nOther factors such as information cascades and policy transfer or learning were also stronger predictors of governors’ decisions to impose this than disease spread. One aspect that led to the huge public misunderstanding and criticism of lockdowns followed when cases spiked immediately afterward.\n\n“To a common man’s eye, it’s like, ‘This is not effective! Why are we locking down?’ But the surprising thing was lockdowns have a lag effect that starts kicking in in a delayed fashion due to the long incubation period of the disease,” Nair said.\n\nNair’s team utilized the benefit of a “natural experiment” in that some states locked down while some did not. Plus, many states implemented this at different times.\n\n“We considered states that locked down as test units and those that didn’t or locked down later as control units. So what we’re essentially doing is comparing neighboring states that are very similar in population density, mobility, economy, income and climate factors. These states differ only in the timing of lockdowns. Then we looked at how the cases trended before and after the lockdown,” he said.\n\nThis is technically known as a difference in difference regression model (commonly used in economics and marketing), which Nair calls a “powerful and intuitive approach.”\n\nThe research also appraised the signaling effect and the substitution effect of lockdowns.\n\nHe said, “The signaling effect is when consumers really understand the severity of the problem, so they go that extra mile to take whatever practical protection steps are needed during the lockdown. At the same time, the government was messaging that wearing masks, washing hands, etc., are good ways of preventing the disease spread. The other thing we hypothesized was people would think, ‘If there is a lockdown, I’m staying at home. Why should I use masks?’ But our data is the first to show that did not happen; the lockdowns actually increased mask adoptions by consumers.”\n\nNair said he believed the most significant takeaway of this research is that public policy actions have huge implications for the general citizen, consumers and businesses.\n\n“A lot of stakeholders are involved,” he said. “So how can governments, policymakers and even businesses think ahead of time and adapt to the situation? If consumers were adhering to things like mask mandates and being careful about limiting the disease’s spread, probably the painful lockdowns may not have been required.”\n\nHaving joined KU last semester, Nair studies marketing strategy issues using quantitative empirical methods, with a specific focus on new product management and online reviews.\n\nIf Nair were governor of Kansas and a new wave of COVID hit, would he order a lockdown and mask mandate?\n\n“Our goal is to put the message out that it’s a very complicated situation,"" Nair said. ""We are not making any policy prescriptions to any governor that if a pandemic were to happen, you have to lock down. It needs to be a decision made by weighing the costs and the benefits.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/01/13/1072165393/supreme-court-blocks-bidens-vaccine-or-test-mandate-for-large-private-companies', 'Headline': ""Supreme Court blocks Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for large private ..."", 'Snippet': ""The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration's vaccine-or-test rule Thursday, declaring that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had exceeded its authority."", 'Full_text': 'The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration\'s vaccine-or-test rule Thursday, declaring that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had exceeded its authority.\n\nBut at the same time, the court upheld a regulation issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that mandates vaccines for almost all employees at hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers that receive federal funds.\n\nThe vote to invalidate the vaccine-or-test regulation was 6 to 3, along ideological lines.\n\n""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,"" the majority said in an unsigned opinion.

Earlier this week, a record 1.4 million new cases were reported in one day. Hospitals across the country have been swamped — mainly with unvaccinated patients. The situation has been serious enough to prompt some governors to call out the National Guard to help, even as governors in some other, Republican-dominated states have made vaccine mandates illegal.\n\nIn a statement, President Biden said he was ""disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law.""\n\nThe president said his administration\'s various vaccination requirements have saved lives, and he called on ""business leaders to immediately join those who have already stepped up — including one third of Fortune 100 companies — and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.""\n\nCourt upholds mandate for health workers\n\nIn stark contrast to the decision in the OSHA case, the court voted 5 to 4 in the CMS case to uphold mandatory vaccinations for Medicare and Medicaid providers. The court\'s three liberals were joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe court said that the vaccine mandate for health care workers was, unlike the OSHA regulation, justified as just the kind of detailed regulations that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has long imposed as a condition for health care providers getting federal funds.\n\nIn addition, the court said the regulation serves to protect patients from being exposed to greater risks when they are in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory surgical care centers and other such medical providers.\n\n""The rule thus fits neatly within the language of the statute. After all, ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm,"" the court wrote in a separate the unsigned opinion. ""It would be the very opposite ... for a facility that is supposed to make people well to make them sick with COVID–19,"" the majority said, noting that in many facilities without a vaccine mandate, ""35 per cent or more of staff remain unvaccinated.""\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett dissented. All four signed two separate dissents, one by Thomas and one by Alito.\n\n""These cases are not about the efficacy or importance of COVID–19 vaccines.

Without legal basis, the court usurps a decision that rightfully belongs to others. It undercuts the capacity of the responsible federal officials, acting well within the scope of their authority, to protect American workers from grave danger.""\n\nIn a statement released later in the day, President Joe Biden celebrated the verdict in the health care worker case as one that would ""save lives,"" but he said he was disappointed that the broader workplace mandate was struck down.\n\n""I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law,"" he said, calling on individual businesses to institute their own vaccination requirements.\n\n""We have to keep working together if we want to save lives, keep people working, and put this pandemic behind us,"" he said.\n\nThe workplace rule, which was announced in November, was immediately challenged by a group of businesses and Republican states that said the government lacked the power to issue such a sweeping mandate. Lower courts initially blocked the requirement, but a later ruling allowed it to go into effect.\n\nIn lifting the earlier stay, a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the OSHA rule ""an important step in curtailing the transmission of a deadly virus that has killed over 800,000 people in the United States, brought our health care system to its knees, and cost hundreds of thousands of workers their jobs.""\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business said the appeals court ruling was ""a gut punch to America\'s small businesses who are struggling to stay in business as they come out of the pandemic.""\n\nKaren Harned, the executive director of the group\'s small business legal center, said the Supreme Court ruling was a ""welcome relief"" to businesses struggling to keep afloat during the pandemic. She expressed optimism that with the OSHA rule now halted, the lower courts will proceed to find the regulation illegal.\n\n""As small businesses try to recover after almost two years of significant business disruptions, the last thing they need is a mandate that would cause more business challenges,"" Harned said.\n\nHealth care workers mandate\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday said a separate regulation that requires vaccinations for health care workers who treat Medicare and Medicaid patients can be enforced. Two federal appeals courts had blocked enforcement in 24 states; the requirement went into effect in the remaining 26.\n\nStates opposed to the requirement said the federal law gave the government the authority to impose general health and safety rules for facilities like hospitals but did not confer the power to require vaccinations. The agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid has never before required vaccinations, they said.\n\nFour conservative justices — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett — disagreed with the majority and said they would have struck down the mandate for health care workers.

NPR's Andrea Hsu is here with details. Andrea, what did the court have to say?\n\nANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Well, on the vaccine-or-test rule, the vote was 6 to 3 to block it. The six conservative justices found that OSHA, the federal workplace safety agency, did not have the authority to issue something so sweeping. They sided with the challengers, who had argued that COVID is not a danger specific to the workplace; it's all over society. And the court said OSHA can regulate occupational hazards but not public health more broadly without clear authorization from Congress. Now, the three liberal justices said the court's decision hinders the federal government's ability to deal with the very serious threat that the virus still poses to workers.\n\nMARTIN: So how are companies themselves reacting to this?\n\nHSU: Well, the National Federation of Independent Business called the decision welcome relief for companies who are still trying to dig out from under the pandemic. And I think there's some relief even among companies that didn't object to this rule. I was at MOM's Organic Market earlier this week. It's a small grocery chain headquartered in Maryland.

Let's talk about the one that the administration succeeded in - the vaccine mandate for health care workers. Why was this one different?\n\nHSU: Well, in that case, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, two conservatives, sided with the three liberals. They found that the government can impose conditions on health care employers who get funding through Medicare and Medicaid, and most of them do. And they pointed out that vaccine requirements are actually pretty common in health care for things such as measles and hepatitis B.\n\nMARTIN: So the challengers to this rule had argued that health care workers might quit over the vaccine mandate, and that could lead to, obviously, a staffing crisis. Is that likely to happen?\n\nHSU: Well, not necessarily. First of all, health care workers do have some time before they have to be fully vaccinated. And in hospitals that already had their own mandates, most people have gotten the shots. Last night, I did check in with Ted LeNeave. He's the CEO of Accura Health Care, which runs nursing homes in the Midwest. He had been really worried about a mass exodus, but over the last few months, the vaccination rate among his employees has gone up from 60% to now just above 70%. And he thinks it's - will go up further now that the court has ruled. And yesterday he sent a blast to all his employees.\n\nTED LENEAVE: Don't panic. Don't leave. You know, if you're not vaccinated, we will have conversations with you about the vaccine, the need for the vaccine, why it's important, why it is safe.\n\nHSU: And he told them they will also discuss options for applying for religious or medical exemptions. Now, LeNeave did say that unvaccinated workers do have to be tested multiple times a week and wear N95 masks on the job.\n\nMARTIN: OK. NPR's labor correspondent Andrea Hsu. Andrea, thanks. We appreciate it.\n\nHSU: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

Depending on how the court rules, agencies could be hamstring in any situation where they’re implementing regulations that address changing circumstances without waiting for the slow-moving process of congressional lawmaking.\n\n“This isn’t really a case about emergency public health powers or even vaccination law, so much as it’s a case about how much flexibility do administrative agencies have to respond to a problem or a threat without waiting for specific authorization from Congress,” said Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at American University’s Washington School of Law.\n\nSo far, the Biden administration has run into major headwinds in its effort to defend the federal vaccine rules that have been challenged in court. Three of President Joe Biden’s major mandates – the health care worker vaccine requirement for more than 10 million people, the rules for companies with more than 100 employees and the mandate on some federal contractors – have attracted court rulings against them.\n\nMany of the court decisions blocking the mandates have backed claims of executive branch overreach while playing down the scientific rationale for requiring vaccines.\n\nOn January 7, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the federal mandate for health care workers and thetesting-or-vaccine rules for large employers. The justices scheduled expedited hearings in the cases, even though the lawsuits are still in a preliminary stage where courts aren’t making final rulings on the merits but deciding whether mandates should be frozen while the litigation plays out.\n\n“There are different issues raised when the entity that is doing the mandating is federal, and not a state actor,” said Zack Buck, a University of Tennessee College of Law professor who specializes in health law. “That goes all the way back to the founding of the country – the police power that’s retained by the states. What kind of authority does the federal government have? What kind of authority do federal agencies have? And does that matter to the Supreme Court? I think the answer is, it might.”\n\nLess leeway to require vaccines than state or private entities\n\nLower courts have been mostly permissive of vaccine mandates imposed by private companies. State governments, too, have been mostly seen by judges as having broad authority to require vaccines, as established by a 1905 Supreme Court decision that upheld Massachusetts’ smallpox inoculation requirement.\n\nIn this current pandemic, the high court’s right wing has expressed concerns about vaccine rules that don’t adequately accommodate religious objections, yet the mandates have stood\n\nBut Biden’s vaccine rules – which do include religious exemptions – have run into claims that the federal mandates encroach on the sovereignty of the states. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, in one of the most aggressive opinions against a Biden mandate, said the vaccine rule for large employers likely exceeded “federal government’s authority under the Commerce Clause because it regulates noneconomic inactivity that falls squarely within the States’ police power.”\n\nNot every lower court considering federal vaccine requirements has taken such sweeping views on the limits of federal authority in this area, and some courts have backed the legality of Biden’s vaccine moves. The employer mandate – which is being implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration – was given the green light by a separate appeals court that wiped away the 5th Circuit’s decision. Other courts have concluded that the federal mandates run afoul of the law because the executive branch is implementing them unilaterally, without express sanction from Congress.\n\nThe idea that agencies must have explicit instructions from Congress when regulating matters of significant political and economic weight has been called the “major question” doctrine. The Supreme Court has only loosely sketched out when such limits come into play, but several lower courts have cited the doctrine as reason the federal vaccine mandates should not be allowed to go into effect.\n\n“It’s not itself a very clear doctrine,” said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute. “There’s not a great sense of just how badly [agencies] have to be stretching the statute to run afoul of this doctrine.”\n\nIt will be up to the justices to decide whether they want to use the mandate cases before them to better define when agency actions are reaching beyond Congress’ directives.\n\n“For all the sort of ways that [Chief Justice John Roberts] has alienated some of the conservative movement legal folks through some of his rulings, he has seemed interested in disciplining bureaucratic agencies in a number of ways,” Wallach said. “And he’s very interested in the separation of powers.”\n\nIn addition to the disagreement between the 5th and 6th circuits over the Biden administration’s unilateral action on the large employer rules, judges have come to different conclusions about the executive branch’s ability to impose vaccine requirements on providers who participate in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nJudges in Missouri and Louisiana, in decisions left undisturbed by appeals courts, said the Department of Health and Human Services mandate ran afoul of the major question doctrine because Congress hadn’t been clear in its instructions to the agency that it could impose vaccine requirements.\n\nThe 11th Circuit pushed back on that logic, however, in an opinion that said Congress did not need to be so specific when it tasked HHS with regulating for the “health and safety” of Medicare and Medicaid recipients.\n\n“To suggest otherwise would mean that Congress had to have anticipated both the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented politicization of the disease to regulate vaccination against,” the 11th Circuit said.\n\nEven though they raise similar questions about executive branch authority, there are also distinctions in the legal footing upon which the health care worker mandate and the OSHA mandate rest.\n\nThe agencies are relying on different statutes to implement the rules. They also used different procedural mechanisms to put the policies in place.\n\nIn the health care worker mandate cases, the administration has emphasized the power it says the federal government has under the Constitution’s Spending Clause to implement the vaccine requirements. The requirements apply to health care workers – an estimated 10.3 million – at certain providers that participate in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe states that have sued the Biden administration over the rules have argued that the regulations infringe upon state sovereignty, with Florida in its legal challenge pointing to a law passed by the state’s legislature barring employer vaccine mandates.\n\n“If somehow the states can get a foothold in regulating a federal program under the federal spending power, it would be profoundly dangerous not only to the Medicare Medicaid programs, but to our system in general,” John Cogan, a health law professor at University of Connecticut School of Law, told CNN.\n\nStill, the Supreme Court has already put some limits on what the government can do with its federal health funding programs. In the Supreme Court’s first Affordable Care Act case, a 7-2 court struck down in 2012 the Obamacare provision forcing states to expand Medicaid in order to continue to participate in the program. Opponents of the new vaccine mandate – which is being implemented by HHS’ Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services – have pointed to that decision as why the requirement should be shut down.\n\n“The difference here is in [the Obamacare case], the question was it was all or nothing for the states,” Cogan said, whereas in the mandate case, “such a small percentage … of the people in the hospitals were getting booted because they wouldn’t get the vaccine.”\n\nOSHA, meanwhile, is relying on statutory language that says the agency can take steps to protect employees who are “exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful.”\n\n“CMS has used its authority to influence things like flu vaccination rates among health workers,” Wiley said. “This isn’t identical to what it’s done in the past, but it’s not as much of a step. Whereas with OSHA, you can point to instances where they’ve addressed infectious disease risk, but … there are more steps between how the agency has used this authority in the past and how it’s trying to use it now.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/22/facebook-posts/fauci-didnt-say-lockdowns-are-useful-forcing-vacci/', 'Headline': ""Fauci's comment about lockdowns, vaccination twisted out of context"", 'Snippet': 'A Facebook post suggests that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBut Fauci’s comment was taken out of context — in an MSNBC interview, he was talking specifically about vaccine efficacy and uptake in China, where there is an ongoing lockdown. And he did not indicate at any point in his 90-second reply that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies.\n\nHe made the remark during an April 14 interview with Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC, in reply to a question about China’s current approach to COVID-19. At the 6:54 mark in the video, Mitchell asked, ""How concerning is the outbreak in China?"" and mentioned the ongoing, near-total lockdown in Shanghai.\n\nPart of Fauci’s reply was, ""You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won\'t have a surge of infections, because you\'re dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they\'ve not really been exposed because of the lockdown.""\n\nHe went on to say, around the 8:25 mark, that people in China are not well-protected by vaccines — in part because China is using less effective vaccines than many other countries — and that its most vulnerable population, older people, are not vaccinated.\n\nHis observations about vaccinations in China are borne out by recent reporting.\n\nChina ""is struggling with two problems as it faces its worst COVID-19 surge since the start of the pandemic,"" according to an April 20 story in the Financial Times. The problems are ""the sluggish take-up of booster doses — authorities said this week that only 57 per cent of people over 60 have been fully vaccinated with three jabs — and homegrown vaccines that are much less effective than foreign-produced jabs.""\n\nBut the first portion of Fauci’s comment — that ""you use lockdowns to get people vaccinated"" — was seized upon by people such as Dr. Simone Gold, a founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, which became famous for voicing coronavirus conspiracy theories.\n\nGold tweeted on April 19, ""Fauci is essentially admitting that lockdowns were used to condition and control the public—putting people in such a heightened state of desperation for freedom as to compel us to take the vaccine.""\n\nThe story that the Facebook post references, from the Daily Wire, gives a more complete accounting of Fauci’s comments, but it also gives the misleading impression that Fauci is a supporter of China’s style of lockdowns.\n\nFor example, the story quotes a fragment of one of Fauci’s comments — that China’s type of strict lockdowns would never be able to be implemented in the United States, ""although that prevents the spread of infection"" — even though Fauci never said or implied that the U.S. should employ those types of lockdowns.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post suggests that Fauci said lockdowns are a method for coercing people to comply with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nThe claim includes a truncated version of Fauci’s comments that was taken out of context.\n\nIn his 90-second reply, he talked specifically about vaccine efficacy and uptake in China, where there is an ongoing lockdown.\n\nAnd Fauci did not indicate at any point that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies.\n\nWe rate this claim False.'}}",96.5,1

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60868795', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton over Russian collusion allegations.

Moscow denies any involvement.\n\nThe report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out instances where the president possibly obstructed justice.\n\nA decided longshot\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed there was a Democratic conspiracy to undermine his presidency by suggesting his campaign had nefarious ties to Russia. Now he\'s putting his lawyers where his mouth is.\n\nThe lawsuit - against members of the Clinton campaign and senior FBI officials - is a decided longshot, in part because there is ample evidence of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives as documented by Robert Mueller\'s special counsel investigation and a report by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe evidence includes the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign staff and Russian nationals and contacts Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a suspected Russian intelligence operative. While that did not lead to charges of criminal collaboration between Mr Trump\'s team and Russia, it could undermine Mr Trump\'s allegations that the Clinton team invented the Trump campaign\'s Russia connections out of whole cloth.\n\nA court victory may be unlikely, but Mr Trump can tout the lawsuit itself to his supporters as evidence that he is fighting back against his accusers. And if the case is eventually dismissed, it will be cited as a sign the establishment is still out to get him.\n\nMr Trump\'s legal complaint alleges that ""in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Mrs Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation\'s democracy.\n\n""Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.""\n\nThe complaint cites court filings made by special counsel John Durham, a US government attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump\'s justice department in 2019 to investigate whether the government acted lawfully and appropriately when collecting intelligence ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-did-it-robby-mook-michael-sussmann-donald-trump-russia-collusion-alfa-bank-11653084709', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton Did It - WSJ - The Wall Street Journal', 'Snippet': 'The Russia-Trump collusion narrative of 2016 and beyond was a dirty trick for the ages, and now we know it came from the top—candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

to search for misconduct during the investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump\'s 2016 campaign.\n\nHowever, the verdict marks a clear setback for Mr Durham\'s work, especially since Trump supporters have looked to the probe to expose what they contend was egregious bias by law enforcement officials who investigated the former president\'s campaign.\n\nThe jury deliberated for several hours on Friday afternoon and again on Tuesday morning before reaching its verdict.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse after the verdict was delivered, Mr Sussmann said he ""told the truth to the FBI, and the jury clearly recognised that with their unanimous verdict today"".\n\n""Despite being falsely accused, I am relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in this case,"" he added.\n\nIn a separate statement, Mr Durham said that, although he and his team were disappointed in the outcome, they respected the jury\'s decision.\n\nHe thanked the investigators and prosecutors on his team for their ""dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case"".\n\nSussmann accused of hiding links to Clinton campaign\n\nMr Sussmann is a cybersecurity attorney and former federal prosecutor himself.\n\nThe trial focused on a narrow issue: Whether Mr Sussmann concealed from the FBI that he was representing Ms Clinton\'s campaign when he passed along computer data that, he said, showed a possible secret communication backchannel between Russia-based Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization.\n\nThe FBI — which was already investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — examined the data but quickly determined that there was no suspicious computer contact.\n\nIts then-general counsel and the government\'s star witness, James Baker, testified that he was ""100 per cent confident"" that Mr Sussmann had told him he was not representing any client during a September 2016 meeting the two men had.\n\nProsecutors alleged Mr Sussmann was actually acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and another client, a technology executive, and that he hid that information to make the data seem more credible and to boost the chances of getting the FBI to investigate.\n\nThey pointed to a text message that Mr Sussmann sent to Mr Baker the night before the meeting, in which he requested a sit-down and said he would be coming on his own and not on behalf of any client.\n\nLawyers for Mr Sussmann denied to jurors that he lied, saying it was impossible to know with certainty what he told Mr Baker since they were the only participants in the meeting and neither of them took notes.\n\nThey argued that, although Mr Sussmann legally represented the Clinton campaign, he didn\'t attend the meeting on the campaign\'s behalf and hadn\'t asked the FBI to take any action to benefit the campaign.\n\nThey elicited testimony from former campaign officials, who said Mr Sussmann had not been authorised to visit the FBI.\n\nAnd, they said, that even if he did make a false statement, it was ultimately irrelevant, since the FBI was already investigating Russia and the Trump campaign and, given the urgency of that probe, would have looked into the Alfa Bank data no matter the source.\n\n\'Extraordinary prosecutorial overreach\'\n\nMr Sussmann\'s lawyers, Sean Berkowitz and Michael Bosworth, said in a statement Mr Sussmann should never have been charged in the first place.\n\n""This is a case of extraordinary prosecutorial overreach. And we believe that today\'s verdict sends an unmistakable message to anyone who cares to listen: Politics is no substitute for evidence, and politics has no place in our system of justice,"" the lawyers said.\n\nDuring the two-week trial, jurors heard from a slew of witnesses, including current and former FBI officials who described efforts to assess the legitimacy of the Alfa Bank data, former Clinton campaign aides as well as lawyers, colleagues and friends of Mr Sussmann, who vouched for his character.\n\nJurors were instructed to put politics aside, but Mr Trump and some of his supporters took note of the fact that the jury pool was taken from heavily Democratic Washington.\n\nThe former president wrote on his social media platform that the legal system was ""corrupt"" and referenced the acquittal as one of several examples of ""our country going to HELL"".\n\nInvestigating the investigators\n\nThe original Trump-Russia investigation — overseen for two years by former special counsel Robert Mueller — found multiple efforts by Russia to interfere on the Trump campaign\'s behalf but did not establish that the two sides had worked together to sway the outcome of the election.\n\nAfter Mr Mueller\'s work was done, then-Attorney General William Barr appointed Mr Durham, who was then a Connecticut US attorney, as a new Justice Department prosecutor, to examine whether anyone from the FBI or other agencies violated the law as the government opened its investigation into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.\n\nMr Durham has brought three criminal cases so far, although only one has been against a federal government employee and none of them has established any sort of sweeping conspiracy to frame Mr Trump nor derail his candidacy.\n\nThe Alfa Bank matter, for instance, was peripheral to the Trump-Russia probe, with the since-discredited allegations not even warranting a mention in Mueller\'s 448-page report.\n\nA former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, was given probation after pleading guilty in 2020 to altering an email related to secret surveillance of an former Trump campaign aide, and a Russian analyst, Igor Danchenko — who contributed to a dossier of Democratic-funded research into ties between Russia and Trump —awaits trial this October on charges of lying to the FBI about his sources of information.'}}",90.83333333333333,1

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Following his November 2024 election, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until after his second presidency, and the judge canceled the sentencing hearing. Trump has said he will appeal his conviction but cannot do so until after he is sentenced.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][524] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[525][526][527]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[527] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[525] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[527]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[528] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[529][530] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[531] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[532] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[533][534] On November 19, the Manhattan DA argued that the conviction should stand because no law states that temporary presidential immunity nullifies—post-trial—proceedings conducted during the president\'s time outside of office and regarding activities deemed unofficial to that post.[535]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[536][537] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[538] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[539] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[540]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[541] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][524] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[542] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[543] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[544] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[545] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[532][546]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[547] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[548][549] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[550] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[549]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week.[551] On that day, November 19, the Manhattan DA agreed to postpone sentencing until Trump leaves office.[535] On November 22, Merchan canceled the November 26 sentencing date without setting a new one.[552] Trump\'s appeal cannot take place until after sentencing.[462]\n\nProhibitory consequences\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[553] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[554] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[555] [556] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[557] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[558][559]\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[560][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[561][565]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[566] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[566][567][568] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[566][569] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[570][566]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[571][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[572]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s onetime personal lawyer and the key witness against him in his New York state criminal prosecution lost his bid Friday for early release from probation following a three-year prison sentence after federal prosecutors said he’s lying again.', 'Full_text': 'NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s onetime personal lawyer and the key witness against him in his New York state criminal prosecution lost his bid Friday for early release from probation following a three-year prison sentence after federal prosecutors said he’s lying again.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan cited Michael Cohen’s recent comments in a book and television appearance as reasons to conclude that early release from court supervision would not ensure rehabilitation and deterrence from future crimes.\n\nThe credibility of Cohen — who served as Trump’s personal lawyer from his early 2017 inauguration until his 2018 arrest — will be scrutinized if a jury ever hears the state criminal case filed against Trump over payments Cohen says he made on Trump’s behalf to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump before the Republican became president.\n\nIn court papers, federal prosecutors highlighted Cohen’s recent public comments in arguing against early release from probation rules that, among other things, restrict his travel, subject him to visits and scrutiny from a probation officer and ban him from owning firearms.\n\nProsecutors say Cohen falsely wrote in a book that he did not engage in tax fraud, that the charges were “all 100 percent inaccurate” and that he was “threatened” by prosecutors to plead guilty. They noted that under oath at his plea hearings he admitted the crimes and said he was not threatened or forced to plead guilty. They said he also lied in a March television interview.\n\nIn requesting early release for Cohen from court supervision, attorney David M. Schwartz wrote that his client has “clearly demonstrated” that he has been rehabilitated after being a model inmate in prison and after having “substantially cooperated with all government authorities.”\n\nSchwartz said via email Friday that he would leave public statements to his client. Cohen responded to a text message seeking comment by saying he will issue a statement Monday.\n\nIn 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple charges, admitting that he lied to Congress, violated campaign finance laws through excessive political contributions, lied to multiple banks to obtain financing and evaded income taxes by failing to report over $4 million in income. He was sentenced to three years in prison, although he served nearly two-thirds of it at home, released after the COVID-19 outbreak overwhelmed the nation’s prisons.\n\nDespite Cohen’s claims that he has repeatedly aided state and federal authorities in investigations and deserves credit for his cooperation, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have consistently said his lies undermine his attempts at cooperation, as they did again in opposing his request to be spared from the year and a half left of his probation.\n\nFederal prosecutors, knowing they’d have to rely on Cohen as the key witness, chose not to prosecute Trump in connection with payouts to porn star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy centerfold, Karen McDougal, to buy their silence during Trump’s successful quest in 2016 for the White House. Trump has denied the affairs.\n\nState prosecutors pursued the case and relied on Cohen’s testimony before a Manhattan grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with 34 crimes. Trump, the first ex-president to face criminal charges, pleaded not guilty to the charges in early April.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-expert-witnesses-billed-almost-900000-dollars-each-testifying-fraud-trial-new-york-city/', 'Headline': ""Expert witnesses for Trump's defense billed almost $900,000 each for ..."", 'Snippet': 'Trump to testify as final defense witness in fraud trial 05:12. New York City — Former President Donald Trump sat attentively in the courtroom of his New York civil fraud trial on Thursday ...', 'Full_text': 'New York City — Former President Donald Trump sat attentively in the courtroom of his New York civil fraud trial on Thursday, watching as the defense\'s final expert witness, Eli Bartov, proclaimed that there was ""no evidence whatsoever of any accounting fraud.""\n\nOn Friday, Bartov revealed that he has made approximately $877,500 for his expert testimony in this case — charging $1,350 per hour for about 650 hours of work. When questioned by lawyers for the state of New York about who was paying him, Bartov replied that his bank statements showed some of the money was paid by the Trump Organization and some came from Trump\'s Save America PAC.\n\nThe discussion of Bartov\'s compensation came shortly after one of Trump\'s attorneys, Alina Habba, expressed her frustration to Judge Engoron about objections made by the attorney general\'s team.\n\n""Why are we wasting our time if no one is listening to the words coming out of our experts\' mouths?"" Habba asked.\n\nAnother expert witness for the defense, Frederick Chin, who testified earlier in the week on real estate valuation, admitted that he billed $850 per hour for 1,000 hours of work, totaling $850,000. The state\'s only expert witness, Michael McCarty, acknowledged that he was paid a rate of $950 per hour, but worked far fewer hours, estimating that he made about $350,000 for his testimony.\n\nThese rates provide a glimpse into the high costs of just one of Trump\'s many legal battles, a set of criminal and civil challenges for which the Save America PAC spent $40 million in the first half of this year alone.\n\nTrump stayed at the courthouse all day for Thursday\'s proceedings and periodically spoke outside the courtroom throughout the day, lauding Bartov, an accounting professor at New York University\'s Stern School of Business, and his testimony several times.\n\n""This is a disgraceful situation. Never seen anything like it,"" said Trump. ""But this expert witness, highly respected by everybody, with a resume that few people have ever seen before, said there was no fraud, there was no accounting fraud, there was nothing.""\n\nHe later praised Bartov\'s credentials as ""a leading expert, a leading person, a man who sits on the Pulitzer committee, most respected person, the Stern School, NYU, top professor, a very honest man who by the way, (is) very honorable,"" and said, ""If he didn\'t agree, he wouldn\'t say what he\'s saying.

You make up allegations that never existed. There is no evidence of this.""\n\nIn his testimony, Bartov strongly disputed the grounds of the lawsuit brought by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, saying that from an accounting perspective, it has no merit. He said that Trump\'s use of disclaimers in his financial statements clearly indicated that lenders should do their own due diligence and downplayed discrepancies in the financial statements, explaining that lenders are expected to make their own independent valuations.\n\n""To me, the case isn\'t about valuations. It\'s about statements of financial conditions,"" said Judge Engoron during a tense exchange with Trump\'s attorneys on Friday. ""You can\'t use false statements in business. That\'s what the summary judgment decision was all about. I think it\'s pretty much what the rest of this case was about.""\n\nJudge Engoron ruled before the trial began that Trump and the other defendants were liable for fraud in a partial summary judgment. Trump, his older two sons Donald Jr and Eric, and their company are accused of inflating the value of assets on key financial records to obtain favorable loans and insurance deals. They have denied wrongdoing in the case.\n\nTrump, who already testified last month, was scheduled to return to court on Monday, Dec. 11 but then announced the day before that he will not testify again after all.\n\nCross-examination of Bartov is expected to resume on Tuesday, as this case comes to a close.\n\n— Graham Kates contributed to this report.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/trump-indictment-prosecutors-evidence-use-3bfb585a084df90305dc410957d1ef6d', 'Headline': 'Trump might use trial docs to scorch witnesses, DA says', 'Snippet': '2 of 2 | .

That kind of evidence sharing, called discovery, is routine in criminal cases, and is intended to help ensure a fair trial.\n\nProsecutors want to block Trump from posting evidence to social media or providing it to third parties. They also want to restrict how he views certain sensitive material, asking that he do so only in the presence of his lawyers — and that he not be able to copy, photograph or transcribe those records.\n\nTrump “has a longstanding and perhaps singular history of attacking witnesses, investigators, prosecutors, trial jurors, grand jurors, judges, and others involved in legal proceedings against him,” Assistant District Attorney Catherine McCaw wrote.\n\nThat behavior, she said, has put “those individuals and their families at considerable safety risk.”\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule on the prosecution’s request. McCaw, in her filing, asked him to schedule a hearing on the matter next week.\n\nEmail messages seeking comment were left with Trump’s lawyers.\n\nProsecutors first raised concerns about Trump potentially weaponizing the discovery process at his April 4 arraignment on charges that he falsified records at his company as part of a broader 2016 scheme to make secret hush-money payments to bury allegations of extramarital sexual encounters. Trump has denied wrongdoing — or having extramarital affairs — and pleaded not guilty.\n\nWith Trump sitting at the defense table just feet away from her, McCaw told Merchan that a protective order was needed to “ensure the sanctity of the proceedings as well as the sanctity of the discovery materials.”\n\nAt the time, McCaw said prosecutors and Trump’s lawyers were close to a joint agreement with many of the restrictions prosecutors are now asking Merchan to impose.

Costello’s testimony was expected to give the former president an indirect opportunity to make a case that he shouldn’t face criminal charges, though there were no clear signs his appearance had changed the course of the grand jury probe.\n\nCohen had been available for over two hours to rebut the testimony but was not needed, his attorney said Monday.\n\nCostello had provided Cohen, himself a lawyer, legal services several years ago. In a news conference after his grand jury appearance, he told reporters that he had come forward to provide exculpatory information about Trump and to make clear that he did not believe Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal crimes and served time in prison, could be trusted.\n\n“If they want to go after Donald Trump and they have solid evidence then so be it,” Costello said. “But Michael Cohen is far from solid evidence.”\n\nResponding to Costello’s claims on MSNBC later Monday, Cohen said that Costello was never his lawyer and “he lacks any sense of veracity.”\n\nThe testimony came two days after Trump said he expected to face criminal charges and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. In a series of social media posts through the weekend, the former Republican president criticized the New York investigation, directing particularly hostile rhetoric toward Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.\n\nIt’s not clear when prosecutors might wrap up their work, but law enforcement in New York has been making physical preparations for any unrest surrounding a possible indictment. In the morning, a New York Police Department truck began dropping off portable metal barricades that could be used to block off streets or sidewalks.\n\nCostello briefly acted as a legal adviser to Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen’s home and apartment in 2018. At the time, Cohen was being investigated for both tax evasion and for payments he helped orchestrate in 2016 to buy the silence of two women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nFor several months, it was unclear whether Cohen, a longtime lawyer and fixer for the Trump Organization who once boasted that he would “take a bullet” for his boss, would remain loyal to the president.\n\nCohen ultimately decided to plead guilty in connection with the payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, which he said were directed by Trump. Since then, he has been a vociferous Trump critic, testifying before Congress and then to the Manhattan grand jury.\n\nTrump, who has denied having sex with either woman, has branded Cohen a liar. Costello broke with Cohen before he pleaded guilty, after it became clear he was no longer in Trump’s camp.\n\nIn the years since, Costello, a veteran New York attorney, has represented Trump allies including his former political strategist Steve Bannon and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nEven as the New York investigation pushes toward conclusion, Trump faces criminal probes in Atlanta and Washington that, taken together, pose significant legal peril and carry the prospect of upending a Republican presidential race in which Trump remains a leading contender. Some of his likely opponents have tried to strike a balance between condemning a potential prosecution as politically motivated while avoiding condoning the conduct at issue.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the investigation but also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a move likely to intensify their simmering political rivalry.\n\n“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair,” DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. “I can’t speak to that.”\n\nBut, he added, “what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”\n\nMike Pence, the former vice president who’s expected to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination, castigated Trump in an ABC News interview last weekend as “reckless” for his actions on Jan. 6 and said history would hold him accountable. Even so, he echoed the former president’s rhetoric that an indictment would be a “politically charged prosecution.”\n\n“I have no doubt that President Trump knows how to take care of himself,” Pence said. “And he will. But that doesn’t make it right to have a politically charged prosecution of a former president.”\n\n___\n\nTucker reported from Washington. Associated Press journalists Michelle L.

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week. James’ office will have 90 minutes for an opening statement Monday, while lawyers for the multiple Trump defendants will have two hours.\n\nTrump and his two adult sons have denied any wrongdoing.

The Trump campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article.\n\nSome of the statistics cited on projections at Donald Trump’s rally Dec. 16, 2023, in Durham, N.H. (Rebecca Catalanello/PolitiFact)\n\n""Under Joe Biden, we’ve had a three-year inflation rate of 20%.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe standard inflation measure, the consumer price index, has risen by 17.2% since January 2021, when Biden took office. That was an increase over three years, so the annual inflation rate was lower — about 5.9% per year during Biden’s presidency.\n\nRising wages have helped consumers manage some of this increase in prices.\n\nA standard wage measure, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, has risen by 14% during Biden’s presidency, or about 4.8% per year. That means wages are still trailing inflation by about 1.1% a year, but it’s a smaller gap than Trump’s headline number.\n\nThe time frame for the calculation also matters.\n\nAs inflation has cooled over the past year, wage gains have narrowed the cumulative shortfall from inflation. Since November 2022, inflation has risen by 3.1%, but wages have risen by 4%. If the pattern holds, wage growth during Biden’s presidency may soon surpass the increase in prices.\n\nAlso, Americans are in a better place than they were on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, which started during Trump’s last year in office. Since February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit, inflation has increased by 18.8%, while wages have increased by 19.4%.\n\n""After three years of Bidenomics, the 30-year mortgage rate has hit a 22-year high.""\n\nThis is Mostly True. Numerically, Trump is on target. However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage peaked at 7.79% on Oct. 26, 2023. That was the highest since the identical percentage on Nov. 10, 2000.\n\nMortgage rates have spiked because the Federal Reserve in March 2022 began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Fed interest rate hikes are considered the most effective economic tools for curbing inflation, because they tend to cool the economy, which eases demand and lowers prices.\n\nSince the Fed hikes began, inflation has receded by about two-thirds. But a side effect has been that other types of interest rates — including mortgages — have also risen.\n\nSince the mortgage rate peak in October, the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has fallen, hitting 6.67% on Dec. 21. Not counting the peak in recent months, that’s still higher than any rate going back to Aug. 2, 2007, when the rate was 6.68%.\n\nEconomists generally agree that some of Biden’s policies likely added to the pressures that pushed up prices.\n\nBiden’s coronavirus relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, put stimulus money into Americans’ hands when supply chains couldn’t produce enough goods to fulfill consumer demand. This worsened the rise of prices, which started because of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions.\n\nHowever, ""the drivers of this inflation go back to COVID-19 — issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,"" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in October. ""That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.""\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden should ""assume some responsibility, but so should members of Congress who voted in favor of stimulus payments, tax cuts, generous unemployment benefits, aid to states and private businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic recession.""\n\nThe American Rescue Plan got no Republican support in Congress, but earlier pandemic relief bills Trump signed were passed with bipartisan support.\n\n""The average monthly mortgage payment: Under Trump, $1,746; Under Biden: $3,322.""\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThese are the figures for average monthly payments on a new home, real estate company CBRE reports. That’s a significant out-of-pocket increase for someone buying a new home, but it doesn’t affect homeowners who aren’t looking to move.\n\nThe figure is calculated for the purchase of a new home valued at the U.S. median of $430,000, with a 10% down payment.\n\nThe majority of American mortgage holders have fixed-rate mortgages that were locked in at much lower rates. In 2022, about 85% of mortgages had fixed rates.\n\nGiven the current high rates, adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining popularity. If mortgage rates decrease in 2024, homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages should see their payments drop.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/17/us/politics/trump-rally-arizona.html', 'Headline': ""On the Scene: Trump's Latest Rally - The New York Times"", 'Snippet': 'On the Scene: Trump’s Latest Rally.

But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.\n\nHere are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:\n\nTrump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nTrump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.\n\nTrump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.\n\nTrump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”\n\nTrump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.\n\nTrump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.\n\nRead more takeaways from tonight’s town hall here and read our team’s fact checks here.\n\nOne of the many jarring moments during CNN’s town hall with former President Donald Trump occurred when the moderator, CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, was asking Trump why he held on to classified documents when he left the White House. The FBI later recovered them from Mar a Lago by executing a search warrant.\n\nWhen Collins pointed out that the difference between Trump and Joe Biden, who also faces questions about classified documents found at his house but who didn’t ignore a subpoena, Trump interrupted her.\n\n“Are you ready? Can I talk?” Trump demanded. “Do you mind?”\n\n“Yeah, I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it,” Collins said.\n\n“It’s very simple that you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said, attempting to insult her as his supporters in the crowd cheered.\n\n“Can you answer why you held on to the documents?” Collins asked again, at which point Trump launched into a rambling answer that boils down to he was negotiating with the National Archives during the year-plus when the government was seeking them.\n\nIt’s the insult to Collins’ face, calling her “nasty,” that was jarring. And the cheering crowd made it more so.\n\nThe word has long been a favorite insult of Trump’s, often hurled at women who frustrate him.\n\nHe called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” at the close of the final presidential debate in 2016.\n\nHe’s used it on Vice President Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOf Meghan Markle, who had criticized him, in 2019, Trump told a British newspaper, “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”\n\nAfter he hurled the insult at Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen later that summer, the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake documented 14 times Trump had used the insult to describe a woman. He found even more instances of Trump using the word to describe a man, although some of those appeared to be complements.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that the classified documents from the White House were “automatically declassified” when he took them to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence to back up this assertion. Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so.\n\nThe Justice Department said in an August 2022 court filing that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified—not in January 2022 when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings, nor in June 2022 when Trump’s team responded to a subpoena by returning another batch that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\nIn addition, 18 former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN at the time that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump asserted Wednesday night that “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.\n\nFacts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying of the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe January 6 riot of by Trump supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.\n\nThe number of rioters who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees. That includes more than 100 people charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer. About five dozen have pleaded guilty to felony charges for these types of crimes.\n\nAnd the FBI is still seeking information to identify more than 220 others who may have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds.\n\nEven Trump-appointed federal judges have countered claims that left-leaning rioters in Portland, for instance, acted similarly to the pro-Trump crowd on January 6.\n\nJudge Trevor McFadden wrote when handling a January 6 rioter’s case in 2021: “Although both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse. In contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it.”\n\nAnd another federal judge in DC, Carl Nichols, wrote: “The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America’s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings’ outer defenses.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s answers to questions from New Hampshire voters about a variety of topics at the CNN town hall Wednesday may have opened the door for other Republicans to challenge him in the 2024 presidential primary race, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House director of communications and CNN political commentator, said.\n\nThe former president often dodged directly answering questions and giving specific policy stances in the town hall, such as not saying if he would sign a federal abortion ban or if he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the war. Trump repeated his election lies and attempted to repaint his role during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nIssues like crime and the economy, however, are what are on the minds of most voters on a day-to-day basis, Farah Griffin said.\n\nFarah Griffin pointed to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ super PAC criticizing Trump as an example of how other candidates could be taking advantage.\n\n“After 76 years, Trump still doesn’t know where he stands on important conservative issues like supporting life and the 2nd amendment. How does that Make America Great Again?” the statement said.\n\nThe super PAC in a tweet also touched on several issues including possible pardons for January 6 rioters and the investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — topics that DeSantis has not criticized Trump over and in some cases has outright avoided discussing at all.\n\n“This to me actually became an opening for a Republican to take him on and say, if you want a lot of the policies — not insane things like family separation — and you don’t want chaos and anti-democratic positions,” Farah Griffin said.\n\nCNN’s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed reporting to this post.\n\nFormer and current Republican governors reacted to former President Trump’s claims throughout CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday evening.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu: The Republican governor told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Trump didn’t say anything that he thinks will help him win the GOP nomination for president. “It was kind of the same old thing, the same old regurgitation. He had a chance to move on from 2020, he didn’t do it. He had a chance to own some of the issues of January 6, what his role there was. He didn’t do it. He had the chance to take shots at Joe Biden, he didn’t do it,” Sununu said.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: After Donald Trump said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, the Republican tweeted that “despite how ridiculous that is to say, I suspect he would try to do it by turning Ukraine over to Putin and Russia. #Putin’sPuppet.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson: The 2024 challenger to Trump said on CNN that the former president “had a weak performance and he’s locked in the past.”\n\n“He had a goal, I’m sure, to expand his base to be able to prove that he can attract independents and the suburban voters. He failed that test. He narrowed his base of support, he’s locked in the past, he didn’t address the issues (of) the future,” the Republican said.\n\n“Whenever he was asked about the economy, he gave one brief response on energy policy, but really didn’t address the broad range of things we have in our economy to get it going again,” he added.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took questions from Republican and undeclared voters in New Hampshire at the town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump remained defiant about his lies regarding the 2020 election, as well as the many investigations into him – making clear that he’s sticking to the script he’s delivered over the past two years on conservative media.\n\nHere is some of what he said on key topics:\n\nElection lies: Trump again refused to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election several times, and instead reiterated false claims that the election was rigged. CNN’s Collins continuously pushed back and pointed to statements by Trump’s own election officials noting the election was conducted fairly. He later only said he would accept the 2024 presidential election results if he believed they were “honest.”\n\nJanuary 6 insurrection: Trump blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among others, saying they were at fault for the security failures on January 6, 2021. Trump falsely claimed that he called on the National Guard to intervene during the riot and in an extended exchange with Collins about the riot, Trump attempted to repaint his role during the insurrection. He also said he would pardon “a large portion” of rioters.\n\nMike Pence: Trump said that he does not feel like he owes his former vice president an apology. Pence has said the former president endangered his life during the January 6 insurrection. “No, because he did something wrong. He should’ve put the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would’ve had a different outcome,” Trump said, though Pence did not have the authority to reject election results.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Trump continued to deny knowing the columnist and denied accusations, just a day after a jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her in a department store. The former president also ridiculed Carroll and said he does not believe the verdict disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nThe economy: If reelected, Trump said his solution to inflation would be drilling for more oil in the US. The former president then claimed that under his presidency, the country was energy independent and that the cost of gas went down to record lows. You can read a fact check on those claims here.\n\nThe debt ceiling: Trump said the US should default on its debt if the White House does not agree to Republican spending cuts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit. The White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue.\n\nGun violence: The former president pledged to protect the Second Amendment if he is back in the White House. He said he would address mental health problems as well as “do numerous things” to address mass shootings, including hiring more security guards for schools and what he called “hardening” entrances to establishments.\n\nAbortion: Trump would not say if he would sign a federal abortion ban if he was reelected or at how many weeks during pregnancy he would support a ban. Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.” He argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe war in Ukraine: Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Russian President Vladimir Putin and solve the war in Ukraine “in one day, 24 hours.” He would not say if he believed Putin was a war criminal and said the Russian leader “made a mistake” going into Ukraine, arguing he wouldn’t have done so if Trump was president. Trump wouldn’t say whether he wants Ukraine or Russia to win the war.\n\nClassified documents: The former president insisted that he had “every right” to take classified documents with him after he left the White House. He falsely claimed that the documents became declassified when he took them with him.\n\nAsked why he took classified documents with him after leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump said he “had every right to under the Presidential Records Act.”\n\n“I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified,” Trump said during Wednesday night’s CNN town hall.\n\nCollins corrected Trump saying the Presidential Records Act does not say a former president can take documents home but says they are the property of the federal government when a president is out of office.\n\nAfter Trump and Collins went back and forth on previous presidents taking classified documents, Collins pushed back saying previous presidents didn’t wait to return classified documents and asked numerous times why Trump waited to return classified documents when he knew the federal government was seeking them and subpoenaed him to return them.\n\nTrump did not answer the question but instead insulted Collins.\n\n“It’s very simple — you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday would not say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected when pressed several times by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, but argued those in the anti-abortion movement are “in a very good negotiating position right now” because of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country” when asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban.\n\nAs many states move to restrict abortion rights after the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion, Trump would not specify whether he would support a federal ban or at how many weeks during a pregnancy he would support a ban.\n\n“I’m looking at a solution that’s going to work. Very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue, but we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren’t able to get rid of, you wouldn’t be having a discussion, if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe V. Wade,” Trump said.\n\nMore context: In the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have enacted sweeping abortion restrictions. But unpopularity, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, over severe restrictions has prompted Republicans to reconsider the political wisdom of enacting near-total bans on the procedure, and House Republicans have recently stepped away from pushing a federal abortion ban.\n\nMarta Saravia, an undeclared voter, asked former President Donald Trump what he thought of the debt situation and how the country can move forward.\n\n“We have to start paying off debt … I say to the Republicans out there — Congressmen, Senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.\n\nCollins asked Trump to clarify, asking him if he thinks the US should default if the White House does not agree to spending cuts the Republicans are demanding.\n\nMore context: The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\n\nThe White House and GOP Republicans are in a standoff over how to resolve the issue. House Republicans want to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.\n\nA breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he does not think a recent verdict in which a Manhattan federal jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room disqualifies him from being president or will have an impact on women voters.\n\nHe denied knowing the columnist and denied the accusations. Trump ridiculed Carroll while discussing the trial, only a day after the verdict was handed down.\n\n“A Manhattan jury found you sexually abused writer E. Jean You’ve denied this. But what do you say to voters who say it disqualifies you from being president?” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked.\n\nTrump answered that he didn’t think there were many voters who would think that. He claimed that the case was made up and that it was all politically motivated. He repeated that he did not know Carroll, but said that he took a photo “years ago” with her and her husband.\n\nWhen asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”\n\nSome context: A Manhattan federal jury found Tuesday that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the spring of 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nCarroll alleged Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict.\n\nWhile the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.\n\nCarroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill that opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation.\n\nThere’s a definite feel at Saint Anselm College that the 2024 presidential campaign is really beginning tonight. There’s excitement, tension and dissent in the air that recalls the build-up to a presidential debate.\n\nThe fact that the unpredictable Donald Trump is the presidential frontrunner after a tumultuous presidency and refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election is only deepening the feeling that something big is about to happen – as town hall attendees line up to clear Secret Service security checks near protesters shouting anti-Trump slogans.\n\nMany of the registered Republicans and voters who plan to vote in the 2024 GOP primary are hoping they will get called upon.\n\nOne Trump supporter, Karen Langella, said that she hoped that the questions would “not focus on what happened” on Tuesday when a jury found Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 in New York and that he was liable for battery and defamation after a civil trial.\n\nLangella’s daughter, Isabella, who is an independent and shopping around for the most conservative Republican candidate, hoped that “people stick to his ideas and his policies instead of what happened 20 years ago.”\n\nAnother attendee, Al Peel, hoped to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on how to help homeless veterans. He also wanted the former president to tone down his wild antics and focus instead on policies.\n\n“I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results,” he added.\n\nAcross the road, a crowd of students held up signs reading “love Trumps hate” and “nobody is above the law,” while chanting “You’re abhorrent, you’re broke, you lost the popular vote.”\n\nMore about the town hall location: Saint Anselm College has its own fabled history in presidential campaigns. Republican Richard Nixon made it his first stop in his successful 1968 bid for the presidency. Pretty much every one who is anyone in presidential politics has visited — from Ronald Reagan, both presidents Bush, Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe Benedictine liberal arts college hosted a fiery Democratic presidential debate days before the 2008 primary that saw Hillary Clinton win a comeback victory after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses — though it was a false dawn for the then New York senator’s campaign.\n\nIt’s long been known that former President Donald Trump’s actions while in office have upended the norms of the presidency — from his use of social media to make major announcements to his use of the pardon power to the amount of turnover in his administration.\n\nThe story of the Trump presidency cannot be fully told in numbers. But here are some numbers illustrate some of the many ways Trump and his administration defied the status quo of the executive branch.\n\nJudicial appointments: Trump was able to successfully appoint three US Supreme Court justices, and he’s surpassed the number of federal judges appointed by George H.W. Bush — the most recent one-term president.\n\nEarlier in 2020, Trump was also on track to appoint more federal appellate judges than any recent president at the same point in his presidency, according to the Pew Research Center. Although Trump served only four years, his changes to the makeup of federal courts will be felt long after he leaves the White House.\n\nExecutive action: As of December 11, 2020, there had been 520 presidential documents signed by Trump — including executive orders, presidential memorandums, determinations and notices — had been published in the Federal Register. Of those, 288 were executive orders and presidential memorandums, not including memos were clerical in nature.\n\nPresidents have increasingly used executive orders and presidential memorandums interchangeably to issue directives to their agencies; they are both legally binding, though executive action can be undone by the next president.\n\nThe increased reliance on such actions has come as an increasingly gridlocked Congress has made it difficult for presidents to act on their agendas.\n\nObama had issued 226 executive orders and memorandums at this point in his tenure in office, while George W. Bush had signed 189.\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump complained about what he saw as Obama’s overuse of executive authority but also suggested that the government could be run like a business.\n\nYet Trump has already exceeded both George W. Bush and Obama in the number of published executive orders and memorandums.\n\nRead about other key figures from his presidency here.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign is pursuing a strategy of expanding his appeal by reaching out to audiences beyond friendly conservative media outlets, multiple advisers familiar with the strategy said, including a CNN town hall this week.\n\nThe town hall event in New Hampshire Wednesday evening, Trump’s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 election, joins a list of other signs that Trump is adopting a more traditional campaign in his third run for the White House.\n\nThe former president has surrounded himself with a more organized, experienced team to complement his unconventional campaign style. He’s also scaling back larger rallies, a Trump campaign trademark, for more intimate campaign settings and retail stops that allow the former president to engage with voters.\n\nThat approach speaks to an acknowledgment by the Trump campaign and its allies that the former president must broaden his appeal inside and outside the Republican Party if he is to clinch the GOP nomination and retake the White House in 2024, following his failed reelection bid and disappointing results by Republicans in last year’s midterm elections. The process is being driven by a team of veteran political operatives, skilled in matters such as the delegate process, who believe Trump’s path to victory cannot simply be a reprisal of his insurgent 2016 bid or his large, expensive 2020 operation.\n\nThe former president’s team has increased its outreach with traditional news outlets, taking questions from television and print correspondents on recent campaign swings from organizations Trump has spent years attacking.\n\nTrump’s team also sees the town hall has an opportunity to draw a contrast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has clashed with what he often refers to as “legacy media” organizations.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nWednesday’s live town hall audience will be made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary.\n\nThis is Trump’s third trip to the Granite State since launching his campaign last fall. He handily won the primaries there in 2016 and 2020 before losing the state in both general elections.\n\nNew Hampshire is the second state to vote in the Republican presidential nominating calendar — but after the Iowa caucuses, it’s the first primary to take place.\n\nThe Granite State has long prized its role in vetting presidential contenders, and state law protects that status: Secretary of State David Scanlan is required to set a primary date a week ahead of any other “similar contests” elsewhere on the map. Democrats have reshuffled their primary calendar, leaving some dates in flux, but the GOP has maintained New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status.\n\nThough New Hampshire is among the smallest states in delegate counts, it has a history of propelling primary winners forward toward Super Tuesday with momentum — and winnowing out candidates who fail to gain traction there.\n\nThe winners of the last two competitive New Hampshire Republican presidential primaries, Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 went on to win the party’s nomination.\n\nNew Hampshire’s primary allows “undeclared” voters — those who are not registered as Democrats or Republicans — to choose which primary they participate in. It’s a key voting bloc since about two-in-five New Hampshire voters are undeclared.\n\nThe process has its quirks: Three tiny locations, Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield, vote at midnight and report their tiny numbers of votes immediately. Those vote tallies aren’t large enough sample sizes to be indicative of anything, but they are the only known results for nearly 20 hours, until polls elsewhere close that evening.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, will take questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters in a CNN town hall Wednesday as a myriad of legal issues loom over his 2024 White House bid.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins at Saint Anselm College and is Trump’s first appearance on the network since 2016.\n\nTrump is set to face voters as he deals with unprecedented legal clouds hanging over him and as he seeks to become only the second commander-in-chief, ever, elected to two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe town hall comes just a day after a Manhattan federal jury found the former president sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996 and awarded her $5 million for battery and defamation.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and called the verdict in the civil case a “total disgrace.”\n\nLast month in New York, he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC — where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations — and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.\n\nStill, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts.\n\nThat’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”\n\nWhile a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary, and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid — Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling.\n\nIn a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.\n\nTrump’s participation in the town hall is indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump enters Wednesday’s CNN town hall as both the prohibitive GOP frontrunner for the 2024 nomination and a man just found liable in a civil case for sexually abusing and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump’s large polling advantage was built with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)\n\nThe leads Trump has in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage are some of the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era.\n\nTrump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits.\n\nThere are very few candidates, of either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. Those included Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close.\n\nInterestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that at closer to 30 points, on average.\n\nYou can read more about the polls here.\n\nThe first reaction to Tuesday’s unprecedented verdict finding a former president and current White House candidate liable for sexual abuse offered no reason to suggest that Donald Trump’s position as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination is under any immediate threat.\n\nBut some of his GOP critics raised questions about his fitness for office that are certain to be at the center of the next general election if he is the Republican nominee.\n\nThe unanimous verdict could deepen his vulnerability among key voting groups, including women – among whom the GOP needs to improve to win back the White House.\n\nThe jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.\n\nFor most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents. But the fact that Trump won’t quit the GOP race – and no one will make him – shows his dominance of the Republican Party, and how he redefined behavioral expectations for public life.\n\nRead the full analysis here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/biden-beat-trump-in-tv-town-hall-views-while-tiktok-helped-biden-online/', 'Headline': 'Trump vs Biden Town Hall: Who Got the Most Views Online & on TV?', 'Snippet': 'Biden’s town hall had 12.3 million total viewers with an average 2.6 rating in the 18-24 demographic, TV Line reported.

Who had the most views? Biden’s town hall won out with TV viewers. Online viewers are a bit tougher to compare since TikTok encouraged viewers to use multiple devices to watch Biden’s event, while Trump’s was available in more locations online.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nBiden Beat Trump in TV Viewers\n\nBiden beat Trump in total TV viewers according to a number of viewership categories. Biden’s town hall had 12.3 million total viewers with an average 2.6 rating in the 18-24 demographic, TV Line reported. In contrast, Trump’s town hall had 10.4 million total viewers with a 1.7 demo rating. Trump benefited from his town hall also airing on MSNB and CNBC, while Biden’s aired only on ABC.\n\nSamba TV, a TV data and analytics provider, revealed that 6.3 million households watched Trump’s town hall on TV, while 6.9 million households watched Biden’s, Advanced Television reported.\n\nOnline Viewers Are Tougher To Compare\n\nMeanwhile, online viewers are a bit tougher to compare. Biden’s town hall was aired on one YouTube channel live, while Trump’s was aired on multiple channels. Biden’s ABC News stream had 2.9 million views as of the time of publication.\n\nIn contrast, Trump’s NBC News stream had 2 million views as of the time of publication.\n\nHowever, he also had streams on CNBC Television (1.1 million views) and CNBC (1.7 million views.)\n\nA TikTok campaign might have also skewed the Biden vs Trump online numbers, Newsweek reported.\n\nHank Green made a TikTok video encouraging viewers to help Biden get better ratings online by watching his town hall on multiple devices live as it aired.\n\nOthers watched Biden’s town hall on multiple tabs to help him get more views.\n\nBiden’s and Trump’s town halls aired at the same time on Thursday night. Trump’s aired on NBC News at 8 p.m. Eastern, while Biden’s aired on ABC News at 8 p.m. Eastern. Trump’s town hall was moderated by Savannah Guthrie of Today. George Stephanopoulos moderated Biden’s tow hall.\n\nThese aired instead of the second presidential debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates, following safety protocols, decided the second debate needed to be virtual. While Biden’s campaign was ready to take part in the debate, Trump’s campaign announced that he would not participate in a virtual debate. Trump’s campaign said there was no medical reason to have a virtual debate and claimed that the decision was biased for Biden, NPR reported. Biden’s campaign stated that Trump “clearly does not want to face questions from the voters about his failures on COVID and the economy.”\n\nThe Commission said in a statement about the second debate’s cancelation:\n\nOn October 8, CPD announced that for the health and safety of all involved, the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 15 in Miami, would be conducted virtually. Subsequently, the campaigns of the two candidates who qualified for participation in the debate made a series of statements concerning their respective positions regarding their willingness to participate in a virtual debate on October 15, and each now has announced alternate plans for that date. It is now apparent there will be no debate on October 15.”\n\nThe next debate on October 22 is still scheduled to happen.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/opinions/commentary-trump-cnn-town-hall/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: The chilling reality of Trump - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his ...', 'Full_text': 'CNN Opinion asked expert contributors to weigh in with their reactions to former President Donald Trump’s CNN town hall on Wednesday night. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nPaul Begala: Trump whined, griped and complained\n\nMore than 400,000 Americans died from Covid-19 during the Trump presidency. 2.9 million Americans lost their jobs while former President Donald Trump was in the White House. Opioid deaths skyrocketed, and the national debt exploded by $7 trillion during Trump’s tenure.\n\nBut in tonight’s CNN town hall, Trump told us who the real victim of this era is: Donald Trump.\n\nFrom the opening question to his last comment, Trump whined, griped and complained. It was an airing of grievances that will doubtless thrill his MAGA base, but may well motivate anti-Trump voters just as much. And there’s little indication he did enough to win over independent voters.\n\nThis was vintage Trump: whining about the election he lost, grumbling about being indicted in New York, moaning about the jury that found him liable for the civil offense of sexual abuse and defamation. He used the first-person pronoun in nearly every sentence, sounding like a tenor warming up for the opera: “Me, me, me, me, meeeeee.”\n\nHe failed to acknowledge the very real pain felt by so many Americans – including the millions who voted for him. There was not a hint of empathy for the heroic cops who were brutally attacked on January 6. Not a mention of the struggling rural families wrestling with the demon of opioid abuse. Not a word of thanks for veterans and their families. Not a thought for the tens of millions of women whose rights have been rolled back by Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices – just triumphant boasting about how he was the GOP president who actually delivered on the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt’s all about him. It always has been. Trump is a narcissist in a hall of mirrors.\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.\n\nJill Filipovic: Trump needs women to win in 2024, but he doesn’t seem to care\n\nIf female voters are key to a Donald Trump victory in 2024, the former president should be in big trouble – but he doesn’t seem to care.\n\nAfter being found liable for sexual abuse by a New York jury earlier this week, Trump took to the CNN town hall stage Wednesday night and proceeded to mock and berate Kaitlan Collins, the female anchor questioning him (a “nasty” person, he called her) after mocking and berating E. Jean Carroll, who just bested him in court. And to boot, he boasted about his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a move that cost many Republicans elections.\n\nA man whose misogyny was so extreme and unvarnished he inspired the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement is back. On Wednesday night, he made clear that he’s as sexist as ever – something that didn’t seem to bother many in the crowd.\n\nThe town hall audience – selected on the basis of their intention to vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire – appeared to be made up mostly of Trump fans. The crowd generally cheered Trump and his sentiments disparaging whichever woman was in his crosshairs.\n\nThe targeting of Carroll was particularly egregious, considering that a jury just penalized Trump to the tune of $5 million for what they found to be his sexual abuse of Carroll and his defamation of her for calling her claims a “hoax” and a “con job.” At the town hall, he again denied Carroll’s claims, and then turned her into a joke, cruelly laying into her while his fans cheered and jeered.\n\nMany of those fans, of course, were women. There are a significant number of female voters, the overwhelming majority of them White, who are either so accepting of or so used to rank misogyny that they have no issue voting for a man who has boasted about grabbing women’s genitals and whom a jury believes is more likely than not a sexual abuser. And there are, of course, a greater number of men who find Trump’s misogyny excusable enough to cast their ballots in his favor – and even applaud him.\n\nTrump’s attacks on and ridicule of various women in such a short span of time were a harsh reminder of who he is. The question is whether voters in 2024, unlike so many in 2016, will care.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nScott Jennings: This is how Trump won in 2016\n\nTrump likely agreed to the CNN town hall to show he’s vigorous enough to handle the rigors of a campaign and ultimately another term in the White House. He surely wants to make a clear comparison to President Joe Biden, who rarely takes questions from the press and frequently struggles with prepared remarks. Polling has shown voters have significant concerns about Biden’s fitness for office, and Trump, should he become the GOP nominee, would benefit if the race was decided on those grounds.\n\nThere’s simply no contest between Trump’s ability to have a quick-paced back-and-forth with a reporter and Biden’s. On Wednesday night, he bullied his way through questions about the 2020 election, the Capitol riot on January 6 and this week’s judgment against him for defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWhile this may turn off most American voters — particularly critical suburban independents in swing states — it will thrill many Republican primary voters who love to see him bulldoze his way through questions from CNN and other mainstream outlets. The Republican-leaning audience in attendance was clearly pleased with what they heard.\n\nTo analyze this town hall, you have to understand that Trump speaks a language that is understood by his biggest supporters and most GOP primary voters but is not and has never been understood by the media or the Democrats.\n\nIt has never proven to be a language that can attract more voters in a national popular election. But he’s still the master of this language, which he invented back in 2016, and Wednesday’s engagement will be judged a complete success by his campaign as it tries to lock up the 2024 nomination.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nAshley Allison: Now is the moment to stop Trump\n\nAlert! This is not a test. Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and on Wednesday night there was an audience of voters applauding for him in New Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking to them, Trump wouldn’t say he regrets January 6. He wouldn’t say which country he wants to win the war – Russia or Ukraine. Trump wouldn’t say he would not sign a national abortion ban. He wouldn’t say he lost the 2020 election. Trump even thought the US should default on its debt.\n\nAmerican voters, say where you stand so the record will reflect it. This means you must be able to assert: There should not be a federal abortion ban. I stand with Ukraine. Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And January 6 was an insurrection based on lies. If you cannot say these things, you have betrayed your democracy.\n\nTo the majority of Americans who believe these truths, according to a Pew Research survey, say them out loud – proudly and constantly. Commit to put country over politics, democracy over tyranny, justice over abuse.\n\nThis is bigger than any political party. This is bigger than any one candidate. This is the moment to be a patriot and stop Trump from ever again serving as President of the United States.\n\nThat’s it. That is the clarion call. Alert!\n\nAshley Allison is the CEO of Turner Conoly Group. She is a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama and former senior aide to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nFrida Ghitis: If Trump wins, Putin will be happy and Ukraine will suffer\n\nWatching Trump once again disparage American democracy, it’s not particularly surprising to learn that if he became president again, he would not help Ukraine win the war to repel Russia’s brutal aggression and invasion of its territory.\n\n“We’re giving away so much equipment,” he lamented. And when pressed to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, Trump refused to answer.\n\nHe repeated his claim that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if he were president. The reality is likely quite the opposite.\n\nAs president, Trump delayed sending support that Ukraine was urgently requesting and Congress had already approved – and was impeached. His clashes with allies and the divisions he fomented likely gave Russian President Vladimir Putin the impression that NATO might not stand together to help Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump becomes president before the war is over, there is every chance that he could clog up the pipeline of support from the United States – the world’s leading democracy – for Ukraine, another democracy that is under brutal attack. And there is absolutely no doubt that he would reignite the clashes between the US and its NATO allies, which threatened to unravel an alliance that is now reinvigorated, with a new sense of mission, and a crucial role to play.\n\nTrump had already showed his cards on Ukraine in a recent interview with Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity that “Ultimately, [Putin] is going to take over all of Ukraine.” If Putin does erase Ukraine from the map, there is reason to believe Trump would not find that terribly objectionable.\n\nFrida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review.\n\nAlice Stewart: Trump needs to come up with better answers on abortion\n\nAbortion policy stood out at Trump’s town hall Wednesday night. He managed to tout his pro-life record without boxing himself into a corner on a federal abortion ban. While this is a strategic answer, it could prove to be problematic for Trump.\n\nWhen asked if he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected, Trump said he would “make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.”\n\nTrump is clearly playing to the general election audience.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, about two-thirds of adults believe abortion should be legal in all cases, while almost a third say it should be illegal. This play to the general election voters could cost him some GOP primary support.\n\nThere’s no question, the pro-life community considers Trump the most consequential president in American history on abortion. Evangelicals rallied in support of Trump for his commitment to appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who made history in overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nThe problem is, Trump’s past performance on protecting the sanctity of life is strong, but his future commitments are about to be put to test in the 2024 GOP primary. Other Republican primary candidates have committed to signing a federal abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. This policy distinction will not go unnoticed.\n\nSusan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America has indicated they will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to support at minimum a 15-week national standard on abortion.\n\nAn endorsement from SBA and other pro-life organizations is vital in a Republican primary. A states-only position on abortion is not acceptable for the pro-life movement. Trump may need to come up with a better answer to keep the pro-life community in his good graces.\n\nAlice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President.\n\nRaul A. Reyes: Trump’s words about family separation were chilling\n\nIn 2015, candidate Donald Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his improbable run for the presidency by referring to immigrants as “rapists” and criminals.\n\nIt seems that not much has changed in the years since – as the now-former president is unrepentant in his anti-immigrant views. In his CNN town hall on Wednesday, Trump claimed “people” were “coming in” after being released from prisons and mental institutions.\n\nThere is, in fact, no evidence that migrants are coming to the border from mental institutions or prisons. The former president also doubled down on his horrific (and unpopular) family separation policy at the border and reiterated his false claim that he built “hundreds of miles” of the border wall.\n\nTrump’s language regarding immigrants was not only divisive, it was – and is – dangerous. It seems that he has learned nothing about the power of his words to drive anti-Latino violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso in 2019. And any possibility of a return to the family separation policy, which was truly a dark time in US history, is absolutely chilling.\n\nSadly, based on applause, Trump’s ugly rhetoric seemed popular with his not-so-diverse audience at Saint Anselm College. Yet New Hampshire is hardly representative of the US overall, and Trump said nothing tonight that might win over new voters.\n\nKaitlan Collins fact-checked Trump vigorously, but this town hall often felt like a Trump rally. On immigration, as well as myriad other issues, Trump was entirely predictable and misleading. We have all seen this act before, and it’s really, really tired. If Trump’s campaign was hoping to gain any new supporters or showcase a new image for the former president, this evening represented a resounding failure to launch.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes.\n\nSE Cupp: This was a brutal reminder that Trump isn’t defeated\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m fairly dejected after watching Wednesday night’s Trump town hall in New Hampshire.\n\nOur job, as journalists, is to hold powerful people accountable and ask them tough questions. Our intrepid anchor Kaitlan Collins did just that. However, the premise is that the person in power on the receiving end of those questions will answer them. What Trump did was hijack a town hall to do what he always does – distract, deflect, lie, insult his opponents, insult his questioner and play to his base, who loves it all.\n\nWatching Trump do this for over an hour, as a clearly packed crowd of his supporters applauded and laughed at his lies and smears, was a brutal reminder that Trump is not defeated, he is not chastened nor is he irrelevant. It was also a warning that these kinds of events, however well-intentioned, are not in the best service of democracy, transparency, accountability or any of the other things good journalism efforts at.\n\nSE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.\n\nMondaire Jones: America is in greater danger than we thought\n\nThe audience reactions during CNN’s presidential town hall with Trump show that America is in greater danger than perhaps many of us thought.\n\nThe assembly of Republican and “undeclared” voters at St. Anselm College in the critical early primary state of New Hampshire stood behind Trump, raucously applauding the former president throughout the night despite the stream of falsehoods he uttered — including lies about the 2020 election being stolen.\n\nThey applauded when he said he would consider pardoning “a large portion” of the January 6 insurrectionists, whose violence he greatly downplayed. They also laughed when he mocked E. Jean Carroll, who won a civil lawsuit against him on Tuesday, with a federal jury finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.\n\nThese reactions show how entrenched Trumpism is within the Republican Party. The audience members who applauded Trump’s lies and immoral behavior on stage represent a Republican electorate that largely rejects widely disseminated, clear evidence contradicting what it wants to believe or — worse — knows is the truth and doesn’t care.\n\nMondaire Jones is a CNN political commentator and former Representative for New York’s 17th Congressional District. He also serves as a member of the US Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nGeoff Duncan: Trump is stuck in 2020, and so far the GOP is too\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage at Saint Anselm College as the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, but it’s clear that his mindset is still stuck in 2020.\n\nFrom accusing former Vice President Mike Pence of doing something “wrong” on January 6 to defending his “perfect” call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a defiant Trump dug in on the election denialism that has come to define his presidency. He refused to back down from the disproven claims that there was widespread election fraud in 2020, and even labeled January 6 a “beautiful day.”\n\nOn the major policy issues of the day – immigration, federal debt, abortion – he offered little, if anything, in the way of specifics. He barely took the time to remind voters about the rightful accomplishments of his presidency, like the significant tax cuts that were enacted in 2017.\n\nThe town hall comes at a perilous time for Biden, after a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the president’s approval ratings sinking into the mid 30s amid growing doubts about his fitness for office. But Trump squandered the opportunity to exploit Biden’s weaknesses, and instead of using the primetime appearance to appeal to swing voters in the suburbs, he played the base’s greatest hits.\n\nStill, Trump’s charisma and showmanship were undeniable. The crowd roared with applause at multiple moments. Thus far, it’s undeniable that Trump is the leader of the GOP pack.\n\nIf Republicans fall for his snake oil again, we have no one but ourselves to blame if we lose another election.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1009063/trump-mocks-and-criticizes-biden-at-rally-in-arizona', 'Headline': 'Trump mocks and criticizes Biden at rally in Arizona', 'Snippet': 'published 16 January 2022.

Then, she said, things went off the rails.\n\nLake compared her rival, Democrat Katie Hobbs, to Biden for her lack of visibility on the campaign trail, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nWhile Biden spent some of the 2020 campaign working from his basement because of COVID-19 concerns, Hobbs is equally underground, Lake suggested. “I call her ‘Basement Hobbs,’” she said.\n\nThe real attraction was Trump\n\nThe crowd at Bell Bank Park in Mesa had staying power.\n\nAs temperatures climbed to 88 degrees under an intense sun, the crowd showed few signs of thinning as people waited for Trump to arrive on stage. Packed, standing shoulder to shoulder, they waited nearly two hours after Lake had finished her speech. In the meantime, they were entertained by a soundtrack that ranged from ""Phantom of the Opera"" to Elvis to Hot Tramp.\n\nFor many of the thousands who attended Sunday, the draw was Trump more so than the Arizona candidates.\n\nAnn-Marie Villicana drove to the southeast Valley from Pasadena, Calif., with Robin Salzer on Saturday. A founder of LA Trump, a group that supports the former president, Villicana said she wanted to add to the enthusiasm for a strong Republican turnout in the midterms and particularly for Kari Lake.\n\nSalzer said he thinks frustration is bringing people out to events like this.\n\n“People are just fed up, and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” he said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Elgin and four friends flew in from Oregon, sporting their red and white Oregon Women for Trump T-shirts.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” she said.\n\nGet ready for lines at the polls Nov. 8\n\nAn informal survey of attendees as they waited for Trump’s arrival showed elections officials should prepare for lines at the polls.\n\nPerson after person leaning against the metal gates that hemmed in the crowd said they would vote at the polls on Nov. 8 because they don’t trust mail-in voting.\n\n“I like to see it go in,” one man said of watching his ballot get fed into the tabulation machine.\n\nTheir attitudes reflect increased skepticism about the reliability of early voting, or vote by mail, that has grown since the 2020 election.\n\nTrump alluded to that distrust in his talk.\n\n“Sometimes the mail-in ballots are just not as good as being out there on Nov. 8,” he said.\n\n“If you can, vote in person on election day,” Trump said. “Because it’s a lot harder for them to cheat.” He did not clarify who he was referring to.\n\nTrump said those who vote by mail risk getting a “potentially fake ballot.”\n\nThere is no evidence of that ever occurring in Arizona.\n\nIn the August primary, Republican voters showed an uptick in voting at the polls, although voting by mail remained by far the most popular form of voting, used by 85% of voters in Maricopa County.\n\nRepublic reporter Alison Steinbach contributed to this article.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/09/trump-arizona-kari-lake-blake-masters-election-rally/8209439001/', 'Headline': 'Trump in Arizona: Recap from Kari Lake, Blake Masters rally in Mesa', 'Snippet': ""The event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November's election.

Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar and Debbie Lesko, as well as GOP challengers Eli Crane and Kelly Cooper. Trump notably didn’t mention Rep. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who is the GOP nominee in a Tucson-area district.\n\nAfter doing so, Trump again turned to the dark imagery of an America in chaos because of Democratic policies. He complained of inflation and declining stocks, dead U.S. soldiers and wasted hardware in Afghanistan and with Ukraine at war.\n\n“We are a nation in decline,” Trump said near the end of his speech as sorrowful sounding music played. “We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke.”\n\n“But we are not going to allow this horror to continue,” he said. “It is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save this country.”\n\nBy the time Trump was ending his speech, many in the crowd already had walked away.\n\n— Ronald J.

Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, airing many of the grievances he has repeated for years, while also giving attention to Republican candidates that he is backing in the state.\n\n6:10 p.m.: Trump says World War III could happen soon\n\nThe planet could be on the verge of World War III, former President Donald Trump said Sunday, blaming the Biden administration for failing to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spiraling tensions over it.\n\nWith characteristic self-congratulation, Trump praised himself for being correct about “everything” but said he hopes he is wrong that another global war could be on the horizon.\n\n“We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine or we will end up in World War III, and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this, and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”\n\nTrump castigated Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a reliable vote for ill-considered legislation pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMore than 45 minutes into his remarks, Trump returned repeatedly to claims of a stolen election in 2020. He called 2020 a “rigged and stolen election.”\n\n“I ran twice. I won twice,” Trump said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen and Alison Steinbach\n\n5:55 p.m.: Trump claims predecessors took classified records\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unloaded on the FBI and accused his presidential predecessors over the criminal investigation of the documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe alluded to a third presidential run that won’t get derailed by what he views as politically motivated attacks on him.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is take us out so we can’t represent you if we decide to do that, but we’ll be making a decision very soon,” he said to rising cheers.\n\nTrump claimed that former President Bill Clinton took millions of classified records with him when he left office, and presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also improperly took records as well.\n\nClinton lost the nuclear codes and former President Jimmy Carter sent the nuclear codes to a dry cleaner, Trump said, adding that nothing happened in those matters.\n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the crowd chanted after Trump mentioned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept private from officials government emails.\n\n“They should give me back everything that was taken,” Trump said of the records taken by the FBI.\n\n“They plant documents,” he said of the FBI. Trump wondered aloud when the Clintons would face investigation and prosecution.\n\n“I don’t think they will do it, and I don’t think they should do it,” Trump said.\n\nDespite his complaints, Trump said the actions against him drove his poll numbers higher.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n5:30 p.m.: Trump starts speech with familiar topics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wasted no time on Sunday launching into familiar grievances and a bleak image of America without him in the White House.\n\nCiting the influx of illegal immigrants, soaring prices and arrests of people who oppose abortion, Trump hit President Joe Biden and Democrats generally for a country in turmoil.\n\n“These are incredible people. They’re being treated like terrorists,” Trump said, vaguely alluding to those who support him or conservative causes.\n\n“Nothing happens to antifa. Nothing happens to (Black Lives Matter). But look at what happens to patriots.

Hansen\n\n5 p.m.: Trump takes the stage in Mesa\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump started speaking to the crowd in Mesa just before 5 p.m. Sunday, about an hour later than scheduled. He started his remarks by repeating his false claim that he won Arizona in 2020 and went on the attack against Democrats.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Lake fires up crowd, but doesn\'t mention 2020 election\n\nRepublican candidate for Arizona governor Kari Lake, the former television news anchor, spoke for 18 minutes on Sunday — without once mentioning the 2020 election and the false claims about it that propelled her to political prominence.\n\nInstead, Lake painted her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs as an absent candidate who refused to debate her, while Lake has toured the state speaking directly to voters. She connected Hobbs to the Biden administration, claiming Hobbs would raise taxes on Arizonans already feeling the brunt of record-high inflation. Hobbs has said she does not plan to do so, and either candidate would need the Legislature’s agreement to change tax policy.\n\nLake repeatedly noted a discrimination case Hobbs was involved in while Hobbs was the Democratic leader in the state Senate. A Black female Democratic staffer proved to two juries she was discriminated against and fired in retaliation by Hobbs and others after raising an issue over her pay disparity.\n\nThose verdicts, Lake said, showed Hobbs had already embarrassed the state and should not lead it. Her attacks prompted cheers from the crowd.\n\n“They’re saying lock her up,” Lake said. “I think we should just vote her out, how’s that?”\n\nLake proved victorious in August’s four-way primary election with the backing of Trump, who remains polarizing in politics. And though claims about the 2020 election being stolen or corrupt are a hallmark of her campaign — she has said she wouldn’t have certified Biden’s win in the state two years ago — she didn’t mention them Sunday.\n\nInstead, she pledged a crackdown at the border to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking and talked about economic hardship facing Arizonans. In a new policy proposal, Lake said she would work to prohibit municipalities from collecting taxes on groceries and rent. Doing both would require the Legislature to pass a bill.\n\n“It is said hard times create strong men, well they create strong women too,” she said. “And this woman is ready to put an end to the hard times. Who is ready to step up with me?”\n\nThe crowd chanted back: “Kari! Kari! Kari!”\n\n4 p.m.: Finchem promises changes to voting if elected secretary of state\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem’s walk-on music at the Mesa rally was the theme from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" To further his Western bona fides, and to take a swipe at East Coast commentators who mock his western vibe, Finchem wore his cowboy hat and sported his “Sunday Go-To Meeting Tie.“\n\nHe launched into his familiar attack on his Democratic opponent for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from Fontes’ missteps during the 2020 Democratic presidential preference election to his support of all-mail voting to policy changes that were slapped down by court rulings.\n\n“Just follow the law” is his campaign mantra, and he said he will stick to the rules.\n\nAs secretary of state, Finchem said he will push for post-election audits in all 15 counties and disconnect Arizona from ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares voter information among states to ensure there is not double voting.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:40 p.m.: Masters continues to pound Kelly over border, drugs, crime\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued his aggressive attacks on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., saying he should have to attend the funerals of overdose victims killed by drugs that entered America from its porous borders.\n\nMasters rattled off a familiar list of complaints about current conditions: There are 300,000 people crossing the nation’s border each month, violent crime has soared in Phoenix since 2019 and fentanyl continues to kill Americans everywhere.\n\n“Mark Kelly has been radio silent about fentanyl for 22 months,” Masters said. That ended last week, Masters said, because he had a debate with Masters.\n\n“One month before Election Day, he says, ‘Uh oh. I better pretend to start doing something about fentanyl,’” Masters said, adding that 2,000 Arizonans have died from the drug in the past year.\n\n“I think Mark Kelly should have to attend the funerals. Let him look a grieving mother in the eye and he can explain to her why he failed to even lift a finger to secure our border,” Masters said.\n\nHis words extend attacks on Kelly that shot to prominence last week during the debate between the Senate candidates.\n\nMasters took the stage to “Danger Zone,” the song made famous in both installments of the movie “Top Gun” that is about Navy pilots. It would seem a curious choice. Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut, while Masters never served in the military.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n3 p.m.: Hamadeh, Lesko describe a country in turmoil\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona attorney general, characterized Arizona as on the front lines of defending America in a short speech at the rally in Mesa.\n\n“Arizona, we shocked the hell out of the establishment on Aug. 2, and are you ready to do it again?” Hamadeh said to loud applause.\n\nHamadeh said Democrats have harmed the country in the past couple years, citing inflation, drugs and “terrorists” crossing the border with Mexico, critical race theory in schools, censorship from big tech and Democrats who are “weaponizing the law and targeting patriots.”\n\n“Arizona is on the front lines of so many of the battles facing our country, and if we lose Arizona, we lose our country, but we’re not going to lose. We’re not going to lose because President Trump is still fighting for America,” he said.\n\nAs attorney general, Hamadeh said he would fight criminals, drug cartels and the federal government and “lock up some people and put handcuffs on them,” prompting cheers in the crowd of “lock them up.”\n\n“America has been down before, but America has never been out. The rest of the country is watching, they’re watching what we do right here in Arizona, because if we win, there’s still hope for America. And when we win, when we win, Arizona will lead America’s greatest comeback and never look back,"" he said.\n\nThe dark imagery was a theme among speakers.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., described a dystopian America on the verge of collapse in the hands of Democrats in her remarks Sunday.\n\nInflation, a “totally open border,” fentanyl and violent crime have surged under President Joe Biden with help from congressional Democrats, Lesko told the crowd in Mesa.\n\nAnd authorities have hounded Trump since he began his political career, she said.\n\n“They continue to go after President Trump for six years,” she said, also lamenting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to take away our rights” presumably during the pandemic.\n\n“If our country is going to survive, this has got to stop,” Lesko said.\n\n— Alison Steinbach and Ronald J. Hansen\n\n2:40 p.m.: Republicans rally with Katie Hobbs in Paradise Valley\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs held a brief news conference Sunday morning at Barry Goldwater Memorial Park in Paradise Valley to emphasize that Republicans should support her over rival Kari Lake.\n\nSeveral members of Hobbs’ “Republicans for Katie Hobbs Coalition” gathered with her at the park, which celebrates the state’s conservative icon who died in 1998 following five terms as a U.S. senator.\n\nKarie Dozer, a former spokesman for the late state Attorney General Grant Woods, said Goldwater would be “shaking his head in disgust” at how “crazy” Republican politics have become.\n\nKari Lake is “dangerous for Arizona,” said Mesa Mayor John Giles, and that’s why he — a Republican — was at the park with Hobbs and not at Trump’s rally in Mesa on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who support Secretary Hobbs care very deeply about the future of Arizona,” he said. “And that’s why we are putting our state above our party.”\n\nNovember’s election wasn’t between Republicans and Democrats, but “a choice between sanity and chaos,” he added.\n\nMonica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, describing herself as a former Republican, emphasized that the nation has “moved forward” under Biden.\n\nShe didn’t leave the party, she said — it left her when it began running “candidates operating from places of hatred, hubris and hostility rather than honesty, humility and humanity.”\n\nHobbs, repeating Giles’ statement about “sanity” and “chaos,” said the problem isn’t just that Lake “proudly accepts support from Nazis and spews dang conspiracy theories, it’s what she would actually do as governor.”\n\nHobbs then ran down a litany of Lake’s positions, including her support for a territorial-era anti-abortion law, baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, and surveillance cameras in public-school classrooms.\n\nLake’s entire platform “boils down into being a sore loser,” she said.\n\nOther Republicans at the event included former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana and former state legislator Steve May.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2 p.m.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears at rally\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., echoed the language of the Great Replacement theory popular with white nationalists in her message to Arizonans in Mesa on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking about illegal immigration, Greene said 5 million people have crossed the Mexican border with impunity from a derelict President Joe Biden.\n\n“Five million people from all over the world have crossed our borders,” Greene said. “Joe Biden’s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs, replacing your kids in school, and coming from all over the world they are also replacing your culture. That’s not great for America.”\n\nThe replacement theory is an idea first popular among white nationalists that Democrats want illegal immigrants to keep their party politically viable.\n\nSome Republicans have flirted with similar rhetoric to energize their base, which has long seen the border as dangerously porous.\n\nGreene has long pushed a nationalist message. Last year, Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., were briefly linked to creating an America First Caucus that was reportedly linked to preserving the nation’s Anglo-Saxon past and dramatically restricting the nation’s immigration laws. Both lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from the caucus idea after bipartisan pushback.\n\nBefore taking the stage, Greene predicted the shifting state of Arizona’s law on abortion rights would not play a significant role in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe state’s guiding law seems to have whipsawed between a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions and a law passed earlier this year that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDespite the conflicting rulings and the attention it brings back to the issue, Greene said it won’t have an impact on voting in Arizona.\n\n“I don’t think it’s distracting at all,” she told a reporter before taking the stage in Mesa. Instead, America-first themes, like those identified by Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters, will resonate with voters, she said.\n\nGreene said she is looking forward to Republicans winning back the House of Representatives after the November elections. When that happens, she said, she will be placed on the House Oversight Committee, where she plans to open investigations into Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s embattled son.\n\nGreene also said Big Tech will face scrutiny over its “collusion” with Democrats in 2020 to censor conservative voices.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:45 p.m.: Trump, Lake supporters travel from Arizona, out of state\n\nAs the prayer, pledge of allegiance and national anthem began shortly before 1:30 p.m., attendees were still streaming into the dirt lot at Bell Bank Park. Seats were filled in the relatively small area of floor seating and risers around the speaking platform.\n\nAfter the national anthem, a chant of “USA, USA, USA” rose through the crowd. Many wore Trump attire, some wore anti-Biden clothes, and lots wore red, white and blue apparel, including a few people draped in American or Arizona flags.\n\nA few people were carried out on stretchers; it was a hot and sunny afternoon.\n\n“We’re just real Trump people,” said Ann-Marie Villicana, who drove from Pasadena, California, on Saturday to see Trump on Sunday.\n\nVillicana said she founded LA Trump and was a delegate from California in 2016. One of her friends is working with Lake so she came out to show support.\n\n“Since we haven’t been able to get out to Arizona to help Kari Lake, we thought the least we could do was donate money, get great seats,” she said. She and Robin Salzer had VIP seats.\n\n“People are just fed up and I think that’s why you see the enthusiasm at these rallies,” Salzer said. “You see the enthusiasm of every demographic, regardless of race, gender, creed, even sexual persuasion, people are just fed up with the way this country’s going.”\n\nKathy Schafer of Chandler voted for Trump and is a big supporter but said she hadn’t gone to one of his events until Sunday.\n\n“I am brokenhearted that America is in the condition it’s in,” she said, adding that she’s concerned about issues like inflation, the 2nd Amendment and school curriculum.\n\nSchaefer was excited to hear from Trump and Lake in particular. “I’m 100% Trumpster, I’m 100% Kari Lake,” she said, wearing a Trump shirt and hat. She said the midterm election will be “honest” because so many more people are paying attention.\n\nMaria Foshay traveled from Rancho Cucamonga, California, to hear Trump speak. She hopes he’ll announce his next move during the speech, ideally that he’ll run for president again in 2024. Foshay wants to make sure the election is truthful, fair and with “no cheating.”\n\nKerry Josey of Mesa said Trump is “the face of the people,” adding that she’s been to three of his rallies. She’s concerned about whether the upcoming election will be truthful.\n\nKathy Elgin stood out in the sea of red-colored couture with her eye-catching Oregon Women for Trump-shirt. She and four friends flew in from Oregon for a quick turnaround trip solely for Trump.\n\n“We want him to know Oregon exists and Oregon loves him,” Elgin said.\n\nA resident of Salem, Elgin said Oregon was a red state “until we got mail-in voting.” Since then, she said, the state has turned blue and she doesn’t buy it.\n\nAn avid Trump follower, Elgin said she got a visit from FBI after returning from the Jan. 6 rally at the U.S. Capitol. She called the visit “audacious” explaining that she never witnessed any violence at the Capitol until she saw television footing.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, Eryka Forquer and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m.: Who is scheduled to speak at Trump rally in Mesa\n\nThe speaker list for Sunday\'s rally includes names familiar to Arizonans, as well as some of the more outspoken Trump advocates, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nTwo members of Arizona\'s congressional delegation are on board to address the rally: Republican representatives Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko.\n\nThey will join former Trump administration staffers Rich Grenell and Kash Patel, who were with Trump at a similar rally in Nevada on Saturday.\n\nGrenell served briefly as acting director of National Intelligence in 2020, while also holding the posts of U.S. ambassador to Germany and special presidential envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations.\n\nPatel was former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe event is a rally to support the Trump-endorsed candidates in November\'s election. Arizona candidates slated to speak are gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. U.S. Senate nominee Blake Masters, secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem and attorney general nominee Abe Hamedeh.\n\nThe speeches are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11 a.m.: Masters: \'This race is winnable\'\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters continued what amounted to a victory lap ahead of his rally with former President Donald Trump in Mesa later today.\n\nMasters appeared with Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News and made the case that his showing in Thursday\'s debate with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., had reversed the race.\n\n""I expected him to struggle to defend (his record in the Senate) and he did,"" Masters said of Kelly. ""All I had to do, Maria, was go out there and tell the truth. Explain to the people how Mark Kelly has kept our border wide open, how his votes for all the crazy trillions of dollars in spending have caused inflation.""\n\n""I think we had him on the ropes a little bit, and it\'s a huge vibe shift, a momentum shift for our campaign,"" he continued.\n\nAsked about the lack of financial investment from some conservative corners, Masters predicted, ""a lot more people are going to get involved.""\n\n""I think I showed people that this race is winnable, that I\'m a much, much better candidate than Sen. Kelly in that debate the other night.""\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n10 a.m.: Lake and Hobbs on national TV prior to Trump rally\n\nArizona’s candidates for governor appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation morning news show Sunday, just hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the state.\n\nThe former president wasn’t the focus of the discussion; instead, Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs and Republican nominee Kari Lake discussed their plans for border security, abortion and other issues, including Hobbs’ refusal to debate Lake.\n\nThe interviews, conducted separately and aired back to back, might be the closest equivalent to a debate a national audience will see this cycle. They highlighted the stylistic and policy differences of two women locked in a nationally watched race that most polls say is tied.\n\nLake has shifted from praising a near-total ban on abortion to saying she will follow the law. She did so again Sunday. Arizona has two conflicting laws on the books, but a court ruling Friday has allowed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks except for in medical emergencies to prevail.\n\nLake told CBS news correspondent Major Garrett the “law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey\'s law at 15 weeks, so we\'ll follow the law,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nGarrett likewise tried to pin down Hobbs’ position on abortion, which Lake has painted as extreme because Hobbs has repeatedly declined to say if there is a stage of pregnancy after which she thinks abortion should be prohibited. Pressed on that, Garrett asked Hobbs if an Arizona voter would be right to conclude that she does “not favor any specific week limit on abortion.”\n\n“I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it,” Hobbs replied.\n\nLake spent much of her interview talking about her plan to use state law enforcement as border patrol and deportation officers, an authority she’d seek using an untested legal theory that would buck decades of court precedent and likely lead to a lawsuit.\n\n“I hope that Joe Biden doesn\'t fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartel,” she said.\n\nLake didn’t mention Trump in her interview, perhaps a reflection of his unpopularity with voters nationally. Hobbs brought up the former president twice, attacking his record at the southern border and his false claims the 2020 election was “stolen,” which Lake has parroted.\n\nHobbs said Trump’s effort to build the border wall, the signature of his border policy, wasn’t finished and called on the Biden administration to “step up.”\n\nAsked why she wouldn’t debate Lake, and if her decision not to participate shortchanged voters of a chance to see how Hobbs would respond in a moment of duress, Hobbs shifted to Trump.\n\n“I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state,” Hobbs said, “when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent Kari Lake.""\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n9 a.m.: 17 visits and counting\n\nArizona\'s political preeminence seems like a given these days, but the red state-turned-purple battleground coincides almost perfectly with the political rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president found early enthusiasm for his America-first message in Arizona in 2015, and he never really stopped coming back.\n\nHis scheduled rally in Mesa will add to an Arizona total no president or presidential contender can rival, with big asterisks for Barry Goldwater and John McCain, who lived in the state while pursuing the White House.\n\nAccording to Republic research, Trump has made at least 17 visits since entering politics.\n\nThat is a list that began on July 11, 2015, with a stop in Phoenix that focused on immigration and helped set the tone for his upstart campaign.\n\nBy the end of the 2016 campaign, Trump made six more stops in Arizona. He carried the state by 3.5 percentage points, an unusually low margin in a state that had voted Republican in all but one presidential election beginning in 1952.\n\nTrump visited the state seven times in 2020. That included a Feb. 19, 2020, rally in Phoenix just weeks before the pandemic halted campaign visits for months.\n\nIn May 2020, Trump started to move about again, with a stop at a Phoenix Honeywell facility making respirator masks to cope with the health crisis and to discuss aid to Native Americans.\n\nHe wound up losing Arizona in 2020 by fewer than 11,000 votes, the smallest margin in the country.\n\nTrump made his first post-presidential visit to Arizona on July 24, 2021, at a Turning Point Action rally in Phoenix in which he saw firsthand the raucous reception to Kari Lake by Republicans.\n\nHe wrongly predicted the ongoing review of Maricopa County ballots would vindicate his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nThis year, Trump held a January rally in Florence, a pre-primary rally in Prescott Valley in July and is set now to again back his slate of Republicans on Sunday in Mesa.\n\n— Ronald J.

Among the dozen or so Trump supporters there who spoke to CNN, grand conspiracy theories – all of which have been debunked – about how the 2020 election was supposedly rigged (like through voting machines linked to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013) seem to have given way to more refined talking points that closely align with restrictive voting measures being enacted by Republicans across the country.\n\n“There’s a famous statement – ‘sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,’ ” Trump said in a video posted online Friday, underscoring how Republicans motivated by his election lies have sought to undermine the legitimacy of America’s elections. Arizona – which President Joe Biden carried in 2020, becoming the first Democrat to carry the state since 1996 – has been at the center of those efforts.\n\nIn Florence on Saturday, Trump showed exactly what kind of “vote counters” he approves of.\n\nSpeaking at his rally, Kari Lake, Trump’s pick for governor, said there were a few people she “would like to send right down to the prison here in Florence. Anybody who was involved in that corrupt, shady, shoddy election of 2020. Lock them up.”\n\nMark Finchem, an Arizona state representative whom Trump has endorsed to be the state’s top election official as secretary of state, has previously echoed QAnon-type conspiracy theories about election officials and continues to maintain that the vote in Arizona was stolen from Trump, which has been widely disproved. Even a partisan audit of results in Maricopa County, commissioned by state Senate Republicans, affirmed Biden’s victory in the county.\n\nFinchem has previously been linked to the Oath Keepers, a right-wing extremist group. Some of its members were charged last week with “seditious conspiracy” related to the US Capitol attack.\n\n“I look forward to the day that we set aside an irredeemably flawed election. That’s the election of 2020. With all the evidence we have, the Arizona election should be decertified with cause by the legislature,” Finchem said, repeating the former President’s lies from the podium at his rally Saturday.\n\nA year’s-long sustained attack on the integrity of American elections has paved the way to make candidates like these the natural choice in 2022 for Trump, who’s trying to exercise his influence over the GOP – including local election officials – at the same time he’s eyeing another bid for the White House in 2024. A recent Washington Post tally found that “at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump’s false claims are running for statewide positions that would give them authority over the administration of elections.”\n\nBut also at the Trump rally was rare praise for a Democrat.\n\n“She’s our representative, she represents the state, she is not along party lines, she’s what’s good for the country,” Robbie Kimsey, an Arizona voter and Trump supporter, said of Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nSinema, along with Sen. Joe Machin of West Virginia, is blocking the passage of a pair of voting rights bills that Democrats hope could counter some of the restrictive voting measures enacted by Republicans at the state level. Sinema has said she is supportive of the bills but not in favor of changing Senate rules to get them passed.\n\nThe opposition of these two moderate Democrats is frustrating voting rights activists, including those who gathered in Arizona this weekend.\n\n“She says she wants voting rights, but how do you want voting rights without creating a path for that to happen? That is inconsistent; that is unacceptable,” Martin Luther King Jr.’s son Martin Luther King III told CNN in Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nThe King family had traveled to Arizona to take part in a voting rights march, calling on Sinema to act – warning that history would not judge her kindly.\n\n“I think we are really at a defining moment,” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democratic hopeful for governor, told CNN.\n\nHobbs said democracy had prevailed in 2020 because election officials on both sides of the aisle had done their jobs – but now, with Trump-endorsed election deniers running for jobs that would give them authority over elections, the future is less certain.\n\n“The election in 2022, I think, is going to determine the future of our democracy,” Hobbs said.\n\nThat was a sentiment echoed by Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s 13-year-old granddaughter, who was with her family this weekend in Phoenix, telling CNN, “I think it’s so important to vote and it’s so important to have the right to vote, because right now our country is at stake.”'}}",92.5,1

His defense lawyers also argued that special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump had “significant overlap” with the House select committee’s investigation.\n\nWith the case slated to go to trial in March, Judge Tanya Chutkan is still considering several pretrial motions from Trump’s team, including long-shot motions to dismiss the entire case.

He said this summer that the committee wasn’t required to keep all of the records it amassed during the monthslong investigation, in response to accusations from Rep. Barry Loudermilk, currently overseeing a House Republican probe into the committee’s work, that certain records were missing.\n\nChutkan, in her ruling Monday, said Trump had not sufficiently justified his subpoena requests and did not establish relevance between the case and certain items he wanted to subpoena, including recorded interviews. The order also says that some of the requested material has already been provided to Trump’s team through discovery.\n\nIn addition, Chutkan noted that Trump’s requested subpoenas lacked specificity about certain information he wanted, comparing the request to a “fishing expedition.”\n\n“The broad scope of the records that Defendant seeks, and his vague description of their potential relevance, resemble less ‘a good faith effort to obtain identified evidence’” than they do a “fishing expedition,” Chutkan wrote.\n\nCNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': 'The panel voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump over his role.

With many of the committee’s staff already departed, remaining aides have spent the last two weeks releasing many of the panel’s materials, including its 814-page final report, about 200 transcripts of witness interviews, and documents used to support its conclusions.\n\nLawmakers said they wanted to make their work public to underscore the seriousness of the attack and Trump’s multi-pronged effort to try to overturn the election.\n\n“Accountability is now critical to thwart any other future scheme to overturn an election,” Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., wrote in a departing message on Monday. “We have made a series of criminal referrals, and our system of Justice is responsible for what comes next.”\n\nWATCH: Key member of Jan. 6 committee on recommendation of charges against Trump\n\nSome of the committee’s work — such as videotape of hundreds of witness interviews — will not be made public immediately. The committee is sending those videos and some other committee records to the National Archives, which by law would make them available in 50 years. Members of the committee said they didn’t release that videotape now because it would have been too difficult to edit it and redact sensitive information.\n\nIncoming Republican leaders may try to get those materials much sooner, though. A provision in a package of proposed House rules released Sunday calls for the National Archives to transfer “any records related to the committee” back to the House no later than Jan. 17.\n\nIt is unclear whether the GOP-led House could enforce the provision and what they would do with the materials.\n\nThe committee’s conclusion comes after one of the most aggressive and wide-ranging congressional investigations in recent memory. The panel formally or informally interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, collected more than 1 million documents and held 10 well-watched hearings. The two Republicans and seven Democrats on the panel were able to conduct the investigation with little interference after House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy declined to appoint minority members, angry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had rejected two of his suggested appointments.\n\nIn the end, the panel came to a unanimous conclusion that Trump coordinated a “conspiracy” on multiple levels, pressuring states, federal officials and lawmakers to try to overturn his defeat, and inspired a violent mob of supporters to attack the Capitol and interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s win. The panel recommended that the Justice Department prosecute Trump on four crimes, including aiding an insurrection.\n\nREAD MORE: Jan. 6 panel releases final report, alleges Trump engaged in ‘conspiracy’ to overturn election\n\nWhile a so-called criminal referral has no real legal standing, it is a forceful statement by the committee and adds to political pressure already on Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith, who is conducting an investigation into Jan. 6 and Trump’s actions.\n\n“This is the most intense investigation I’ve been involved in,” said California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who has been in the House for almost three decades and served as an aide to a member on the House Judiciary Committee in the 1970s when Congress was preparing to impeach then-President Richard Nixon. Lofgren was also in the House for former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and served as an impeachment manager during Trump’s first impeachment three years ago.\n\n“I have never been involved in anything as wide ranging and intense,” Lofgren said.\n\nREAD MORE: Key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee report summary\n\nShe said that at the beginning of the probe, she felt it would be a success if there was a renewed enthusiasm for protecting democracy. In the November midterm elections, 44 percent of voters said the future of democracy was their primary consideration at the polls, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate.\n\nLofgren said she believes the committee made clear that Trump was responsible for the insurrection and “it was not done at the last minute.”\n\n“I think we proved that and we sent it all to the Department of Justice,” Lofgren said. “We’ll see what they do.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-committee-public-meeting/index.html', 'Headline': 'Live updates: Jan. 6 committee votes to issue criminal referrals ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The Jan. 6 committee voted to approve its final report and the referral of multiple criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ during the panel’s final public meeting Monday.', 'Full_text': 'These are the key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee used its final public meeting Monday to summarize its 17-month investigation with a simple closing statement: All roads lead to Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe committee refers Trump to the DOJ\n\nFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. On Monday, the committee didn’t equivocate.\n\nThe committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary, released after the meeting, it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn practice, the referral is effectively a symbolic measure. It does not require the Justice Department to act, and regardless, Attorney General Merrick Garland has already appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take on two investigations related to Trump, including the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nBut the formal criminal referrals and the unveiling of its report this week underscore how much the Jan. 6 committee dug up and revealed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the lead-up to Jan. 6. Now the ball is in the Justice Department’s court.\n\nAll roads lead to Trump\n\nCommittee members repeatedly pointed to Trump’s personal involvement in nearly every part of the broader plot to overturn the 2020 election and focused squarely on his role in the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.\n\nMonday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.” Members stressed that Trump knew the election was not stolen but continued to push baseless claims about widespread voter fraud in an effort to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory.\n\nVisually reinforcing their argument\n\nThe committee relied once again on video — an effective and memorable tool the panel has used throughout its hearings with closed-door witness testimony and harrowing scenes from the violent attack on the Capitol, to make an its case against Trump.\n\nThe montage went step-by-step through Trump’s efforts to block his election loss, showed how his attacks upended the lives of election workers and played body-cam footage of officers attacked by rioters.\n\nA bipartisan, if one-sided, endeavor\n\nThough GOP lawmakers have called the committee partisan, the panel is, in fact, bipartisan.\n\nTwo Republicans who volunteered to join the committee: Rep. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They both brought GOP staff members along with them who worked for the committee.\n\nTo be sure, Cheney and Kinzinger are outliers in their caucus because they are anti-Trump. And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee — that it stacked with Trump haters. Still, even if they oppose Trump, Cheney and Kinzinger are still deeply conservative Republicans.\n\nNo matter what Trump and his allies say, Democrats will forever be able to accurately assert that the panel’s findings, conclusions, its final report and its criminal referrals are bipartisan.\n\nRead more takeaways here\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee had its last public meeting today. Here\'s what happens next.\n\nThe end is near — at least for the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe panel held its final public session Monday where it voted on its final report and approved a criminal referral for several charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSo here’s what happens next: Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the full report will come out Wednesday. This will be a historical document that will be studied for generations — never before has a sitting president tried to steal a second term.\n\nAdditional “transcripts and documents” will be released before the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nThe sheer volume of this material can’t be overstated. The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, likely generating tens of thousands of pages of transcripts. Many of these interviews were filmed, which means the panel has hundreds of hours of footage that it might release very soon.\n\nThese upcoming releases will provide fodder to Trump’s critics. But it will also grant a key demand from some of Trump’s allies — that the panel disclose the full context of its interviews. Up until this point, the panel has been very selective about which snippets of witness interviews got played at public hearings.\n\nThe current Congress ends on January 3, 2023, and that’s when the committee will cease to exist. But the Justice Department investigation, overseen by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, continues.\n\nOf the committee’s nine members, four won’t be returning to Congress. Besides Republican vice-chair Rep. Liz Cheney and Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida is retiring, and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia was one of the handful of House Democratic incumbents who lost their seats in the 2022 midterms last month.\n\n""We ended up in the middle"": Rep. Jamie Raskin explains how the committee made criminal referral selections\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the subcommittee of the Jan. 6 select committee responsible for presenting criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, laid out how panel members arrived at the decisions presented during Monday’s final public session.\n\nAsked about process offenses, such as witness tampering or perjury, Raskin said “as evidence is assembled about that, I hope that those will be charged as well. You cannot suborn perjury, you cannot obstruct justice, you cannot interfere with a congressional proceeding.” However, Raskin did not specify who these potential charges related to in the panel’s investigation.\n\nIn terms of unanswered questions left by the committee, Raskin was asked if the panel ever solved the situation with the pipe bombs on Jan. 6 and said, “I don’t believe there have been any updates since we first looked int to. Those are unsolved crimes.”\n\nIn pictures: Scenes from the last public Jan. 6 committee meeting\n\nCheck out photos from the last Jan. 6 hearings here.\n\nCommittee members Schiff and Raskin explain why more Trump associates were not referred to the DOJ\n\nJan. 6 committee members, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Adam Schiff, explained that more associates of former President Donald Trump were not directly referred to the Department of Justice because the committee wanted to focus on those with “abundant evidence” against them.\n\nRaskin noted that the DOJ will receive the full report and can decide if anyone else discussed merits further investigation.\n\n“We wanted to proceed in such a way that we could all feel certain that these were people where evidence exists that they engaged in criminal offenses against our country,” he added.\n\nSchiff said, “The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that up until this release, the Justice Department may not have, they possess evidence that we don’t have, and the cumulative impact of all that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those that have broken the law here.”\n\nRaskin promised that they would cooperate with the Justice Department “quickly,” while Schiff added that the committee expects evidence will start to be made available to both the DOJ and the public starting Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain why those four House Republicans were referred to House Ethics in particular, Schiff pointed out that these four failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, which is easier to prove.\n\nHere\'s a recap of what happened at the Jan. 6 committee\'s final public session\n\nAfter extensive investigation, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol held its final public meeting Monday where they voted on their final report and approved a series of criminal referrals — including against former President Donald Trump and others in his orbit.\n\nThe final report is expected to be released publicly Wednesday.\n\nHere are the key things that happened at the committee’s last public session:\n\nTrump’s role in the events of Jan. 6: The committee announced it will refer several criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including obstructing an official proceeding, defrauding the United States, making false statements and assisting or aiding an insurrection.The DOJ special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into Jan. 6. The referrals are largely symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes.\n\nFinal report: Members voted to approve their final report, which will include a bulk of results from the 17-month investigation, chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said during his opening remarks. An executive summary of the report was released after Monday’s meeting, but the full report won’t be available to the public until Wednesday.\n\nA spanning investigation: During the meeting, the committee played a video summarizing its investigation. Since its formation in July 2021, the panel conducted more than 1,000 interviews as well as issued subpoenas and court battles to obtain hundreds of thousands of documents. The committee said the evidence shows that Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nClosing remarks from the committee: Though its investigation is coming to a close, Thompson reiterated the importance of preventing another insurrection from happening again, for the sake of American democracy. “I believe nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” Thompson said the most important thing in preventing another event like Jan. 6 is accountability. The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, said Trump was “unfit for any office.”\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 were sitting in the front row during committee meeting\n\nAs the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 riot held its last public meeting, the room was packed.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who testified at the panel’s first public hearing last July about the violence they experienced defending the US Capitol on Jan. 6 sat in the front row, as they have for every public event the committee has had.\n\nThose officers include: US Capitol Police (USCP) officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, former USCP Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.\n\nFanone sat in the audience as the panel replayed his testimony about being attacked as the riot unfolded.\n\nA number of committee staff and investigators — and even former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, who has publicly supported the panel’s work — were in the audience as well.\n\nThe meeting took place in the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caucus Room which was recently renamed to honor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who stepping down as speaker at the end of the this Congress.\n\nIn previous hearings, it was typical to see a committee staffer sitting at the dais with the members. But for today’s meeting, it was just the nine committee members at the dais, each taking turns speaking.\n\nJan. 6 committee chair says he\'s ""convinced"" Trump will be charged by DOJ with help of panel\'s evidence\n\nJan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson said the evidence that supports the panel’s decision to refer former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department for several criminal charges is “clear,” adding that he is “convinced” that the DOJ will ultimately charge Trump.\n\n“The committee looked at it long and hard, and from my vantage point, we couldn’t do anything except make the referral,” Thompson told CNN after Monday’s meeting, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the referral.\n\n“It was clear in the evaluation of the evidence uncovered by our committee that those actions taken by the president… former President Trump, clearly created a problem for this country,” he added.\n\nThe committee also voted to approve its final report which will be released to the public Wednesday. That report will contain most of the evidence from the 17-month long investigation — including full transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews.\n\n“We think it’s important for the Justice Department to look at that body of information that we put together,” he said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1c447b21-7492-487d-bf20-bbd9f8559559.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nKellyanne Conway testified that Trump described rioters as ""upset"" the day after the attack\n\nTrump “minimized the seriousness of the attack” in the days following the riot, Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Elaine Luria said, specifically citing testimony that Trump’s former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway gave to the committee.\n\nAsked to describe her conversation with Trump the day after the riot, Conway, said she didn’t think it was very long. “I don’t think it was very long. I just said that was just a terrible day.”\n\nTrump, Conway said, responded to her saying, “These people are upset. They’re very upset.”\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump similarly described rioters as being “upset” during a heated phone call he had with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy while the insurrection was underway, claiming the rioters cared more about the election results than the California Republican did.\n\n“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.\n\nTrump’s comment set off what GOP lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told Trump the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked, “Who the f–k do you think you are talking to?” according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.\n\nTrump was warned of violence before Jan. 6, but refused to encourage peaceful protest\n\nIn the lead up to Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump ignored warnings from advisors about the potential for violence and rejected any suggestion that he should explicitly tell supporters to be peaceful, Rep. Stephanie Murphy said Monday.\n\nMurphy pointed to a text message exchange provided to the committee by Hope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director. In the exchange, Hicks and then White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley discussed getting Trump to tweet out a message to his supporters. Gidley texted Hicks that Trump “really should tweet something about Being NON-violent.”\n\nHicks responded that she had already “suggested it several times” without success.\n\n“Mr. Herschmann said that he had made the same recommendation directly to the President and that he had refused,” Hicks said in her interview with the committee, a video of which was played Monday.\n\nDespite his staff’s warnings, Murphy said, Trump took to the stage on Jan. 6, 2021, and encouraged his supporters to “fight like hell,” and sent them marching to the Capitol building.\n\nNOW: Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral against Trump and other officials\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is outlining criminal referral it plans to make against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department and other officials.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee would refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, told CNN last week that a subcommittee of members would make recommendations to the full committee about various referrals.\n\nThe full committee is now expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nRemember: A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case. With the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nJan. 6 committee concerned lawyer took part in attempt to keep truth from them, Lofgren says\n\nHouse Jan. 6 committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed during Monday’s public meeting that an unnamed lawyer appeared to have attempted to shape the testimony of one witness in a way that could help Donald Trump.\n\nLofgren noted a lawyer suggested that the witness not share some memories during her testimony to the committee, that she couldn’t learn who was paying for her lawyer, and that Trump-allied entities offered to keep her under their wing as her testimony neared.\n\nAs it became clear what the witness would say, Lofgren added, the job offers evaporated.\n\nLofgren didn’t name the lawyer or the female witness, and it’s not clear if all of the examples are about one witness.\n\nIt’s not unusual or illegal for lawyers to take money from motivated backers to pay for witnesses to be represented. But lawyers must follow strict ethics guidelines, governed by their state bars and enforced by the courts. The House select committee previously shared their concerns about potential witness influence with the Justice Department.\n\nFormer Trump aide Hope Hicks describes conversation with Trump saying the only thing that matters is winning\n\nIn a new video clip played by the House Jan. 6 committee, Hope Hicks, who previously served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump, referenced the baseless claims of election fraud and said: “I was becoming increasingly concerned that … we were damaging his legacy.”\n\nTrump “said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,’” Hicks said in the clip.\n\nThe committee played the clip after Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Trump was repeatedly told there was no evidence to back up his false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and the panel “has obtained testimony from new witnesses who have come forward to tell us about their conversations with ex-President Trump on this topic.”\n\n“Donald Trump knowingly and corruptly repeated election fraud lies, which incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6. He continues to repeat his meritless claim that the election was stolen even today, and continues to erode our most cherished and shared belief in free and fair elections,” Lofgren later continued.\n\nKinzinger calls out fellow Republicans for their role in Trump’s DOJ schemes\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the the Jan. 6 committee, accused former president Donald Trump of trying to abuse the powers of the Justice Department so he could stay in office.\n\nKinzinger described how Trump wanted top Justice Department officials to publicly endorse his false claims about massive voter fraud. As part of the plan, Trump wanted them to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” according to committee testimony.\n\nA retiring Republican, Kinzinger called out his fellow GOP lawmakers. He also specifically name-dropped Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who was involved with some of Trump’s scheming at the Justice Department.\n\nWhen then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to go along with Trump’s plan, Trump almost fired him and replaced him with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump loyalist at DOJ who embraced his election lies.\n\n“It was only after the threat of mass resignations that President Trump rescinded his offer to Mr. Clark,” Kinzinger said.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ncc4283b8-e6ad-44ea-8cac-93d9dcbf8029.mp4\n\n04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump ""oversaw"" legally dubious fake electors plot, Jan. 6 committee says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump “oversaw” an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College certificates, tying him directly to a core tenet of the broader plot to upend Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in key swing states, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said Monday.\n\nThe panel highlighted Trump’s personal involvement in the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”\n\nThose certificates, which surfaced publicly earlier this year, helped spark criminal investigations into the Trump team’s attempt to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nAs part of its closing message Monday, the select committee emphasized that these “false ballots” were created despite concerns among Trump’s election lawyers and White House counsel that doing so may be “unlawful.”\n\n“In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,” he added.\n\nThe committee has evidence that shows these “intentionally false” Electoral College certificates were “transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government,” according to Schiff.\n\nEvidence collected by the committee also shows these documents “were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called ‘competing slates’ of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” he added.\n\nCheney: Trump ""is unfit for any office""\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, issued a scathing rebuke of former President Donald Trump during her opening remarks on Monday, saying he is unfit for office based on his actions regarding Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“At the beginning of our investigation, we understood that tens of millions of Americans had been persuaded by President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen by overwhelming fraud. And we also knew this was flatly false. We knew that dozens of state and federal judges had addressed and resolved all manner of allegations about the election,” Cheney said. “Our legal system functioned as it should. But our president would not accept the outcome. Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nShe went on to describe how Trump was unmoved by “urgent pleas” from people around him to “issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol,” even as rioters attacked law enforcement officials and halted the electoral count.\n\n“In addition to being unlawful as described in our report, this was an utter moral failure, and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney added.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: ""At the heart of our Republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power""\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, said the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power is “at the heart of our Republic.”\n\nShe added: “Trumbull called this ‘one of the highest moral lessons ever given the world.’ With this noble act, George Washington established the indispensable example of the peace transfer of power in our nation.”\n\nShe traced this orderly transfer of power through every president of the United States until former President Donald Trump refused his constitutional duty.\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nfb900dba-c57b-4545-9654-1fd8f5848d90.mp4\n\n05:07 - Source: CNN\n\nThompson: It\'s up to the people of America to decide who deserves the public\'s trust\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said that the future of democracy rests on the hands of the American public during his opening statement at Monday’s public meeting.\n\nHe also thanked the American public for tuning into the committee’s hearings and said that he hoped that the evidence presented lived up to their expectations.\n\n“I’m grateful to the millions of you who followed this committee’s work. I hope we lived up to our commitment to present the facts — and let the facts speak for themselves,” Thompson said.\n\nHe continued, “Let me say in closing, the women and men seated around me on this dais are public servants in the most genuine sense. They put aside politician and partisanship, to ensure the success of this committee, and providing answers to the American people.”\n\nThompson specifically thanked Republican Rep. Liz Cheney for her participation. “I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, who has become a true partner in this bipartisan effort, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming.”\n\nAmerica is still in a time of ""reflection and reckoning"" nearly 2 years after Jan. 6, chairman says\n\nJan. 6 committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said the panel’s findings show that former President Donald Trump was responsible for the insurrection at the US Capitol and that there is still “reckoning” left to do, nearly two years later.\n\n“We remain in strange and uncharted waters,” Thompson said, as the committee comes to the close.\n\nIn opening statements to the committee’s final public session, Thompson said Americans show faith in elected officials that they will abide by laws and uphold elected results.\n\n“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” he said. “Donald Trump broke that faith. He lost the 2020 election and knew it, but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme to overturn the results and block the transfer of power.”\n\n“In the end, he summoned a mob to Washington,” he said, adding that their findings show Trump knew they were “armed and angry.”\n\nThompson said the committee intends to make the bulk of its results public in the form of its final report, expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nAlong with adopting its final report on Monday, the committee is also expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, CNN previously reported.\n\n“So, today, beyond our findings, we will also show that evidence we’ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee, or the Congress, to help ensure accountability under law,” he added.\n\n“Accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system. We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice,” he said.\n\nThompson didn’t announce the criminal referrals in his opening statement but said that the panel has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nNOW: The Jan. 6 committee has started its final public meeting\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has begun its final public meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to announce criminal referrals to the Justice Department and Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has said the panel will approve its final report at the meeting. It won’t be made public until Wednesday. Members of the committee have promised to release the report before the end of the year since Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nThe meeting — which, unlike previous gatherings of the committee, is not a hearing with witnesses — will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals, Thompson said last week.\n\nCNN previously reported the committee will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the events on and leading up to the insurrection since the panel was formed in July 2021.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee’s final public session is starting soon. Here are key things to watch for.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will soon hold its last public meeting, marking the end of an expansive investigation that has spanned more than 17 months, encompassed more than 1,000 interviews and culminated in accusations that former President Donald Trump and his closest allies sought to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThrough blockbuster hearings, interviews with some of the former president’s closest allies and court battles to free up documents, the committee sought to tell the definitive narrative of what happened in the lead up to and on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Monday, members are expected to vote on its final report – spanning hundreds of pages and encapsulating its key findings, which will be released to the public on Wednesday – as well as present criminal referrals it plans to make to the Justice Department. This meeting will be the panel’s last message to the public, and members are seeking to end on a powerful note.\n\nThe charges the panel is considering asking DOJ to pursue include multiple against Trump, such as obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe recommendations match the allegations the House select committee made against Trump and his elections attorney John Eastman in a previous court proceeding seeking Eastman’s emails.\n\nThe final House report could include additional charges proposed for Trump, according to the source. It will provide justification from the committee investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nThe panel is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to Trump, CNN has reported: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the Jan. 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full panel, recently said that “the gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order. Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprised the subcommittee tasked with providing the full panel with referral recommendations that will be adopted on Monday.\n\nTrump\'s team braces for criminal referrals while he lashes out on social media, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team huddled together multiple times since they learned the committee would be issuing criminal referrals — attempting to prepare for what they believed going to happen —a criminal referral from the House Select Committee to the Department of Justice.\n\nSources close to Trump said much of his inner circle were not ignoring the committee’s actions, despite many around the former president brushing it off as political.\n\nMany of his top advisers spent time on the phone with legal counsel, trying to get a deeper understanding of what exactly criminal referrals would mean and how to plan a response.\n\nWhile some aides said Trump was unbothered by the committee, the former president spent the weekend fixated on their actions.\n\nIn a flurry of social media posts on Truth Social, Trump called the committee names, accused them of “illegally leaking confidential info” and hitting individuals sitting on the committee.\n\nHe also posted copies of tweets from the afternoon on Jan. 6, calling for protestors to be “peaceful.” During the Jan. 6 hearings, former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews testified that she was told Trump did not want to include any mention of “peace” in his tweets, but ultimately gave in to White House officials and advisers urged the former president to do more as the violent attack was unfolding.\n\nThe criminal referrals are just the latest in a long line of legal battles Trump is facing as he ramps up his third presidential campaign.\n\nToday\'s committee meeting is expected to have a ""simple and sober"" tone\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out its evidence and criminal referrals today, lawmakers are expected to hit a sober tone, sources say.\n\nToday’s meeting is expected to be relatively brief with some multimedia presentations.\n\nUnlike previous hearings that relied on compelling witness testimony and splashy video montages, today’s event is designed to drive home the key evidence the committee uncovered and the gravity of what transpired in the run up and on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Nobody’s spiking the football here,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member, told CNN just ahead of the committee meeting.\n\nJan. 6 committee treating release of executive summary and today\'s meeting as a roadmap for DOJ, sources say\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is treating today’s public meeting and the release of its executive summary as a “roadmap” for the Department of Justice, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee intends to lay out its body of evidence and drive home its conclusion that former President Donald Trump was culpable for the events that transpired on Jan. 6, 2021 — the basis for its plans to refer Trump to DOJ on at least three criminal charges.\n\nLawmakers are primarily focused on laying out their case for DOJ, but their wide-ranging investigation has uncovered information that congressional investigators believe could be relevant to various bodies — from state bars to the House ethics committee.\n\nCongressional investigators have already provided what they believe is evidence of criminal activity to an Atlanta-area district attorney leading a criminal investigation into Trump and his allies, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\n\nTrump legal team mired in disagreements as he faces criminal referral\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee is expected to issue a criminal referral for former President Donald Trump, his legal team has continued to be bogged down in internal disagreements about the many probes facing him.\n\nTrump’s team has met to talk about what to expect from the committee today, but they are much more focused and concerned with the other investigations facing him, including the federal grand jury on Jan. 6, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation and the special grand jury in Georgia, multiple people familiar with the workings of the team say.\n\nDespite the many probes facing Trump, his team is not acting as a unified front, but has often been locked in serious disagreement over how to proceed on several of the investigations, mainly when it comes to the documents one.\n\nOne thing Trump’s advisers will watch for today is how deep the referrals from the committee go and whether it mentions obstruction of the investigation when it pertains to Trump.\n\nTrump advisers and aides will be watching the meeting today closely, however sources close to Trump said the former President has told them he does not plan on watching.\n\nHowever, he will be updated by people around him, as he has been for all of the public hearings thus far.\n\nAs of now, Trump’s legal team will not be engaging in the response to the committee today, however sources stress that this could change as the public meeting unfolds.\n\nThese are the crimes the Jan. 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, they include:\n\nInsurrection\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy to defraud the federal government\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred? The panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRep. Schiff: Jan. 6 committee considering how to handle uncooperative GOP lawmakers\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said Sunday the panel is considering how to hold accountable the GOP lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.\n\nSchiff said the committee would be considering this on Monday, noting that the panel has weighed whether it is better to criminally refer members of Congress to other parts of the federal government or if Congress should “police its own.” Such congressional mechanisms could include censure and referrals to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nFive House Republicans have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 panel: GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe select committee is set to hold its final public hearing today and release its full report on Wednesday. The panel is expected to announce it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe impact House referrals could have remains unclear because the Department of Justice special counsel investigation is already examining Trump in its extensive probe into the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut in addition to criminal referrals, Jan. 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told reporters that the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\n“Censure was something that we have considered. Ethics referrals is something we have considered,” Schiff said Sunday, noting that the committee will disclose its decision Monday.\n\nCNN previously reported that the panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies, including former Trump attorney John Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhy today\'s Jan. 6 committee session is a meeting and not a hearing\n\nNearly two years removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with finding out exactly what happened is about to show its hand.\n\nThe panel will hold its final public meeting on Monday, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike previous gatherings of the committee, Monday’s is a business meeting rather than a hearing as no witnesses are set to testify.\n\nWhat to expect from the session: The public meeting, scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET, is expected to see the panel announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee will release an executive summary of the investigation’s report on Monday after the meeting, a committee aide said Sunday. The final report, to be released two days later, will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nWhy now? Republicans are expected to dissolve the panel when they take over the House in January.\n\nA recap of what unfolded in the Jan. 6 committee\'s hearing in October\n\nThe House select committee’s October hearing on the Capitol Hill insurrection used testimony and evidence to demonstrate how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHere’s a recap of what unfolded at the hearing:\n\nThe committee voted to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony.\n\nPreviously unseen footage aired from the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection.\n\nElaine Chao, who resigned from her post as Trump’s secretary of Transportation a day after the insurrection, spoke in personal terms about her disgust toward the attack when she testified. “I think the events at the Capitol, however they occurred, were shocking,” she said.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election.\n\nThe panel revealed some of what they had learned from the 1 million Secret Service records obtained within roughly three months since the last January 6 committee hearing.\n\nThe committee revealed new evidence that Trump had devised a plan, well before any votes were counted, to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the panel’s hearing in October.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHere\'s what the Jan. 6 committee chair said about the referrals the panel will announce Monday\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters last week that the panel will make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department in Monday’s meeting.\n\nWhat this means: Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n\nCommittee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, sources have told CNN.\n\nThompson told CNN that the panel is looking at five to six categories of referrals beyond those deemed criminal, but has not decided on the specific number of individuals.\n\nThompson said that in addition to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, there could be other categories of referrals the committee makes such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nThompson told reporters last Tuesday that Monday’s public meeting will include a presentation and cover the names of people facing criminal and other referrals, as will as the basis for those referrals.\n\nA subcommittee of members has made recommendations to the full committee about various referrals. During the public meeting, the full committee is expected to vote on adopting the subcommittee’s recommendations.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the committee is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump,\n\nA reminder of the key events that unfolded during the Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to lay out its findings in a final report. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of the committee’s probe since the panel formed in July 2021.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nWhy the committee is wrapping up its investigation\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, told reporters the committee will hold its final public meeting on Monday and that the panel’s full report will come out December 21.\n\nThompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the committee will approve the panel’s final report on Dec. 19 and make announcements about criminal referrals to the Justice Department, but the public will not see the final report until two days later.\n\n“We will do all of the business of the committee on the 19th,” Thompson said, which includes voting on the final report.\n\nMembers of the committee have promised to have the committee’s report released before the end of the year, as Republicans are expected to dissolve the committee when they take over the chamber in the next Congress.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe other notable investigations Trump faces\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy, is facing a myriad of legal issues, alongside his business and allies.\n\nAside from the Jan. 6 committee’s probe, here are some other notable investigations involving Trump:\n\nTax returns.The House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House. The committee’s chairman, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\n2020 Election. The Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period. While DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The probe was launched following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nTrump Organization. New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nRead more about other investigations here.\n\nThese are the 9 members on the Jan. 6 committee\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. Now they are getting ready to present their findings in a final report.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the committee.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nChair: Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California\n\nRep. Elaine Luria of Virginia\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California\n\nRepublicans\n\nVice chair: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nHere\'s what a criminal referral is — and what it means for the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is set to make announcements at its final public meeting on Monday about criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nSo what is a criminal referral? A referral represents a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the Jan. 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEx-police officer who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 says he wants to see DOJ indict Trump\n\nMichael Fanone, a former DC police officer and CNN law enforcement analyst, told CNN he would like to see the referrals from the Jan. 6 committee lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFanone was beaten by rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\n“I would like to see those individuals put on trial and then again, as I’ve said many times, as Americans we should accept the results of those trials, even if it includes a guilty verdict for former President Donald Trump and jail time,” he said.\n\nFanone also said he is “hopeful” the Justice Department will bring an indictment against Trump.\n\nThe White House is expected to watch quietly as Jan. 6 committee delivers final report this week\n\nWhen the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol delivers its ultimate conclusion to the public this week – holding a final public meeting on Monday and announcing expected criminal referrals to the Justice Department, followed by the release of its full report on Wednesday – the White House is expected to watch quietly and decline to offer judgment on any recommendations that the panel may make to the Justice Department.\n\nFor much of the year, top White House officials have made painstaking efforts to avoid delivering specific commentary on the panel’s work. There was one goal in particular of utmost urgency: staying clear of any moves that might suggest that the White House was trying to exert influence on the DOJ.\n\nAnd those efforts are likely to become even more imperative for the Biden White House after the committee refers at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump to the DOJ, as a source familiar with the matter said the committee was expected to do this week.\n\nOne White House official told CNN ahead of the committee’s upcoming last meeting on Monday that it would continue to not weigh in on any potential referrals or actions that the panel may take. Another official said this would be in line with the White House’s efforts this year to avoid “running pundit” on the panel’s work.\n\nBut officials also noted that President Biden himself has been clear in his public remarks about the significance of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the importance of the committee’s work, not to mention his rejection of last year’s insurrection and the threats to the country’s democratic systems.\n\nIndeed, Biden made that a central theme of his political message in the lead-up to the midterm elections – that decision drew criticism from some fellow Democrats who argued he needed to have a nearly singular focus on the economy, but ultimately left the White House feeling vindicated after Democrats far outperformed expectations.\n\nAnd in the rare moments that Biden did directly comment on the committee, he made clear that he believes the members are doing work critical to documenting history.\n\n“It’s important the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6 remain at work today,” Biden said this summer.\n\nIn October, following a hearing that revealed evidence and testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchison who said Trump continued efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election even though he knew he had lost reelection, Biden described the testimony and video as “absolutely devastating.”'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-report-executive-summary-key-findings-trump/', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 committee ...', 'Snippet': 'McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/19/us/jan-6-committee-trump', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 Committee Report and Hearing: Jan. 6 Committee Refers Former ...', 'Snippet': 'The criminal referrals were a major escalation for a congressional investigation that is the most significant in a generation.

The panel named five other Trump allies — Mark Meadows, his final chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro — as potential co-conspirators with Mr. Trump in actions the committee said warranted Justice Department investigation. The charges, including a fourth for Mr. Trump of conspiracy to make a false statement, would carry prison sentences, some of them lengthy, if federal prosecutors chose to pursue them.\n\nThe committee’s referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by the Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation into Jan. 6 and the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies leading up to the attack. But the referrals sent a powerful signal that a bipartisan committee of Congress believes the former president committed crimes.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the referrals.\n\nMr. Trump attacked the committee as “highly partisan” ahead of a final meeting the panel held on Monday to release an executive summary of its final report on the Capitol attack and to vote on referring the former president to the Justice Department.\n\n“It’s a kangaroo court,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “The Dan Bongino Show.” “The people aren’t going to stand for it.” He elaborated on that theme in a post on Truth Social, his social media network, after the meeting.\n\n“These folks don’t get it that when they come after me, people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me,” he said, adding that he “told everyone to go home” on Jan. 6, but leaving out his hours of inaction before that while a mob of his supporters rampaged through the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans, who have vowed to investigate the committee after they take control of the House in January, mounted a modest response. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of the few to react with a statement, accusing the committee of staging a “partisan charade.” She promised that Republicans “will hold House Democrats accountable for their illegitimate abuse of power.”\n\nThe executive summary, a 154-page narrative of Mr. Trump’s relentless drive to remain in power after he lost the 2020 election by seven million votes, identifies co-conspirators who aided Mr. Trump. But it singles out the former president as the primary cause of the mob violence.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the summary stated. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary closely follows the evidence from the committee’s 10 previous public hearings, but the facts have been assembled into a readable narrative that amounts to an astonishing story of Mr. Trump’s efforts to effectively overthrow the government he led. The committee is expected to release a lengthy final report on Wednesday.\n\n“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and vice chairwoman of the committee, said at the start of the meeting.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said of Mr. Trump: “Nothing could be a greater betrayal of this duty than to assist in insurrection against the constitutional order.”\n\nThe summary and referrals have now set up a dynamic without parallel in the annals of American campaigns: Congress asking the Justice Department of an incumbent president to consider criminal charges against the president’s potential opponent in the next election. President Biden has indicated his intent to run in 2024, and Mr. Trump announced his re-election campaign last month.\n\nThe summary laid out step by step how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power, much as the committee did during its televised hearings in the summer. First, the summary said, Mr. Trump lied about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false. He then organized false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden as he pressured state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election. Finally, he amassed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“Even key individuals who worked closely with President Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe panel also referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee — including the man seeking to become the next speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California — because of their refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other Republicans referred were Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Jordan, Russell Dye, said in a statement that the referral was “just another partisan and political stunt.” A spokesman for Mr. Perry, Jay Ostrich, said the committee was engaged in “more games from a petulant and soon-to-be kangaroo court.’’\n\nMr. Biggs said in a tweet that the referral was the committee’s “final political stunt” and that he looked forward to “reviewing their documents, publishing their lies and setting the record straight” in the next Congress.\n\nIn its summary, the committee did not entirely resolve disputed accounts of what happened inside the presidential S.U.V. when Mr. Trump was told by his Secret Service agents that they could not take him to the Capitol to join the crowd on Jan. 6. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, testified under oath to the committee in public last summer that Anthony M. Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff, told her that Mr. Trump grew so angry that he lunged at his Secret Service agent and tried to grab the steering wheel. The Secret Service denied that account anonymously.\n\nThe summary said only that the “committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’” that occurred in the S.U.V. “The vast majority of witnesses who have testified to the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as ‘irate,’ ‘furious,’ ‘insistent,’ ‘profane’ and ‘heated.’”\n\nThe committee’s summary also concluded that there was no nefarious reason for why the National Guard was delayed for hours in responding to violence of Jan. 6.\n\n“Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard,” the committee wrote. “The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”\n\nIn its summary, the panel asked the Justice Department to investigate whether anyone had interfered with or obstructed the panel’s investigation, including whether any lawyers paid for by groups connected to Mr. Trump “may have advised clients to provide false or misleading testimony to the committee.”\n\nAmong the committee’s findings, revealed at its meeting on Monday, was that lawmakers became concerned that lawyers who were paid by Trump associates may have tried to interfere with the panel’s investigation. The panel also learned that a client was offered potential employment that would make her “financially very comfortable” as the date of her testimony approached. But then offers were withdrawn or did not materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the committee said.\n\nThe committee also chastised certain witnesses that it said had not been forthright with investigators. It said it had “significant concerns about the credibility” of the testimony of Mr. Ornato.\n\nThe committee also said Kayleigh McEnany, one of Mr. Trump’s former press secretaries, and Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, had been less than forthcoming.\n\nThe summary demonstrated, as the committee’s hearings did, how despite being told repeatedly that his claims of election fraud were false, Mr. Trump kept up the lies.\n\nBill Stepien, a former White House political director, told the committee how he and others would investigate the claims, find them to be false, and report back to the president. “It’s an easier job to be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations,” Mr. Stepien said. “It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe summary also contained evidence that certain White House aides had grown concerned about the potential for violence on Jan. 6 and urged Mr. Trump to make a pre-emptive statement calling for peace. No such statement was made.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House communications director, said she suggested “several times” on Jan. 4 and 5 that Mr. Trump “publicly state that Jan. 6 must remain peaceful, and that he had refused her advice to do so,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel played new video from Ms. Hicks, who described a conversation with Mr. Trump.\n\n“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Ms. Hicks said she told the president.\n\nMr. Trump’s response? “Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning,” she recalled him saying.\n\nWhile the executive summary of the report focused heavily on Mr. Trump, it did conclude some findings about law enforcement failures, a topic not previously addressed at the panel’s hearings. “No analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6,” the committee wrote, although the “intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol.”\n\nOver the past year and a half, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than one million documents, issued more than 100 subpoenas and held hearings that drew millions of viewers.\n\nThe House created the Jan. 6 committee after Senate Republicans used a filibuster to defeat a proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the attack.\n\nThe committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — consistently broke new ground for a congressional investigation. Staffed with more than a dozen former federal prosecutors, the panel set a new production standard for how to hold a congressional hearing. It also got significantly ahead of a parallel Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, with federal prosecutors later interviewing many of the same witnesses Congress had spoken to.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal prosecutors under the supervision of a special counsel have issued subpoenas to officials in seven states in which the Trump campaign organized electors to falsely certify the election for Mr. Trump despite the voters choosing Mr. Biden.\n\nLawmakers on the panel also believe they played a significant role in elevating the issue of threats to democracy to voters, who rejected many election deniers in the November midterms.\n\nIn terms of legislative recommendations, the panel has already endorsed overhauling the Electoral Count Act, the law that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to exploit on Jan. 6 in an attempt to cling to power. Lawmakers have also discussed changes to the Insurrection Act and legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. Those recommendations are expected to be detailed in the committee’s final report.\n\nKatie Benner and Anushka Patil contributed reporting.\n\nAnnotation: This reflects the committee’s finding that Mr. Trump’s repeated false claims that the election was rigged had both a political and financial motive. During its second hearing, the panel introduced evidence that Trump supporters donated nearly $100 million to Mr. Trump’s so-called Election Defense Fund but that the money flowed instead into a super PAC the president had created. It was not just “the big lie,” the committee said. It was also “the big rip-off.”\n\n2. Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisers refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.\n\nAnnotation: Mr. Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results of the election and lost all but one of them. Many of the suits, the committee determined, were brought even after some of Mr. Trump’s closest aides — including his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and his attorney general, William P. Barr — told him that there was no fraud that could have changed the outcome of the race.\n\n3. Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no state had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The committee discovered that the lawyer John Eastman had advised Mr. Trump to undertake a campaign to push Mr. Pence into single-handedly deciding the election in his favor even though there was evidence that Mr. Eastman knew the plan was illegal. Some of Mr. Pence’s own aides told Mr. Trump the same, but he pressured Mr. Pence nonetheless.\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of acting attorney general to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.\n\nAnnotation: After leaders in the Justice Department — including Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his deputy — told Mr. Trump that he was wrong about his claims concerning fraud in the election, Mr. Trump wanted to appoint Mr. Clark, a loyalist, to run the department. Mr. Clark had promised to send out letters to leaders in key swing states saying that prosecutors had in fact found fraud in the election. The president decided not to appoint Mr. Clark only after several senior department officials threatened to quit if he did.\n\n5. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states.\n\nAnnotation: In the weeks that followed the election, Mr. Trump and his allies had calls and meetings with local officials in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona in which they pressured the officials to use their powers to assign electors from the states to him. More famously, Mr. Trump also asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to help him “find” the 11,000 votes he needed to win the election there.\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAnnotation: This refers to one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive schemes to maintain his grip on power: a plan to have state officials create and submit fake electors pledged to him in seven swing states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states.\n\nAnnotation: The committee found that Mr. Trump also played a role in a plan closely related to the fake-electors scheme: He helped to persuade 139 House Republicans to dispute the Electoral College count on the day the Capitol was attacked.\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in federal court.\n\nAnnotation: In December 2020, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in Fulton County, Ga., contending that thousands of votes had been improperly counted and citing specific numbers of dead people, felons and unregistered voters who had cast ballots. Mr. Trump signed an official attestation attached to the suit swearing that the data in it was accurate despite the fact that one of his own lawyers, Mr. Eastman, had determined it was false.\n\n9. Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for Jan. 6. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to “take back” their country.\n\nAnnotation: The committee determined that a tweet posted by Mr. Trump on Dec. 19, 2020, announcing a “wild” protest in Washington on Jan. 6 was heard as a clarion call by both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters who sprang into action preparing for the event. When they got to Washington for the rally, Mr. Trump’s speech calling on them to “fight like hell” was a central driver in sending them on toward the Capitol.\n\n10. Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation: The tweet the committee is referring to here said, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.” Court papers show that some rioters at the Capitol responded directly to it by pushing toward and ultimately into the building.\n\n11. Knowing that violence was underway at the Capitol, and despite his duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple-hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television. This failure to act perpetuated the violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress’s proceeding to count electoral votes.\n\nAnnotation: The committee accused Mr. Trump of “a dereliction of duty” for letting nearly three hours pass between learning that the Capitol was under siege and calling for his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds. During that time, several people close to him — including his daughter Ivanka — begged Mr. Trump to issue a statement that would calm down the crowd.\n\n12. Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n13. The intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did successfully detect the planning for potential violence on Jan. 6, including planning specifically by the Proud Boys and Oath Keeper militia groups who ultimately led the attack on the Capitol. As Jan. 6 approached, the intelligence specifically identified the potential for violence at the Capitol. This intelligence was shared within the executive branch, including with the Secret Service and the president’s National Security Council.\n\n14. Intelligence gathered in advance of Jan. 6 did not support a conclusion that antifa or other left-wing groups would likely engage in a violent counterdemonstration, or attack Trump supporters on Jan. 6. Indeed, intelligence from Jan. 5 indicated that some left-wing groups were instructing their members to “stay at home” and not attend on Jan. 6. Ultimately, none of these groups was involved to any material extent with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n15. Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence in advance of Jan. 6 on the full extent of the ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot by sending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale of the violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcement anticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave the Capitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysis predicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognized the full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAnnotation for 13, 14 and 15: The committee has faced criticism, especially from Republicans, for not focusing more attention on the failures by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack. But the panel did present some preliminary findings and may ultimately issue a separate report.\n\n16. Hundreds of Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers performed their duties bravely on Jan. 6, and America owes those individual immense gratitude for their courage in the defense of Congress and our constitution. Without their bravery, Jan. 6 would have been far worse. Although certain members of the Capitol Police leadership regarded their approach to Jan. 6 as “all hands on deck” the Capitol Police leadership did not have sufficient assets in place to address the violent and lawless crowd. Capitol Police leadership did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensue after President Trump instructed tens of thousands of his supporters in the Ellipse crowd to march to the Capitol, and then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Although Chief Steven Sund raised the idea of National Guard support, the Capitol Police Board did not request Guard assistance prior to Jan. 6. The Metropolitan Police took an even more proactive approach to Jan. 6, and deployed roughly 800 officers, including responding to the emergency calls for help at the Capitol. Rioters still managed to break their line in certain locations, when the crowd surged forward in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet. The Department of Justice readied a group of federal agents at Quantico and in the District of Columbia, anticipating that Jan. 6 could become violent, and then deployed those agents once it became clear that police at the Capitol were overwhelmed. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security were also deployed to assist.\n\n17. President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6 or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the secretary of defense could, and ultimately did, deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The select committee recognizes that some at the department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nAnnotation: The question of why it took so long to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol is one of the enduring mysteries of Jan. 6. While the committee sharply criticized Mr. Trump for failing to taking action that day, it also found that there was no evidence the deployment of the Guard was delayed for political reasons.\n\nThe panel voted 9 to 0 to accept the final report and to urge the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against Mr. Trump and his allies in four separate areas of the law.\n\nHere are some takeaways:\n\nThe committee kept its focus on Trump.\n\nThe committee’s hourlong presentation focused almost exclusively on Mr. Trump, essentially ignoring findings about intelligence and security failures at the Capitol before and during the attack. The committee also did not dwell on the information it collected about the rise of domestic extremism.\n\nThe focus on Mr. Trump had been telegraphed for months as the committee drafted its final report, using it primarily as a means to hold Mr. Trump to account for his actions in trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power after a presidential election. As Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican and the panel’s vice chairwoman, put it: “Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one.”\n\nIn one place, the report laid out the facts of how Trump attempted to stay in power.\n\nThe summary of the committee’s final report is a remarkable account of a president’s desperate attempt to stay in office following his election loss to Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\nWhile it breaks no new ground since the panel’s series of public hearings this summer, the report for the first time brings together all the facts in one place.\n\nThe report states that even people around Mr. Trump “ultimately admitted that they lacked actual evidence sufficient to change the election result, and they admitted that what they were attempting was unlawful.”\n\nThe report laid out, step by step, how Mr. Trump sought to cling to power after losing the 2020 election: first, by lying about widespread fraud, despite being told his claims were false; by organizing false slates of electors in states won by Mr. Biden; by pressuring state officials, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election; and finally, by amassing a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they engaged in hours of bloody violence while Mr. Trump did nothing to call them off.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusion: The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the report states. “None of the events of Jan. 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nThe committee revealed new details from two top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe committee revealed on Monday the investigative work it had done since the end of their previous hearings. That included the panel’s first interviews with two of the former president’s top advisers: Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMs. Hicks, who served as a senior adviser in the White House, said that when she raised concerns with the former president about the actions on Jan. 6 affecting Mr. Trump’s legacy, he responded that “nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.”\n\nThe committee also revealed testimony from Ms. Conway, who described telling Mr. Trump that Jan. 6 was a “terrible day.” She recalled him responding: “No. People are upset. They are very upset.”\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 hurt Trump but did not knock him out of 2024 contention.\n\nThe work of the committee over the past year has already helped to chip away at Mr. Trump’s political standing and his reputation as the nation’s 45th president. Ms. Cheney said again on Monday that Mr. Trump should never “serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump already has announced his pursuit of the presidency again, hoping to reclaim the office he falsely asserts was stolen from him. Despite a rocky campaign announcement and a swirl of potential criminal prosecutions, Mr. Trump remains a central figure in the Republican Party, with strong support across the country. And he has weathered setbacks, both political and legal, before.\n\nThe committee’s legacy is still an open question.\n\nThe legacy of the Jan. 6 committee is now out of the panel’s hands, and will most likely be determined by federal prosecutors in the coming months. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s actions, to determine whether the information sent over by the committee, along with the Justice Department’s own material, warrants charging the former president with any crimes.\n\nThat remains an open question. Members of the committee were firm on Monday in their belief that Mr. Trump and the people around him violated four statutes in the planning and execution of the Capitol attack. They are: obstructing or influencing an official proceeding; conspiring against the U.S. government; making false statements to the government; and engaging in insurrection against the government.\n\nPursuing those charges, or others, against Mr. Trump would be a historic effort to hold the nation’s top official accountable for his actions. But it will be up to the special counsel, and ultimately Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, to decide whether to move forward. Other Justice Department officials will have to decide whether to charge Mr. Trump’s aides as committee members called for.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are already gearing up to discredit the committee when they take control of the House in January. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become the speaker next year, has vowed to investigate the committee’s work and has demanded that the staff and lawmakers preserve records for that purpose.\n\nThe committee has not been a political boon for many of its members.\n\nThe end of the Jan. 6 committee is also the end of the House careers of four of the nine members of the panel.\n\nTwo of them — Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Mr. Kinzinger faced fierce opposition from within his own party because of his frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and his decision to be part of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nTwo others — Ms. Cheney and Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia — lost their House seats in 2022. Ms. Cheney was defeated in her primary campaign in Wyoming after drawing the ire of party officials and voters for her opposition to Mr. Trump and her determination to hold him accountable for Jan. 6. Ms. Luria was defeated in the general election in Virginia.\n\nAll four have said they have no regrets about serving on the committee. But it is unlikely to serve as a political steppingstone for many of its members.\n\nThe panel’s recommendations that charges should be brought were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.\n\nIn presenting the committee’s findings, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”\n\nMr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer John Eastman, an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, concluded that there was evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.\n\nAs for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, Jack Smith, might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.\n\nStill, there has been some overlap between criminal statutes cited by the department and the charges the committee recommended, according to search warrants and subpoenas that have gradually surfaced during the federal inquiry.\n\nOne charge that both the panel and prosecutors have placed at the center of their work is obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. The Justice Department mentioned that count in a warrant used in June to seize the cellphone of Jeffrey Clark, a former department official whom the committee referred for criminal charges on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have already used the obstruction count in nearly 300 criminal cases to describe how the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 disrupted the certification of the election that was taking place there during a joint session of Congress.\n\nDespite its wide use, the statute was never an easy fit for the violence that erupted at the Capitol.\n\nIt was passed into law as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to curb corporate malfeasance by clamping down on things like shredding documents and tampering with witnesses. And defense lawyers have challenged its use in a federal appeals court in Washington, arguing that prosecutors stretched it beyond its original scope and used it to criminalize behavior that closely resembles protest protected by the First Amendment.\n\nStill, the obstruction count could apply much better to Mr. Trump’s behavior than to that of hundreds of ordinary rioters.\n\nThe law requires proving that any interference with a congressional proceeding be done “corruptly.” The committee said in its recommendations that Mr. Trump had clearly acted with a “‘corrupt’ purpose” because he was warned in advance that several of his schemes to maintain his grip on power were illegal.\n\nThe committee also recommended that Mr. Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, a count that has been used in several Justice Department cases against both far-right extremists and ordinary rioters who appeared to have planned in advance to storm the Capitol.\n\nAgain, this conspiracy charge may in fact better describe the evidence against Mr. Trump, who, according to the committee, defrauded the public by making constant false claims that the election had been rigged against him.\n\nAnother charge the committee recommended against Mr. Trump and others was conspiracy to make false statements. That count, according to the panel, was warranted because Mr. Trump took part in a wide-ranging scheme to send to Congress and the National Archives fake slates of electors declaring that he was the victor in several key states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe most serious charge the panel has recommended against Mr. Trump is also likely to be the hardest to prove: insurrection. While the Justice Department has won a conviction on a related charge, seditious conspiracy, against Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, and is set to try five members of another far-right group, the Proud Boys, for sedition, it has not charged anyone with insurrection in more than 900 criminal cases.\n\nStill, a federal judge in Washington laid the ground for a potential insurrection case against Mr. Trump in a ruling in February that permitted a series of Jan. 6-related civil cases filed against the former president to move forward.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, said Mr. Trump was not merely exercising his First Amendment right to free speech when he called on the crowd listening to him on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nJudge Mehta also found that there was a reasonable case to be made that Mr. Trump had aided and abetted those in the mob who assaulted the police at the Capitol — in part by waiting so long to call publicly for the rioters to calm down. One of the ways prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection is by showing that he gave “aid and comfort” to other insurrectionists who took part in a rebellion against the government.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/jan-6-hearing-livestream-10-13-2022/index.html', 'Headline': 'Live updates: Jan. 6 hearing livestream and analysis - CNN', 'Snippet': 'The House Jan. 6 committee voted Thursday to subpoena former President Donald Trump for documents and testimony at the conclusion of the panel’s final hearing before the midterm elections.', 'Full_text': 'Key takeaways from the Jan. 6 committee\'s 10th public hearing\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection held its 10th public hearing, unveiling new evidence and video that showed how former President Donald Trump knew he had lost the election but still went forward with efforts to overturn the results, leading to the attack at the US Capitol.\n\nDuring the hearing, the panel also voted unanimously to subpoena Trump. It’s rare but not without precedent for Congress to subpoena sitting and former presidents for testimony.\n\nAdditionally, in the roughly three months since the last hearing, the panel has obtained more than 1 million records from the Secret Service. These messages revealed agents spotted numerous guns in the crowd the morning of Jan. 6 before Trump was set to speak at the Ellipse. Agents were also aware of the involvement of right-wing groups.\n\nHere are some other key takeaways:\n\nNever-before-seen video: The committee played previously unseen footage from Fort McNair, the DC-area Army base where congressional leaders took refuge during the insurrection and scrambled to respond to the unfolding crisis. The footage shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top officials working the phones and coordinating with Trump Cabinet members and other officials to secure the resources needed to quell the insurrection and secure the Capitol.\n\nViolent online rhetoric: Days before the attack, Trump’s communication adviser, Jason Miller, boasted to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that he “got the base FIRED UP,” and shared a link to a pro-Trump webpage containing hundreds of threatening comments about killing lawmakers. “Our ‘lawmakers’ in Congress can leave one of two ways: 1. in a body bag 2. After rightfully certifying Trump the winner,” one post on the webpage said. “Gallows don’t require electricity,” another post read. The committee said the Secret Service was also monitoring this kind of online activity.\n\nThreats against Pence: The Secret Service received alerts of online threats made against then-Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be “‘a dead man walking if he doesn’t do the right thing,’” according to committee member Rep. Adam Schiff. On the day of the attack, Pence ultimately rejected pleas from Trump and his top allies to halt certification of Joe Biden’s victory\n\nPremeditated plan to declare victory: Deposition video and a memo obtained from the National Archives showed how former Vice President Mike Pence’s Counsel, Greg Jacob, and Pence’s then-chief of staff Marc Short prepared for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results. “We also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump’s former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,” committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\n\nTrump knew he lost — but tried to change results anyway: Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided new testimony to the committee relaying anecdotes of Trump acknowledging he had lost the election. Hutchinson’s testimony had been some of the most damning against Trump during the summer hearings, as she provided detailed accounts about Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. On Thursday, the committee showed a new video deposition from Hutchinson where she spoke to Meadows about Trump’s January 2021 call where he urged the Georgia secretary of state to “find” the votes he needed to win. Hutchinson also said that she witnessed a conversation between Meadows and Trump where he was furious the Supreme Court had rejected a lawsuit seeking to overturn the election result.\n\nGinni Thomas\' testimony noticeably absent from Jan. 6 committee hearing\n\nOne person whose testimony was noticeably absent from the House select committee’s hearing on Thursday was Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nCommittee members interviewed Thomas last month but ultimately her testimony was not featured as part of the last hearing before the midterm election.\n\nDespite saying for months that they wanted to hear from Thomas, members downplayed the significance of her testimony following her interview, and it was clear ahead of Thursday that she was not expected to be a central part of the hearing that was instead solely focused on former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut her absence was notable considering the panel did use testimony from several other high-profile witnesses who had been interviewed since the committee’s most recent hearing earlier this summer.\n\nSome context: Members of the panel have long said they are interested in speaking with Thomas, particularly after CNN first reported text messages she exchanged with then-Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The texts show Thomas urging Meadows to continue the fight to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe committee also has email correspondence between Thomas and Trump’s election attorney John Eastman.\n\nJan. 6 committee isn\'t planning to subpoena Pence, chair says\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the Jan. 6 committee, told CNN that the panel is not planning to subpoena former Vice President Mike Pence, after they voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Democrat from Mississippi answered “no” when asked by CNN’s Manu Raju whether it was in the committee’s plans.\n\nThompson also told CNN that the committee’s previous interest in hearing from Pence has waned, saying “we have collected enough evidence” that Pence “did his job.”\n\n“We now need to hear from the President,” he added.\n\nRep. Raskin says committee chose to subpoena Trump because witnesses close to him pled the Fifth\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the Jan. 6 committee, told CNN the reason the panel felt it needed to subpoena former President Donald Trump is because it has been unable to nail down his specific actions and conversations.\n\nRaskin added that witnesses closest to Trump, who could provided specifics, have pled the Fifth when interviewed by the committee.\n\nRaskin pushed back on the notion that this subpoena would merely be a symbolic act that gets tied up in court.\n\n“I want to believe that every American citizen who knows something about these events would come forward to testify and nobody knows more about them than Donald Trump,” he said.\n\nBut when pressed again on how the committee will handle Trump’s efforts to likely block this subpoena, Raskin said, “we haven’t discussed that because you’re several hypothetical steps down the road from us. But I’ll say this, we certainly have litigated in the past, and I think we’ve got a pretty unbroken track record of winning our cases precisely because all we’re asking people to do is to come forward and testify. And the Supreme Court has been perfectly clear that Congress has the power to do that.”\n\nJUST IN: Jan. 6 committee votes to subpoena Trump\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee voted Thursday to subpoena former President Donald Trump for documents and testimony at the conclusion of the panel’s final hearing before the midterm elections.\n\nThe unanimous vote marks an escalation in the committee’s efforts to obtain testimony from the former President, though at this late stage, it’s unlikely that Trump would comply with the subpoena – and the committee likely doesn’t have time for a lengthy court fight.\n\nIt’s rare but not without precedent for Congress to subpoena sitting and former presidents for testimony.\n\nHouse Select Committee Char Bennie Thompson and Vice Chair Liz Cheney argued the committee needed to hear from Trump to tell the most complete story it can about the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nCheney said more than 30 witnesses have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, including some who communicated with Trump. She noted that others, like Steve Bannon, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify – and Bannon was convicted after the Justice Department indicted him – but argued the committee couldn’t wait for the Justice Department to obtain information from those recalcitrant witnesses.\n\n“At some point, the Department of Justice may well unearth the facts that these and other witnesses are currently concealing,” Cheney said. “But our duty today is to our country and our children and our Constitution. We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion. And every American is entitled to the answers, so we can act now to protect our republic,” she said.\n\nNational Security official corroborates account of Trump’s angry outburst on Jan. 6\n\nA national security official who worked in the White House told the House select committee that former President Donald Trump’s angry outburst in the presidential SUV on Jan. 6, 2021 was so widely known that it became “water cooler talk,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, said Thursday.\n\nThe account of the official, whose identity was not revealed by the Jan. 6 committee, further corroborates earlier testimony from former Mark Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson about Trump angrily reacting to being told by his Secret Service agents he could not go to the US Capitol after his speech on Jan. 6.\n\nMore on the incident: Hutchinson testified in a June hearing that Tony Ornato told her Trump became “irate” when informed by security that he would not be going to the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, because the situation was not secure.\n\nOrnato said that Trump was so enraged at his Secret Service detail for blocking him from going to the Capitol that “he reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel” and “then used his free hand to lunge towards” Secret Service agent Robert Engel.\n\nHutchinson testified that Ornato told her the story in front of Engel and he did not dispute the account.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have contested Hutchinson’s account as they’ve sought to undermine her testimony against Trump.\n\nSecret Service received alerts of threats against Pence if he didn\'t ""do the right thing"" on day of riot\n\nCommittee member Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said in Thursday’s hearing that the US Secret Service had received alerts of online threats made against then-Vice President Mike Pence ahead of the Capitol insurrection, including that Pence would be “‘a dead man walking if he doesn’t do the right thing.’”\n\nHe continued: “Another agent reported, ‘I saw several other alerts saying they will storm the Capitol if he doesn’t do the right thing.’”\n\nOn the day of the attack, Pence ultimately rejected pleas from Trump and his top allies to halt certification of Joe Biden’s victory by the House and Senate, hours after he was forced to take shelter at a secure location inside the US Capitol while a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building — with some chanting “Hang Mike Pence” as they breached security barriers.\n\nFormer deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere told the committee in a video deposition that on the day of the attack, Trump talked at length about how “fired up” the crowd outside the White House waiting for his rally was.\n\nAsked by investigators what he said about it, Deere replied: “Just that they were — they were fired up. They were angry. They feel like the election’s been stolen, that the election was rigged, that — he went on and on about that for a little bit.”\n\nPanel presents new evidence showing Trump planned to declare victory no matter what the election results were\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new evidence Thursday that former President Donald Trump had a premeditated plan — devised before any votes had been counted — to declare victory no matter what the election results were.\n\n“We also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump’s former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election, even if he lost,” Lofgren added.\n\nThe evidence presented Thursday includes video from the committee’s deposition of former Vice President Mike Pence’s Counsel, Greg Jacob, during which Jacob describes how he and Pence’s then-chief of staff Marc Short prepared for Trump to declare victory on Election Night, regardless of the results.\n\n“Marc had indicated to me that there was a possibility that there would be a declaration of victory within the White House that some might push for – and this is prior to the election results being known – and he was trying to figure out a way of avoiding the Vice President sort of being thrust into a position of needing to opine on that when he might not have sufficient information to do so,” Jacob says in the video clip.\n\nAfter this conversation on Nov. 3, 2020, Jacob drafted a memo to Short, which the committee said it obtained from the National Archives and presented for the first time on Thursday.\n\n“ … it is essential that the Vice President not be perceived by the public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,” the memo reads.\n\nMore of the committee’s revelations: The committee also revealed an email conservative legal activist Tom Fitton sent to two Trump advisers a few days before the election that contains a draft statement for Trump to declare victory on election night.\n\nThe draft prepared statement, sent to Trump aides Molly Michael and Dan Scavino on Oct. 31, 2020, declares: “We had an election today, and I won.”\n\nIt also emphasizes that only the votes “counted by the Election Day deadline” would matter, even though the former President was aware that vote counting would lawfully continue past election day. Another email from Fitton to Michael and Scavino that day notes that he “just talked to him about the draft below,” an apparent reference to Trump himself.\n\nTrump was warned by advisers on Election Night that it was “far too early to make any proclamation” of victory, according to video of the former President’s then-campaign manager Bill Stepien that was presented by the committee, but went ahead and declared victory anyway.\n\nCommittee’s evidence has come ""almost entirely"" from Republicans close to Trump, chair says\n\nThe chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said evidence the panel has displayed throughout their 10 public hearings has mostly came from Republican witnesses.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said the “facts and testimony are clear” and well-documented. He said that the most “striking fact” of the committee’s work is that these facts came “almost entirely from” Republicans and people who worked closely with former President Donald Trump.\n\nThompson cited White House aides and campaign officials who worked for Trump, Republican state officials, Republican electors, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Trump political appointees in the Justice Department and even members of Trump’s family.\n\nThe committee has used video-taped depositions from those around Trump – testimony often obtained via subpoena – throughout the panel’s hearings over the summer to illustrate how Trump was told he lost the election and warned that his efforts to overturn it could result in violence.\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe committee\'s overarching goal today: refocus on Donald Trump himself\n\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is going into Thursday’s hearing with the intention of refocusing on Donald Trump himself — his “action and inaction” and his “central culpability” in the riot, according to two sources familiar with the panel’s plans.\n\nNew material from the Secret Service will help show Trump’s role leading up to and on the day of Jan. 6, the sources say.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the committee has been weighed whether to use this hearing to name specific election deniers in the Republican Party to showcase their argument that Trump’s election lies are a major threat to democracy. But they want to instead keep the focus squarely on Trump, according to a source familiar with the internal discussion\n\nWhen Americans could see a report: Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson has told reporters in the past that the committee will release an interim report before midterms. But another source involved in writing the report said that putting together an interim report before the midterms seems increasingly unlikely given the limited time they have. The concern that doing so would take away from the larger report they plan to release by year’s end.\n\nNew documentary film footage shows Roger Stone discussing violence pre-Election Day\n\nThe day before the 2020 election, Roger Stone, the long-time Republican operative and ally of former President Donald Trump, said in front of a documentary film crew that he had no interest in waiting to tally actual votes before contesting the election results.\n\nThe clip is one of multiple pieces of footage obtained by CNN that the filmmakers also shared with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The video shows Stone as an early proponent of contesting the election – even before the results were in – and raising the possibility of violence months before January 6.\n\nThe filmmakers tell CNN they came to an agreement to share certain clips with the committee after a subpoena for the footage was signed by the panel’s chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and delivered to the filmmakers in Copenhagen about two months ago.\n\nThe filmmakers, Christoffer Guldbrandsen and Frederik Marbell, followed Stone for portions of about three years for their documentary film.\n\nThe footage shared with the committee may be incorporated into its upcoming hearing this week. Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, suggested publicly over the weekend that the panel has more to reveal about the connection between Stone and domestic extremist groups, as well as efforts to keep Trump in power after the US Capitol attack and the ongoing threats to democracy.\n\n“Stay tuned,” Raskin said at the Texas Tribune festival last month when asked about Stone’s possible connections to the Capitol riot.\n\n“He’s someone who I think saw where things were going,” Raskin said.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN’s Don Lemon, the filmmakers said the committee appeared interested in footage that focused on Stone’s relationship with the White House, and also his alleged ties to the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. The filmmakers said they were not able to establish a link between Stone, those groups and the White House.\n\nRead more about the documentary here.\n\nSecret Service recently provided Jan. 6 committee with additional 1.5 million communications\n\nThe United States Secret Service has, in the last two weeks, given the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol nearly 1.5 million communications from the lead-up to the attack, including emails and planning documents, according to an agency spokesman.\n\nThe data dump represents another large volume of records provided to congressional investigators as the panel prepared to hold its final planned public hearing before the midterms.\n\nCNN previously reported the Secret Service gave hundreds of thousands of records to both the Department of Homeland Security inspector general and the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nThe latest batch of records, which was first reported by NBC News, does not include the text messages lost to a data migration that prompted a criminal probe by the inspector general.\n\nThe DHS appointed a special counsel to review materials from the Secret Service to ensure the agency could satisfy the January 6 committee’s probe without running afoul of the IG’s criminal inquiry, which demanded the Secret Service halt its investigation into missing texts.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the committee has received around 800,000 pages of materials from the Secret Service in response to a subpoena since July, as the committee continues to investigate why certain text messages from Secret Service agents went missing from Jan. 5 and 6, 2021.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, has described the trove of documents the Secret Service provided as “significant information.”\n\nAs the Jan. 6 committee enters its final stage, these key questions remain unanswered\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has been able to uncover much of the multi-faceted plot to subvert the 2020 presidential election. But as it heads into its final hearing before the midterms, there are a few investigative threads that remain unanswered.\n\nThe committee has presented evidence that former President Donald Trump wanted to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6, eliciting testimony from numerous witnesses describing the former President’s urgent desire to be driven to the Capitol complex by his Secret Service detail following his speech on the Ellipse. It also has established that Trump anticipated staying in office.\n\nYet the committee has not been able to uncover precisely what Trump planned to do upon arriving at the Capitol, a source familiar with its investigation says, and attributes the gap in knowledge to the limited subpoena power of the committee. It also has been unable to definitively conclude if Trump had a plan. Instead, the committee has developed a number of working theories, the source says.\n\nUnderstanding Trump’s intentions for going to the Capitol on Jan. 6 would provide insight into his state of mind that day and could expose more potentially criminal activity, as the committee has sought to do throughout its investigation and hearings.\n\nAmong the biggest questions hanging over the committee ahead of its hearing Thursday is whether it will make a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Multiple members on the committee have told CNN the panel has still not reached a decision.\n\nSpeaking at the Texas Tribune festival last month, committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, said “I think we will be unanimous” when asked how the panel will approach the process of whether to make a criminal referral.\n\nThere is also a growing sense among committee members that the Justice Department will be able to fill in some of the unanswered questions left by the committee’s investigation because of the subpoena power that comes with its ongoing criminal investigation, particularly when it comes to senior officials from Trump’s orbit like his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and longtime confidante Roger Stone, who cited various claims of privilege to limit cooperation with the congressional panel.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jan-6-hearings-committee-criminal-referrals-trump-final-report', 'Headline': 'LIVE: Jan. 6 panel announces 4 criminal referrals for Donald Trump', 'Snippet': 'The House Select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued its final report. It includes several four referrals for Donald Trump. Follow our live updates.', 'Full_text': 'Progressives have been irritated with Attorney General Merrick Garland’s methodical (read: slow) pace of pursuing charges against Trump. But it’s going to be up to the special counsel whether it brings charges or what they are.\n\nThey do not have to act on what the Jan. 6 committee recommends, though investigators are paying close attention to the details of its findings.\n\nBut don’t expect to hear much about the special counsel’s progress, as the DOJ tends to stay pretty quiet, if not wholly silent, on the details of ongoing investigations until they present them in court.\n\nPolitically, it’s going to be up to voters to choose. Trump will likely retain support with his base. As we noted, Republicans have been the least likely to be paying close attention to these hearings. In a multi-candidate primary, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut he’s in legal trouble in multiple states, not just federally, and many of his preferred candidates – and election deniers – lost in swing states. So whether it’s because of the chaos that often surrounds him, the threat he presents to U.S. democracy and faith in its elections, or simply because his brand is not a winner in competitive states where Republicans likely need to win to take over the White House and Congress, Trump is at his most vulnerable point since winning the presidency six years ago.\n\nAnd the members of this committee – some of whom won’t be returning to Congress because of the wrath, or potential wrath, of Trump’s base – certainly hope voters respond.\n\n“The future of our democracy rests in your hands,” chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said today. “It’s up to the people to decide who is deserving of the public trust.”\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt’s no secret that the country is divided politically and partisanship, particularly among Republicans, has become entrenched. So despite the primary evidence – with testimony from Republicans who were aligned with Trump – people have been watching selectively.\n\nThe committee in its report recognized this:\n\n“Although the Committee’s hearings were viewed live by tens of millions of Americans and widely publicized in nearly every major news source, the Committee also recognizes that other news outlets and commentators have actively discouraged viewers from watching, and that millions of other Americans have not yet seen the actual evidence addressed by this Report.”\n\nSo the committee said it’s releasing video summaries with each relevant piece of evidence. And it’s likely why the beginning of the hearing included so many clips of previously seen testimony from past hearings, almost like the recap of a prior season of a series on Netflix.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest those who watched were moved. Before the hearings, just 48% of independents in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they thought Trump was to blame a “great deal” or “good amount” for what happened that day. After several hearings, the July survey found that the percentage blaming Trump spiked to 57%.\n\nRepublicans were only up marginally – and still fewer than 1-in-5 said Trump was responsible for what happened.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats and 55% of independents said they were paying “a lot” or “some” attention to the hearings. But 56% of Republicans said they were not.\n\nIt’s not hard to draw a straight line between the numbers of those paying attention and the movement – or lack thereof – in the survey.\n\n➡️A full set of takeaways from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro, will be available on NPR.org tomorrow morning.\n\nIt\'s now been more than an hour after the Jan. 6 committee hearing wrapped, and former President Donald Trump has made only one comment related to today\'s hearing: A knock on Vice Chair Liz Cheney\'s primary loss in August.\n\n""...But Liz Chaney lost by a record 40 points!"" he wrote, misspelling Cheney\'s name in a post on Truth Social, the social media network he founded in the wake of his bans from mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook after the riot at the Capitol.\n\nCheney, a Republican who is Wyoming\'s sole representative in the House, lost in the August primary to her Trump-endorsed challenger by 37.4 percentage points. As a result, she will not return to Congress next year.\n\nOn a day when the House committee referred him for criminal prosecution on four different charges, Trump instead focused most of his public statements on two other subjects: the possibility of a Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 coming to an end, and conservative media reports about content moderation decisions at Twitter during the 2020 election campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump complained that the committee was ""highly partisan"" and accused its members of ""illegally leaking"" confidential information.\n\n""How much longer are Republicans, and American Patriots in general, going to allow this to happen,"" he wrote.\n\nAnd he applauded the reinstatement of his Twitter account and his two public posts on Jan. 6 asking rioters to ""remain peaceful."" Those tweets were sent long after he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol; by the time he made his first post, rioters had already been inside the Capitol for nearly 30 minutes, and at least one rioter was already dead, according to the timeline established by the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation was hampered by lack of cooperation by witnesses, ultimately impacting the number of referrals the committee could send to the Justice Department, committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Monday.\n\n""There were undoubtedly other people involved. But we were stymied by virtue of a lot of people refusing to come and testify, refusing to give us information they had, or taking the 5th Amendment,"" Raskin said, speaking to reporters immediately after the committee\'s meeting ended. ""We chose to advance the names of people where we felt certain that there was abundant evidence that they had participated in crimes, and so we\'re sending those over. It\'s not to the exclusion of anyone else.""\n\nThe evidence gathered by the committee will be shared in full with the Department of Justice this week, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Much will be released to the public on Wednesday, including interview transcripts.\n\nThe DOJ has carried on its own investigation of the events leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Some witnesses who refused to cooperate with the House committee may be compelled to cooperate with the Department of Justice, which has greater capabilities to enforce subpoenas.\n\n""The long and the short of it is we possess evidence that, up until this release, the Justice Department may not have. They possess evidence that we don\'t have. And the cumulative impact of all of that evidence will hopefully lead to justice for those who have broken the law here,"" said Rep. Schiff.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee has officially outlined criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump and other individuals on four charges.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., discussed the charges at the end of the committee\'s meeting on Monday, as well as the standard that it used to decide them.\n\n""We propose advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, severity of its actual harm and centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election compel us to speak,"" he said.\n\nThese are the charges the committee is making:\n\nObstruction of an official proceeding of the U.S. government: Raskin said the evidence described by his colleagues in hearings warrants a criminal referral of Trump, John Eastman and others for violation of Title 18, Section 1512C, adding that ""the whole purpose and obvious effect of Trump\'s scheme were to obstruct, influence and impede this official proceeding.""\n\nConspiracy to defraud the U.S.: Raskin said there is ""more than sufficient evidence"" to refer Trump, Eastman and others for violating Title 18, Section 371, which covers making an agreement to impair, obstruct or defeat the lawful functions of the U.S. government by deceitful or dishonest means.\n\nHe added that Trump didn\'t engage in these actions alone, and that the committee\'s full report details the efforts of co-conspirators who agreed with and participated in Trump\'s plan to defeat certification of Biden\'s victory. But he also stressed that the panel doesn\'t attempt to determine all potential participations, since many individuals have refused to answer its questions. It trusts the Justice Department will be able to form a more complete picture through its investigation, Raskin added.\n\nConspiracy to make a false statement: The committee alleges that Trump and others knowingly and willfully made materially false statements to the federal government in violation of U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001. Raskin said the evidence ""clearly suggests"" Trump conspired with others to submit slates of false electors to Congress and the National Archives. Like with the previous charge, Raskin said many individuals refused to answer questions under oath and that the Justice Department may be able to shed more light on this alleged conspiracy.\n\n""Incite,” “assist” or “aid and comfort” an insurrection: An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the U.S., Raskin said, a ""grave federal offense"" that is written into the constitution as grounds for automatically disqualifying participants from holding office at the state or federal level. Raskin said ""more than sufficient evidence exists"" for a criminal referral of Trump for assisting, aiding and comforting those at the Capitol.\n\nStressing the lack of cooperation by potentially key individuals, Raskin also said the committee is referring four members of Congress for sanction by the House ethics committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas. And he said all of these referrals are not a decision the committee took likely.\n\n""We understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,"" he said. ""But we have gone where the facts and the law lead us and, inescapably, they lead us here.""\n\nRaskin said that the events of Jan. 6 consist of ""hundreds of individual criminal offenses,"" most of which are already being prosecuted by the Justice Department. But he emphasized that ""ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.""\n\nThe committee has issued approximately 100 subpoenas to individuals, organizations and corporate entities since it began its investigation.\n\nThe extensive list includes Republican lawmakers, Trump allies, even the ex-president himself. And though many of those who were subpoenaed cooperated with the committee, others did not.\n\nThe full list of subpoenas issued can be found here, but here are some of the notable names:\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nBreitbart News founder Steve Bannon, who also served as Trump’s chief political strategist, said “all hell is going to break loose” on his far-right podcast on the day before the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nHe was subpoenaed by the committee in September 2021, and after Bannon openly mocked the panel and its demands, he was indicted for refusing to provide documents and failing to appear before the committee.\n\nA judge sentenced Bannon to four months in jail and fined him $6,500 this past October, a lesser sentence than the six months and $200,000 federal prosecutors sought.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service\n\nThe committee subpoenaed one of the nation’s elite law enforcement agencies for deleted text messages from the days leading up to and after the Jan. 6 attack along with other electronic documents.\n\nThe Secret Service complied with the request and handed over more than 1 million emails, recordings and other electronic records to the committee.\n\nThe materials obtained through that subpoena showed that the Secret Service knew there was a threat of violence leading up to Jan. 6, and that agents feared for the vice president’s life.\n\nTrump and members of his family\n\nDonald Trump was subpoenaed at the end of the committee’s final hearing in October. And though many of his family members cooperated with the panel voluntarily, others did not, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, one of the former president’s advisors and fiancé of Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe committee also subpoenaed the phone records of the ex-president’s other son, Eric Trump, who — along with Guilfoyle — spoke from the Ellipse on Jan. 6 before the former president told the mob to march on the Capitol.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nThe former law professor joined Trump’s legal team in August 2020 but is best known for his plan for Trump to use then-Vice President Pence to overturn the election results, despite his understanding that doing so would be illegal. Eastman sought a presidential pardon from Trump but didn’t get one.\n\nEastman complied with the subpoena but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at least 100 times.\n\n➡️Check out NPR\'s full subpoena tracker here.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals to the Justice Department, there could be other categories of referrals as well — to the Federal Election Commission, the House Ethics Committee, and bar associations to discipline attorneys. The Justice Department is separately investigating the Jan. 6 attack with a special counsel.\n\nNPR obtained a small portion of a draft script for the Monday meeting that shows the panel intends to accuse lawyers John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro of being tied to the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEastman was a Trump ally who helped lead the effort to overturn President Biden\'s win, while Chesebro has been considered a central figure in the scheme pushing for a slate of fake Trump electors in various states won by Biden.\n\nChesebro\'s attorney, Adam Kaufmann, in an emailed statement to NPR, pushed back of that assertion and said his client gave the Trump campaign pro bono guidance on ""arcane provisions"" of the Electoral Count Act and the 12th Amendment, which outlines procedural steps for electing the president and vice president.\n\nThe panel could also refer five House Republicans who were subpoenaed but refused to cooperate to the House Ethics committee: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut with the congressional session wrapping up in a matter of weeks and Republicans about to take control of the House, it\'s unlikely the ethics panel will launch any new probe.\n\nWhen asked at a press conference last week if he was concerned that he and his colleagues might face criminal referrals, McCarthy said, ""No, not at all. We did nothing wrong.""\n\n🎧Listen to NPR\'s Claudia Grisales discuss her reporting on Morning Edition.\n\nWhat\'s happening today?\n\nThe nine-member committee, which includes seven Democrats and two Republicans, is expected to discuss its final report during Monday\'s meeting. The lawmakers will vote on criminal referrals of key players who plotted to keep Trump in office. The panel is expected to consider criminal referrals for fewer than a dozen individuals. Each member will offer presentations highlighting the specific areas the panel worked on over the course of the investigation.\n\nWhen?\n\n1 p.m. ET\n\nWhy does today\'s meeting matter?\n\nThis is the culmination of a lengthy investigation into the attack on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee is also expected to provide its assessment of weaknesses in the electoral system, which members argued enabled Trump and his allies to go as far as they did in their attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The panel will make policy recommendations aimed at better protecting democratic institutions and processes, including reforming the Electoral Count Act.\n\nWhat\'s next after today?\n\nThe select committee will dissolve at the end of the current Congress, just after the start of the new year. Four members of the panel will not return to the House in 2023: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only two Republican members of the committee, along with Democratic Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia and Stephanie Murphy of Florida.\n\nA lot has happened since the committee held its first hearing in July 2021. NPR has rounded up some of the critical takeaways from the investigation to help bring you up to speed.\n\nLaw enforcement described the attack as “brutal” in the committee’s first hearing\n\nFour police officers testified before the committee at its first hearing on July 27, 2021. One officer described his engagement with the thousands of protesters at the Capitol as ""nothing short of brutal"" and condemned politicians who tried to downplay the attack.\n\nThe officers called on the committee to find out who was responsible for the attack, noting that all signs pointed to former President Trump. One officer even used a hit man analogy to drive the point home to lawmakers.\n\n""If a hit man is hired and he kills somebody, the hit man goes to jail. But not only does the hit man go to jail, but the person who hired him does,"" said Pfc. Harry Dunn of the U.S. Capitol Police, adding, ""I want you to get to the bottom of that.""\n\nTrump tried to pressure Mike Pence into overturning results\n\nTestimony from two advisors to the former vice president painted a picture of Trump trying to strong arm Pence into illegally overturning the 2020 election results, knowing full well that he lost to Joe Biden.\n\nTrump called Pence a “wimp”, among other insults, fueling the crowds who began to call for Pence’s head, and continued to ridicule Pence long after the attack. The public hearing also laid out potential criminal liability for Trump and lawyer John Eastman for conspiring to obstruct Congress.\n\nA tidal wave of Trump allies sought pardons after Jan. 6\n\n""Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,"" former President Trump said, according to the testimony of former acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue.\n\nWhite House staff and lawyers testified before the committee on June 23, 2022, that at least five members of Congress all sought pardons following the attack on the Capitol: Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Mo Brooks, R-Ala.; Louie Gohmert, R-Texas; Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Scott Perry, R-Penn. So did former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and lawyer John Eastman.\n\nThough they all denied any wrongdoing, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said, ""The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is if you committed a crime.""\n\nA former White House aide said Trump knew protesters were armed and didn’t care\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, previously an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, said in a pre-recorded testimony (played during the Jun. 28 hearing) that Trump knew some protesters were armed when he ordered them to march to the Capitol.\n\nShe went on to say that the former president became “irate” when he was told he had to return to the White House instead of joining his supporters at the Capitol. ""\'I am the effing president, take me up to the Capitol now,\'"" Hutchinson recalled the then-president saying.\n\nTrump sued the committee after it subpoenaed him in October\n\nAt the end of the committee’s hearing on Oct. 22, members unanimously voted to subpoena the former president.\n\n""In short, you were at the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. President to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power, ultimately culminating in a bloody attack on our own Capitol and on the Congress itself,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the panel\'s chair, and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., its vice chair, said in a letter to Trump.\n\nThe ex-president was supposed to turn over documents and appear before the committee in November, however, Trump decided not to cooperate and instead filed a lawsuit to avoid confronting the panel.\n\n➡️If you\'re looking for more highlights, check out the big, 14-item list from NPR\'s Senior Political Editor, Domenico Montanaro.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out. Here are the key details and ...', 'Snippet': 'Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday.', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}}",94.0,1

The taping is about to begin for the 38th episode of Gaetz’s “Firebrand” podcast, and Greene is the high-wattage guest star.\n\nGreene has come straight from Dulles Airport, so Gaetz takes a minute to catch her up on today’s topics before the recording starts. There is much to discuss: the latest Anthony Fauci-related controversy; Greene’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border; the five hours Greene recently spent testifying before a Georgia administrative judge that she should not be deemed an insurrectionist and tossed off the congressional ballot. “And then, of course, I’m going to go into our favorite subject,” Gaetz tells his colleague. “How the Republican Party is being led, and how it should be led.”\n\n“Oh boy,” Greene chuckles. “I just got here from the airport! And Matt’s like, let’s start ’er off, and let’s torch the news cycle.”\n\nTorching the news cycle is what Gaetz and Greene love to do. They are constantly in the headlines for their attention-getting antics, outrages and feuds. The pair have defended the Jan. 6 rioters, promoted countless conspiracy theories, hobnobbed with white nationalists and picked fights with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Their own Republican colleagues have called them “unserious,” clowns, bigots, and worse. The humorist Dave Barry called them “Trump’s inner circle of trusted wack jobs.”\n\nGaetz and Greene are the ringleaders of the GOP’s most hard-core, pro-Trump congressional faction. The MAGA Squad, as you might call them, is not a formal caucus, but its numbers are growing—despite the impending departure of one prominent member, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina primary after scandals ranging from insider-trading allegations to lewd videos. The group includes freshmen members like Lauren Boebert, who accused a Muslim colleague of being a member of the “Jihad Squad,” as well as longer-serving representatives like Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who pushed Trump’s Department of Justice to throw out electoral votes after the 2020 election, and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who has extensive ties to white nationalists and once posted an animated video showing him murdering Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. There’s Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot, and Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke at the rally. Several members have been subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 Committee, which is also investigating Representative Barry Loudermilk for leading what some have called a “reconnaissance” tour of the closed Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. There have long been rabble-rousing right-wingers in Congress, but this group makes the Freedom Caucus seem tame.\n\nTo Republicans trying to convince voters to hand them power this November by seeming sensible, sober and interested in governing, they’re a constant headache and distraction. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has described Greene’s “loony lies and conspiracy theories” as a “cancer for the Republican Party.” Not that the MAGA Squad care what the GOP Establishment thinks: Back before Twitter permanently banned her for spreading Covid misinformation, Greene shared a tweet calling Kevin McCarthy—the leader of her own party in the House—a “feckless c-nt.”\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans deride the group as gadflies, irrelevant to the serious business of lawmaking. But in fact, the MAGA Squad has been cannily building leverage and clout in the halls of Congress. Now, with the primary season in full swing across the country, they’re looking to pad their numbers, recruiting like-minded firebrands in red districts, endorsing and campaigning for fellow insurgents in intra-party contests, and even, in some cases, campaigning against their own colleagues. (Gaetz boasts that a rally he headlined last year for Harriet Hageman, a primary opponent of Representative Liz Cheney, was at that time “the largest political event in Wyoming history without a rodeo element.”)\n\nMost political observers expect Republicans to win the House in November, putting McCarthy in line to be the next Speaker. But to win that position, McCarthy will need the backing of 218 of his colleagues. There are currently 208 Republicans in the chamber, and election handicappers project the party will win another 15 to 20 seats. Depending on how many they gain, McCarthy is likely to need the support of even some of the party’s most extreme members. “At this point, not knowing the size of the potential majority, leadership is about keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of the frogs are pretty ugly,” says a former GOP leadership aide who estimates there are about a dozen members of the “real cray cray.”\n\nParticularly if the majority is a narrow one, the MAGA Squad will have ample leverage—and McCarthy has been acting like he knows it. For a time, McCarthy made a feeble effort to rein in his party’s nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. Now he seems more eager to curry favor with them. Last year, he condemned Greene for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust; more recently, when Greene was kicked off Twitter, he issued a fiery statement in her defense. When the New York Times released audio recordings of McCarthy privately condemning Trump and expressing alarm at the rhetoric of Gaetz, Greene and Boebert in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the House Republican leader rushed to make amends with his members. (McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.)\n\nThe MAGA Squad has spent the past year building their power, and now they’re preparing to wield it. If McCarthy—or any other Republican—wants to be Speaker, he’s going to have to go through them. And he’s not getting their votes without meeting their demands, which could include things like prosecuting Fauci, ousting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, or even impeaching President Biden. The purpose, they say, isn’t amassing power for themselves. It’s shaping the agenda—and reshaping what the Republican Party stands for.\n\nGreene and Gaetz make small talk as his staffers set up the livestream on Rumble, a conservative-friendly social-media site. “On two Sunday shows, they had a big discussion of how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz confides to Greene, who sits next to him at a long table surrounded by klieg lights. On the wall of the cramped congressional-office-turned-podcast studio, there’s a black-and-white poster for S.J. “Jerry” Gaetz, the congressman’s grandfather, that dubs him “North Dakota’s Most Progressive Mayor.” In a glass display case, there’s a handwritten note from President Trump, scribbled in Sharpie on an article about Gaetz defending himself against a federal sex-trafficking probe involving the transportation of a 17-year-old across state lines. “Matt, This is Great,” Trump wrote. “Keep fighting – You will WIN!”\n\nMore from TIME\n\nGaetz believes his podcast to be Congress’s first-ever live-streamed simulcast, and sees it as an example of the innovative ways he’s working to get his message out. “They had to mention us by name to talk about how irrelevant we are,” Gaetz continues gleefully. “They love talking about the irrelevant people on the Sunday shows.” As Greene cackles at the irony, three-two-one the recording begins, and Gaetz introduces his guest, “the unbeatable, unstoppable Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nGaetz plays the Sunday-show clips. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, GOP political operative Karl Rove had dismissed the idea that McCarthy faced significant internal opposition. “There may be a few dissidents of the sort of Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene wing of the party, which seems to consist of basically two people,” Rove sniffed, mispronouncing the former’s name as “gites” instead of “gates.”\n\nGaetz turns to Greene to get her take on this statement. “I want to tell you about Karl Rove,” she says, her syrupy Southern accent suddenly clipped and serious. “Karl Rove’s wing of the party is the failure part of our party.” It was this wing of the GOP, she says, that “led us into never-ending foreign wars,” needlessly killing American troops and leaving others to struggle with injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. “Their wing of the party has led us to this massive debt the American people are in,” Greene says. “Their wing of the party sent our jobs overseas. Their wing of the party is the complete failure that exists here in this town, Matt, and nobody cares what Karl Rove has to say. Everyone cares about what you have to say. People care about what I have to say. People care about what Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has to say.”\n\nRead More: On the Campaign Trail With Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShe’s not finished. “So Karl Rove can go kiss my ass, because I could care less what he has to say about any of us,” she says, drumming the table in agitation. “He’s dead wrong. He’s disconnected. And shame on Fox News for constantly having him on there.”\n\n“I do not believe that there is a single Republican running in a single primary in America that would rather stand on stage with Karl Rove or Chris Christie than Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz,” Gaetz responds. “There might be more of them inside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. But there’s more of them that are like us that are going to be voting in these primaries that run from now through September.”\n\nOf all the things she’s done in her 18 months in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudest of having thoroughly irritated her colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike. “A lot of people beat me up and say, ‘Oh, she doesn’t even have committees,’” Greene tells me. “There’s so many ways to be effective, even if you’re not on a committee.”\n\nIn February 2021, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments—just two weeks after she received them—after some of her old comments advocating political violence surfaced. In one 2019 Facebook video, Greene accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which she described as “a crime punishable by death.” The House voted to remove Greene from the budget and education committees by a vote of 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining the Democrats in condemnation. But if they thought that would stop her, they were wrong.\n\nMuch of the House’s business is mundane—dozens of uncontroversial bills that can be passed on a voice vote if no member objects. Realizing this, Greene decided she would park herself on the House floor and object to every one, forcing each of the 435 members to show up and take a position, yea or nay.\n\n“I think at first everybody thought, oh, she’s just mad, she’s got nothing else to do, so she’s pitching a fit,” Greene, who rarely speaks to the national mainstream media, tells me during a recent campaign swing through her Georgia district. A voice vote only takes an instant, but a recorded vote is held open for at least 15 minutes. “Everyone had to stop what they’re doing,” she says, with evident satisfaction. “They would have to leave whatever meeting they had, committee hearing they had, lunch meeting they had, fundraising calls they were doing, all because I would ask for a recorded vote. So it was an annoyance, and it slowed everything down.”\n\nGreene would sit there, hour after hour, making her objections. In March 2021, she knocked 13 bills off the schedule in a single week. Some never came back. Others turned out not to have the votes to pass. A first-term backbencher in the House minority was single-handedly derailing multiple bills the Democratic majority wanted to approve.\n\nThe incensed majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, complained to McCarthy, according to Greene. “He demanded to know, is she going to keep doing this?” she says. “And basically [McCarthy] said, ‘We can’t control her—we can’t make her stop. I think she’s going to keep doing it.’ And I did keep doing it. And then all of a sudden it was Republicans who started getting mad.” (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Greene’s account of his conversation with Hoyer. In a press conference last year, he said “every member has a right” to make such procedural motions.)\n\nAccording to Greene, some of her GOP colleagues told her she was forcing them to take positions on tricky issues they’d rather avoid. “And I thought, you know, that even makes me want to come in harder,” she recalls. “Because, to me, why would any member of Congress be afraid for anyone to know how I vote? So I doubled down and kept doing it.”\n\nA number of her right-wing colleagues have now joined Greene in her floor objections. In May, a fellow House Republican complained to CNN that the tactic was “screwing all of us,” while the Democratic Chairman of the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern, compared the gambit to children throwing tantrums. “It’s clear Kevin McCarthy has no control over his members,” McGovern fumed. By Greene’s count, she has personally forced 39 recorded votes, and together with her allies has forced more than 500.\n\nIt’s a sunny day in Northwest Georgia as Greene and I talk in the back of her campaign SUV, which is stocked with energy drinks, Advil and—Greene’s favorite—peanut M&Ms. She’s campaigning in advance of the May 24 primary, which she will soon win easily. Greene may not be popular in Washington, but she’s very popular here. The primary pitted her against five Republican challengers, all of whom campaigned on behaving less divisively. One was backed by the D.C. GOP establishment, with support from numerous national political-action committees and even some of Greene’s congressional colleagues. (Donors included Senators Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney.) Greene went on to take 70% of the primary vote, winning by a 50-point margin.\n\nAt campaign stops, the 48-year-old mother of three and former construction executive is mobbed by fans sporting Let’s Go Brandon T-shirts, InfoWars paraphernalia, and Impeach Biden stickers. At a diner in Rockmart, a small town near the Alabama border, a man with a cane and a big white beard shows up wearing a gray shirt with a picture of Greene shouldering an assault rifle and the words, “The GREENE New Deal.” She laughs and gives him a hug. Constituents tell her they’re worried the next election might be stolen, as they believe the last one was. They ask why the military can’t be deployed to expel “illegal aliens.” They want to know why Democrats don’t seem to believe in God.\n\n“Anything I can do for you?” she asks a man in a booth wearing a Second Amendment trucker cap.\n\n“Just keep doin’ what you’re doin’,” he says. “Give ‘em hell.”\n\nGreene isn’t just a celebrity here. She and Gaetz drew hundreds of supporters on a joint “America First” tour last summer that made stops from Iowa to Arizona. A June Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found three-quarters of American voters have heard of Greene, nearly matching McCarthy’s 87% name recognition. Greene has raised nearly $10 million during her term, making her one of the conference’s top fundraisers. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance cited Greene’s endorsement as one of the most important factors in his recent primary victory, along with Trump’s and Tucker Carlson’s. Liberals and the media may pity or despise the constituents who thrill to Greene’s provocations, but in a democracy, they are as deserving of representation as anyone else, and in Greene, they see the closest thing they’ve had to a real voice in Congress. This is the source of her power, and her colleagues in Washington know it.\n\nBefore she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene was just your average Q-curious Christian mom, posting conspiracy theories on Facebook and cheering Trump against his many haters, from the “Nazi” George Soros to the “Islamic invasion” of Muslim elected officials. Some national Republicans shunned her candidacy—the House GOP’s No. 2, Steve Scalise, backed her primary opponent, though McCarthy was neutral—but Trump embraced her, tweeting that she was “a future Republican Star.”\n\nGreene, who says she still talks to Trump regularly, repaid the favor before she even took office. On Dec. 31, 2020, she texted Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to let him know she had arrived in DC and would “like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again” to “get organized for the 6th,” according to messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee that were obtained by CNN.\n\nOn Jan. 6, she and Gaetz were planning to spearhead an objection to the certification of Michigan’s electoral votes when violence broke out instead. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she texted Meadows. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” The next morning, she wrote, “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Meadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nBy Jan. 17, three days before Biden’s inauguration, she still hadn’t given up. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law,” she told Meadows. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” (Greene has refused to comment on the texts, saying she doesn’t trust CNN and can’t confirm they are authentic.)\n\nToday, her view is that while Jan. 6 was a horrible riot, it’s hypocritical of Democrats to focus on it while ignoring the riots that occurred across the country in the summer of 2020. “I was upset for weeks after [Jan. 6]. I was really shocked,” she tells me. “And then, what happened afterwards, we all get blamed for it. And that is still hurtful to this day—hurtful even more now, because now I’m being thrown in the news as supposedly one of the people that caused it.”\n\nIn our interview, Greene declined to criticize McCarthy for the leaked tapes, ascribing the harsh words to a tense time long past. “I think we were all saying negative things about each other” at that time, she says. “There was a lot of confusion.” She would like to see the caucus run differently in some ways, “but I’m not going to go on a full bashing-Kevin-McCarthy tirade,” she says. “Kind of like I wouldn’t take my kids and fuss at them out in public. I would take them and we would talk about it privately.”\n\nBut Greene is forthright about the fact that she expects to have some leverage over McCarthy if he seeks the Speakership, and she intends to make the most of it. Whoever wants to be the next Speaker, Greene tells me, is going to have to earn her backing—and that of her allies. “I would say my support is very important,” she says. “I think I may have some influence. Probably, if margins are narrow, it would be a strategic key.”\n\nWhat will she demand? Greene doesn’t want to show her hand completely, but says she’s in the process of formulating a policy agenda she calls “American Revival.“ The package of bills, which Greene hopes to unveil before the election, is likely to include her proposals to rein in social media platforms, bolster border security and eliminate Fauci’s position. “I want to see a plan, and I want to know the person is going to stick to it,” she says of whoever solicits her vote for Speaker. She would like to see the GOP majority impeach Biden, for one thing, and pass a federal abortion ban for another. “If everyone says they’re pro-life, we should end abortion,” she tells me. In speeches to constituents, she advocates firing Fauci, investigating Hunter Biden, and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas along with the President. She and Gaetz have argued that a Republican House should focus on investigating and exposing Democratic malfeasance rather than passing partisan “messaging” bills that will never become law.\n\nWhat she definitely doesn’t want to see is a repeat of the Paul Ryan years, which she terms “weak leadership.” “I mean, Paul Ryan didn’t repeal Obamacare,” she says. (When Ryan was Speaker in 2017, the House did in fact pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it failed in the Senate.) “They didn’t fund and build the wall. And when every Republican there called themselves pro-life, they didn’t do anything about abortion, but they actually funded Planned Parenthood.”\n\n“To me,” she adds, “that’s a complete failure on three fundamental issues.”\n\nFor all the harsh rhetoric, Greene says she’s been trying to dial it back and become more of a team player as she’s gained experience in Congress. “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve definitely made mistakes,” she says. I ask what comes to mind. “Maybe attacking at times when I didn’t need to, when I could have tried talking to them first, but I attacked publicly,” she says. “Kevin McCarthy is one. I’ve attacked other colleagues for their votes.” Then again, she reflects, “I’m not saying I won’t ever do it again. I probably will.”\n\nOne of Matt Gaetz’s favorite mementos is a photo with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal congresswoman from New York and national political celebrity. In the picture, they’re dressed in their congressional garb, standing with big smiles on either side of Father Patrick Conroy, a Jesuit priest and House chaplain, who had asked them to pose for his 2019 Christmas card. (Greene, for her part, recently accused the Catholic Church of being “controlled by Satan” for its work assisting migrants.) “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All!” it says in red script beneath the photo.\n\nBut that was two impeachments and an insurrection ago. Gaetz used to have cordial relationships with some Democrats, finding common ground on issues like antitrust and drug policy. (Once, he and Ocasio-Cortez even teamed up on a failed amendment to promote research of psychedelics.) But few Democrats will even talk to him anymore, he explains mournfully. “It was the populist right and populist left against the neoconservative middle,” Gaetz says. “But all of that functionally ended after Jan. 6.” All the policy affinity in the world, it seems, was no match for one little attempted coup.\n\nGaetz’s brown hair rises from his forehead in a magnificently gelled wave. “Ever since Dave Brat lost, this has been the best hair in Congress,” he boasts, referring to a former Republican representative from Virginia. He’s fascinated by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the left-wing Squad, who he sees as role models for the mastery of asymmetric power. “I have studied carefully the tactics of the Squad, and many are admirable,” he tells me in one of our interviews. “I am very impressed at the ability of a very small number of people to shape the policy goals of the conference. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nRead More: Matt Gaetz Wants To Make Trumpism the New Normal.\n\nIt’s not just the votes the Squad commands, but their ability to use social media, grassroots fundraising and clout with the Democratic base to pressure congressional leadership. Gaetz points to a July 2021 episode in which Democratic Representative Cori Bush of Missouri protested the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium: “Is not one of the greatest flexes of the 117th Congress Cori Bush sleeping on the steps of the Capitol and getting the Biden Administration, in a matter of, like, 48 hours, to totally reverse their position?” he says. “I obviously don’t share the policy goals of Congresswoman Bush, but there’s a freshman congresswoman who, by virtue of a pretty compelling direct action, got the Biden Administration to straight-up flip.”\n\nGaetz considers himself different from other members of Congress. He travels widely, campaigning for other members and candidates, but has held just one fundraiser in the past four years. He doesn’t take money from political action committees—neither corporate PACs nor those associated with advocacy organizations like the National Rifle Association. (Like Greene, Gaetz represents a safe Republican district, Florida’s 1st, which covers the state’s Western Panhandle.) And he prides himself on taking unconventional stands for a Republican. During his time in the Florida legislature, he wrote and passed the state’s laws legalizing gay adoption and medical marijuana. In 2020 he defied Trump to vote with Democrats to limit presidential war powers in Iran, earning a public scolding from McCarthy and Lou Dobbs on Fox News.\n\nGaetz has no interest in running for a leadership position or giving C-SPAN speeches to an empty chamber. “Members of Congress are often actors who are reading out lines and participating in scenes that are produced, directed and written by others,” he says. “They don’t have agency. And often the people who are writing the scripts and producing the plays are donors and lobbyists.”\n\nA few days after the Times published its recording of McCarthy privately telling colleagues in the wake of the Jan. 6 breach that he planned to urge Trump to resign—something he had denied having said just the day before—the paper released another recording from the same time period, in which McCarthy, on a phone call with GOP leadership, singled out Gaetz and accused him of “putting people in jeopardy” by publicly referring to Cheney as “anti-Trump.” In that recording, McCarthy also expressed a wish that members like Boebert, Greene, Brooks and Barry Moore of Alabama might lose their Twitter accounts. He said he had consulted with the FBI and planned to tell Gaetz, “This is serious s–t, cut this out.”\n\nGaetz tells me that McCarthy did subsequently call him, but the conversation went rather differently. “He calls me and says, ‘When you’re talking about other members, I would prefer you not use their names, okay?'” Gaetz recalls. “And I said, ‘When they stop using Trump’s name, I’ll stop using theirs.’ And he said, ‘Well, I asked,’ and I said, ‘Well, agree to disagree.’ The entire call lasted less than 30 seconds.” The interaction, Gaetz says, felt more like a box-checking exercise than a tongue-lashing.\n\nUpon the tapes’ release, Gaetz publicly called McCarthy “weak” and said his comments were “sniveling” and “not worthy of leadership.” On May 28, when Trump held an anti-Cheney rally in Wyoming, McCarthy sent a video message that the crowd roundly jeered.\n\n“I see conditions that are unfavorable to a successful speakership when, at a Donald Trump rally, the leader of the Republican conference was booed on a monitor and likely would have been booed off the stage,” Gaetz tells me. (Gaetz was scheduled to appear at the rally, but his flight was canceled. When he appeared on the monitor, the crowd cheered.) Before the Times tapes, Gaetz tells me, “I don’t think McCarthy would have been booed at a Trump rally. After he talked s–t about me, the boos rained down, and I got a standing ovation.”\n\nIn a normal world, McCarthy’s duplicity might disturb the members he purports to lead. But the bulk of the Republican caucus responded with a shrug—a weird equanimity that only makes sense in the twisted Washington logic of mutual self-preservation, the same peculiar docility with which most GOP politicians accepted Trump’s constant humiliations. McCarthy and Trump both said they had mended fences with no hard feelings. (Trump recently endorsed McCarthy for reelection, but has yet to back him for Speaker.) When McCarthy walked into the caucus meeting immediately following the tapes’ release, he was greeted with a standing ovation and announced, according to Gaetz, that he planned to “lean in” to the controversy, whatever that means. (McCarthy’s office did not dispute Gaetz’s description of his remarks.)\n\nEven Gaetz says he hasn’t ruled out voting for McCarthy for Speaker. He says he wasn’t particularly shocked by the revelation that the leader had lied. “Truth is not really part of the covenant between Republican leadership and the membership,” he says. “It is a covenant based on money. Kevin McCarthy is the most elite fundraiser in the history of the Republican caucus. He is the LeBron James of lobbyist and PAC fundraising. And that is his covenant with the conference.” It would be silly, in his view, to be surprised by McCarthy’s deceptions. “I mean, John Boehner lied to us constantly. Paul Ryan lied to us constantly. What, we thought we were going to get the great truth-teller next?”\n\nHow much power Gaetz and his allies have in the next Congress depends, of course, on how the midterms turn out. He has endorsed and campaigned for numerous House candidates, including Anna Paulina Luna and Anthony Sabatini, both running for open seats in Florida; Joe Kent, a primary challenger to Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who voted to impeach Trump; and Bo Hines, who won his North Carolina primary in May. Most have been endorsed by Trump. Some face McCarthy-backed primary opponents.\n\n“I need backup,” Gaetz says. “If I don’t get a bunch of folks through these primaries and into this expected Republican majority—if [the new GOP members] are all just here to cash the lobbyist checks, shuttle the PAC money to leadership and earn their frivolous attaboys along the way—I don’t have much of a fighting force.”\n\nGaetz says no one has asked for his vote for Speaker, but his ideal candidate would be Representative Jim Jordan, the veteran Ohio right-winger who passionately defended Trump during the first impeachment, and who Gaetz calls “the spiritual and intellectual leader of this conference.” “Where Jim goes, the conference goes,” Gaetz adds. “I don’t even remember who holds which austere titles that append to what corner offices and expanded staff budgets, but they are the followers. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself—we are the leaders.”\n\nJordan has said he supports McCarthy for Speaker and has no plans to run. Then again, anything can happen: McCarthy was in line to become Speaker when Boehner stepped down in 2015, only to be derailed in part by rumors of an affair, and have Ryan take the job instead. “Paul Ryan was for Kevin McCarthy last time Kevin ran for Speaker,” Gaetz says cheekily. “I think one of the first steps to becoming Speaker is initially supporting Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nBut Gaetz, Greene and their fellow travelers argue it would be a mistake to see them merely as a thorn in McCarthy’s side. In fact, these days, they’re pretty pleased with him. When Greene was kicked off her committees, she demanded McCarthy promise to retaliate by removing some Democrats from committees once Republicans take the majority. He immediately agreed. When Gaetz proposed that the prospective Republican majority focus every House committee on oversight of the Biden Administration, McCarthy soon began touting the same idea—in practically the same words. When McCarthy made a recent trip to the southern border, Greene was among the members invited to tag along.\n\n“I frankly have more animosity and disappointment with Kevin McCarthy for enabling her than Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” says a GOP congressional aide. “She’s accruing power and forcing leadership to be subservient to her. She knows really well how to wield power.” Why vote against a man you’ve already got wrapped around your little finger?\n\n“The critique of McCarthy is not that he has ignored us, or pretended like we don’t exist,” Gaetz adds with a broad grin. “In fact, he’s highly responsive to us.”\n\nThe MAGA Squad: They’re here. They’re weird. And pretty soon, they may be in control of the GOP Congress—if they aren’t already.\n\nWith reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian""}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-tweets-testimony/', 'Headline': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene to Jan. 6: I Don’t Know Her - VICE', 'Snippet': 'Marjorie Taylor Greene has an absolutely terrible memory, and very little control over her social media accounts. ...

That’s her story, anyway.\n\nIn a mint-green dress with a gold cross displayed prominently, the Georgia congresswoman appeared in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to testify under oath about whether she participated in an insurrection. “I don’t remember,” and “I don’t recall,” Greene testified repeatedly to straightforward questions on whether she’d talked about the Jan. 6 protest with other members of Congress, or any “Stop the Steal” organizers before the Capitol riot.\n\nGreene is facing a challenge from a group of constituents in her northwest Georgia district who say her alleged role in the violent Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol should disqualify her from running for re-election. The challenge was brought under a Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment that says officials who engage in “insurrection or rebellion” or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” should be barred from holding political office.\n\nThe question at the heart of the case is what an insurrection looks like in the year 2021—whether the Capitol riot fits that definition, and whether Greene’s words and conduct before, during, and after the attack make her culpable.\n\nFriday’s proceedings marked the first time a member of Congress has testified publicly, under oath, about their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nAdministrative law judge Charles Beaudrot agreed to recognize the congresswoman as a “hostile witness,” after she repeatedly refused to answer or evaded questions about her social media posts and belief in the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump.\n\nGreene even dodged questions about how she uses Twitter and Facebook and said she couldn’t recall specific incendiary messages she shared from her social media accounts prior to Jan. 6.\n\nShe also repeated false claims about a “tremendous amount of voter fraud” in the 2020 election, but asserted that it was “not accurate” that she hoped Congress would not certify Joe Biden as the election’s winner.\n\nGreene’s supporters packed the courtroom and cheered when she entered. They also clapped when Beaudrot dismissed the court for a break later in the morning. “This is not a show,” Beaudrot scolded them. “Do not do that.” Notable among Greene’s supporters present was Rep. Matt Gaetz, a right-wing congressman from Florida.\n\n“This was not a case where leaders were on horseback leading the charge,” said Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, a left-leaning civil liberties group, who cross-examined Greene. “The leaders were not standing in Richmond, Virginia, giving long-winded speeches to justify the mayhem. The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Twitter, on Facebook. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.”\n\nGreene’s attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the legal challenge a “political smear” campaign against the controversial congresswoman, and asserted that Fein was glossing over key legal definitions of “insurrection” or “engaged.”\n\nFein asked Greene whether she thought if someone “broke the law in a way designed to interfere with the process of counting Electoral College votes,” would they be “an enemy of the constitution.”\n\n“You mean interrupting Congress?” replied Greene. “Interrupting Congress, like when the Democrats interrupted Congress and staged a sit-in?”\n\nShe also testified that she had no expectation of violence on Jan. 6. “I have never once seen violence from Trump people,” she claimed. “The only violence I had seen from antifa and BLM rallies.”\n\nFein, amid numerous objections from Bopp, grilled Greene about specific social media posts and past remarks—and likes of posts.\n\n“You’ve had your disagreements with [Nancy] Pelosi, right?” asked Fein.\n\n“Politically speaking, that would be correct,” Greene replied.\n\n“You don’t agree on a lot of things?” asked Fein. “Politically speaking, that would be correct,” she repeated.\n\n“You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country,” he said. “I’m not answering that question; it’s speculation,” she said.\n\nFein then pulled up an exhibit that showed Greene saying Pelosi was “a traitor to our country, guilty of treason.” He also asked her about a Facebook comment she appeared to “like” that said a “bullet to the head” would be a quicker way to remove Pelosi from office. “I have had many people manage my social media account,” said Greene, adding that she didn’t know who liked that one.\n\n“Are you testifying under oath that wasn’t you?” asked Fein.\n\n“I am testifying I had no idea who liked that comment,” Greene replied.\n\nFein also pointed to a CNN article (prompting snickers from the courtroom), quoting 2019 remarks by Greene (in the context of a protest to fund the Southern border wall), in which she said a good way for people to express their displeasure with the government is to “flood the Capitol.”\n\n“The Capitol belongs to the people,” she replied. When Fein read out additional comments from 2019 where Greene talked about the need to “rise up” and hoping “the American people” wouldn’t be forced to use non-peaceful means, she denied making them.\n\nGreene called Fein a “conspiracy theorist” by reading statements that were quoted in CNN, and said that the news outlet regularly prints lies about her. Fein then played a video that showed her making those same remarks, verbatim.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-tracker/', 'Headline': 'WATCH: Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz boot ... - Raw Story', 'Snippet': 'Rep.

She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/12/21/house-gop-report-faults-nancy-pelosi-for-jan-6-security-failures/', 'Headline': 'House GOP report faults Nancy Pelosi for Jan. 6 security failures', 'Snippet': 'House Republicans issued a scathing report Wednesday exposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s key role in the catastrophic security and intelligence failures that left the US Capitol vulnerable to a violent attack on January 6, 2021.', 'Full_text': 'House Republicans issued a scathing report Wednesday exposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s key role in the catastrophic security and intelligence failures that left the US Capitol vulnerable to a violent attack on January 6, 2021.\n\nDays after Pelosi’s Jan. 6 select committee recommended insurrection charges against former president Donald Trump over the Capitol riot, Republicans have hit back with a counter-investigation apportioning blame for the internal security breakdown on Jan. 6 to Pelosi and a dysfunctional Capitol Police intelligence division.\n\n“Leadership and law enforcement failures within the U.S. Capitol left the complex vulnerable on January 6, 2021,” says the report, which is based on a trove of texts and email messages, and testimony from Capitol Police leaders and rank-and-file officers.\n\nHouse Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, who answered to Pelosi as one of three voting members of the Capitol Police Board, “succumbed to political pressures from the Office of Speaker Pelosi and House Democrat leadership,” was “compromised by politics and did not adequately prepare for violence at the Capitol.”\n\nPelosi and her staff “coordinated closely” with Irving on security plans for the Joint Session of Congress on Jan. 6, but Republicans were deliberately left out of “important discussions related to security.”\n\nAnd, in an apparent attempt to hide from Republicans the fact that they were being excluded from discussions, Irving asked a senior Democratic staffer to “act surprised” when he sent “key information about plans for the Joint Session on Jan. 6, 2021, to him and his Republican counterpart.”\n\nThe staffer replied sardonically: “I’m startled!”\n\nThe report also claims that “staff within the House Sergeant at Arms office emailed Paul Irving that January 6th was Pelosi’s fault,” although it provides no evidence for the assertion.\n\nWhen Irving was forced to resign after the riot, an email from an unnamed staffer in his office criticized Pelosi’s “knee-jerk reaction to yesterday’s unprecedented event” and described his resignation as “spectacularly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted. This is not your fault. Or [Capitol Police chief Steven] Sund’s fault.”\n\nThe Republicans responsible for the withering report — Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Troy Nehls (R-TX) — are the five congressmen originally nominated to sit on the Jan. 6 committee, until Pelosi vetoed Banks and Jordan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the rest of his nominees in protest. Pelosi then installed two Never Trump Republican outcasts, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nGiven Pelosi’s assiduous grooming of Cheney, no doubt it suited both their interests to focus the final Jan.6 committee report on Trump — and not on Pelosi’s culpability.\n\nBut now the Republicans Pelosi rejected have skewered her in their rival report, dredging up some of what she tried to hide, despite complaining of obstruction from the personnel she controls.\n\nThe report insinuates that the Speaker left the Capitol Police without backup on Jan. 6 because “widespread concern from Democratic leadership over ‘optics’ in the aftermath of the Summer 2020 ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard.”\n\nChief Sund begged repeatedly for troops but has testified that Irving rebuffed him over concern about “optics.” During the violence on Jan. 6, Sund repeated his request, but help was delayed until after the riot ended, because Irving needed to run it up the chain of command, a.k.a. Pelosi.\n\n“The Speaker’s office was heavily involved in planning and decision-making before and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and micromanaged the Sergeant at Arms.”\n\nFrom early December 2020, Pelosi aides attended regular meetings with Irving and Sund to discuss the security plan. So hands-on was Pelosi’s chief of staff Terri McCullough that, at one point, she was editing details of parking, event timing and “language regarding official business visitors” for the Joint Session.\n\nTo illustrate the intense involvement of Pelosi’s office, on Jan. 6 alone, the report records 36 communications between Irving and Pelosi staffers, including 11 with McCullough, and 20 with Jamie Fleet, a Pelosi aide who doubled as a Democratic staff director.\n\nPelosi’s repeated assertions that she has “no power over the Capitol Police” are rejected.\n\n“This is false,” says the report. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff . . .\n\n“House Rules dictate . . . that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”\n\nIndeed, the report says that Pelosi regularly exercised her authority over security matters, “when she directed the use of magnetometers outside the House chamber in the name of safety . . . Similarly, she required masks in the House chamber [and] exerted influence on security protocols at the Capitol related to the perimeter fence . . . She also oversaw the fencing that was erected for a purported rally on September 18, 2021, that never materialized.”\n\nThe report of the Republican refuseniks is an appetizer to potential future investigations next year when they regain subpoena power. It makes sensible recommendations to prevent another disaster, including reform and oversight of the Capitol Police Board.\n\nFar from being a revenge ploy, it identifies security flaws it claims have not been remedied, including the breakdown of intelligence that had the Capitol Police (USCP) flying blind and hopelessly outnumbered when “criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with … the Joint Session of Congress.”\n\nThe Capitol Police Intelligence Division “failed to warn USCP leadership and line officers about the threat of violence,” despite having “obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence.”\n\nIn fact, the final intelligence threat assessment three days before the riot did warn of a violent scenario in which “Congress itself” could be attacked by armed Trump supporters. But the warning was buried towards the end of the 15-page document and was not included in the up-front summary, so was overlooked. Nor was the warning mentioned in three subsequent daily intelligence reports.\n\nThe Republicans blame much of the intelligence failure on the assistant director of the USCP intelligence division, Julie Farnam, who had joined the Capitol Police from the Department of Homeland Security only 10 weeks before the riot.\n\nAnalysts testified that “the section became ‘nonfunctional’ immediately upon Farnam’s arrival as she tried to “consolidate power for herself to the detriment of the safety and security of the Capitol.”\n\n“Documents and testimony show that, immediately upon joining the USCP, and without time to acclimate, Farnam began to dismantle the systems that had kept the Capitol safe for so long,” the report alleges.\n\n“Information about planned protests and threats of violence were siloed and not properly analyzed and disseminated during this key period because of Farnam’s misplaced priorities.”\n\nOne analyst testified: “at the time of January 6, we were not doing proactive searches of social media like we had been before. We were strictly reactive.”\n\nAs a result, USCP leadership “were not fully informed about the severity of the threats against the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021”.\n\nHowever, Farnam told CBS this year that her team does not bear any responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and provided adequate threat assessments to police leadership before the riot.\n\n“I think we did an excellent job . . . I am the one who has worked tirelessly . . . to right this ship.”\n\nAfter cataloguing so many tragic failures, the report concludes on a poignant note with messages to Irving from friends in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol.\n\n“You’re quite something to take this one for the team, Paul, as they say. I know how these things work and you know I do, too.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.”', 'Full_text': 'Trump’s Speech. In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'Newly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol.

It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year.

This is Nancy,” Pelosi said in a call to Virginia Gov.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Pence about the “backup plan,” and officials tried to figure out how they’d transport hundreds of lawmakers to the Army base.\n\nThe extended raw footage shines a devastating light on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction during the riot. Lawmakers are seen working around Trump to secure any help they could get – from the National Guard, federal agencies and local police departments – to defeat the mob he incited.\n\nThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House. The filmmaker provided some of her behind-the-scenes footage to the January 6 select committee, which aired an edited compilation at Thursday’s hearing.\n\n“Everyone involved was working actively to stop the violence, to get federal law enforcement deployed to the scene to put down the violence and secure the Capitol complex,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said about the footage at the hearing. “All of them did what President Trump was not doing, what he simply refused to do.”\n\nIt has been known since January 6, 2021, that congressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol. But prior to Thursday, the public has seen very little footage from inside the base, and the new tapes show for the first time Pelosi’s rushed exit from the Capitol and into an SUV that took her to the base.\n\nThe new clips show chaotic scenes of Democrats and Republicans working the phones at Fort McNair, sometimes together, trying to figure out what was going on at the overrun Capitol, and begging for help.\n\nIn one dramatic scene, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer shouted at the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, after hearing a rumor that Trump blocked the DC National Guard from rushing to the Capitol.\n\n“I’d like to know a good God damn reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer said. “Please – the whole Capitol is rampaged. There is a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We’ve all been evacuated. There have been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component, now.”\n\nMcCarthy then assures Schumer that there was no stand-down order for the National Guard.\n\nAnd in another shocking moment, Schumer and Pelosi are seen chewing out the acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. In a heated phone call, Schumer told Rosen that federal authorities should “make arrests, starting now,” but Rosen only offered a halting, non-committal response.\n\n“Um, I have to defer to law enforcement on that,” Rosen replied.\n\n‘Don’t let anybody know where you are’\n\nMost of the raw footage shows Pelosi’s movements on January 6, and Alexandra Pelosi’s documentary crew provided CNN with timestamps for the videos. Perhaps the most consequential revelations are the phone calls between Pence and Pelosi, who were first and second in the line of succession.\n\nTheir first call in the footage happened around 4:20 p.m. ET. Pelosi asks Pence about his well-being and his physical safety, before discussing the possibility of resuming the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair, so lawmakers could complete the ceremonial process of finalizing Biden’s victory.\n\n“We’re at Fort McNair, which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet, as a backup plan … should anything happen that would warrant that,” Pelosi says. “We’d rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn’t seem to be safe.”\n\nPelosi went on to tell Pence that she had been told it would take “days” for the Capitol to be secured, and thus, “we logistically want to bring all the members here, House and Senate.” But that never materialized: rank-and-file lawmakers and congressional staffers stayed inside the Capitol throughout the siege, with many barricading themselves in their offices.\n\n“I worry about you being in that Capitol room,” Pelosi tells Pence, who was holed up in a loading dock underneath the Capitol with his security detail. “Don’t let anybody know where you are.”\n\nPelosi tells the vice president that she heard reports of “defecation” on the House floor.\n\nThe House speaker says she consulted with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about trying to “expedite” the GOP objections to President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral votes, so they could raise one objection and then “move forward” with the election certification. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, opposed the objections but several Trump-aligned GOP senators were still trying to nullify Biden’s victories in several key states.\n\nDuring the call, Pelosi unwraps a beef jerky stick and eats it, while holding the phone with her other hand.\n\n‘If he comes, I’m going to punch him out’\n\nEarlier in the previously unseen footage, on the morning of January 6, Pelosi participates in a video call with the House Democratic caucus to plan out the day’s proceedings. A devout Catholic, Pelosi invokes the Feast of the Epiphany, which is on January 6, and says she hoped that Republicans “would have their own epiphany” that day.\n\nThe call took place in Pelosi’s same conference room that was ransacked just a few hours later by riotous Trump supporters, some of whom specifically said they wanted to hunt her down.\n\nPelosi is later seen reacting to Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, where he told his supporters to march to the Capitol, and said he’d be there with them to protest the election certification.\n\n“Tell him, if he comes here, we’re going to the White House,” Pelosi quips, with a laugh.\n\nThen, Pelosi’s chief of staff notifies her that the Secret Service “dissuaded (Trump) from coming to Capitol Hill.” It’s unclear how the aide learned this. But the footage backs up the testimony of Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump’s attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: “If he comes, I’m going to punch him out. I’ve been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I’m going to punch him out. And I’m going to go to jail, and I’m going to be happy.”\n\n‘We have got to finish the proceedings’\n\nAs Pelosi exits her office and heads to the House chamber, the footage shows congressional aides carrying the all-important boxes containing the official Electoral College certificates. The proceedings begin, with Pence presiding, and GOP lawmakers quickly file their first objection.\n\nThrongs of Trump supporters soon started swarming the Capitol complex. The shaky video footage shows Pelosi and her entourage of staff and family members getting whisked away from the building, escaping the fast-approaching rioters and descending down a narrow staircase\n\n“If they stop the proceedings, we will have totally failed,” Pelosi says, as she evacuated the Capitol, adding later, “We have got to finish the proceedings, or else they will have a complete victory.”\n\nOn her way out, she asks aides if they were able to reach McConnell, and whether he was on board to jointly request emergency assistance from the National Guard. (He was, they said.)\n\nResettled at Fort McNair, Pelosi learns that some House members were trapped in the chamber and were instructed by security officials to put on their government-issued gas masks. Pelosi and her colleagues later watch the riot unfolding on CNN, the footage shows. They were visibly shaken by the TV coverage.\n\n‘One hell of a hurry’\n\nThe extended footage obtained by CNN shows congressional leaders from both parties taking refuge at Fort McNair.\n\nDemocratic leaders Pelosi and Schumer, as well as top-ranking Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, are seen throughout the raw footage. They were joined by top Republicans, like McConnell, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Sen John Thune of South Dakota and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, is also in the footage, taking refuge at Fort McNair. His presence is notable considering his trajectory after the insurrection: McCarthy confronted Trump in a heated call during the attack, and directly blamed Trump in the immediate aftermath, but days later re-embraced Trump and began downplaying the riot.\n\nOne scene from the footage, around 3:18 p.m. ET, shows some of the senior Democratic officials talking again with Ryan McCarthy, the Army secretary. Schumer was apparently under the impression that the military response was impeded.\n\n“I never said no,” Ryan McCarthy says, about activating the National Guard. “I just had to get permission.” Without naming any names, Ryan McCarthy then tells the lawmakers that he “had to talk to my boss.” It’s not clear who the Army leader was referring to, but acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was technically his boss.\n\nMiller did not speak with Trump on January 6, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. Miller did speak that day with Pence, who took on an impromptu leadership role that day, working with congressional leaders and Capitol security officials, and the footage clearly shows Pence coordinating with Pelosi about the efforts to secure the Capitol.\n\nRoughly 30 minutes later, approximately 10 lawmakers huddle around a phone in a bipartisan scrum to speak with Miller, the acting Defense secretary. Schumer presses Miller on the slow National Guard response, and informed Miller that some senators were trapped in their hideaway offices near the breached Senate chamber.\n\nMcConnell tells Miller that troops need to be “getting there in one hell of a hurry, you understand?”\n\n“This is an emergency,” Schumer says, “where life and limb are at stake.”\n\nThe acting Pentagon chief tells the lawmakers that he got the message “loud and clear,” the troops had already been activated, and that plans to retake the Capitol were being devised by military leaders.\n\n‘Answer my question!’\n\nThe clips show Pelosi speaking with then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, about sending troops, because he could directly activate the Virginia National Guard without presidential involvement. She additionally spoke with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, another Democrat, whose police department was on the frontlines that day.\n\nThere was also the showdown with Rosen, the acting attorney general. Schumer yells into his flip phone, castigating Rosen, and urges him to tell Trump to call off the mob. Rosen had little to offer Schumer, except to say he was mobilizing federal agents under his purview. Pelosi tells Rosen that the rioters were “breaking the law … at the instigation of the President of the United States.”\n\nRosen says his team was “coordinating as quickly and as–” before getting cut off by Schumer, who forcefully asks Rosen again if he will intervene directly with Trump.\n\n“No, no, no – please answer my question,” Schumer shouts. “Answer my question!”\n\nAt that time, Schumer likely didn’t know Rosen’s relationship with Trump had deteriorated, and that Rosen was less of a Trump loyalist and more of an ally supporting the transfer of power.\n\nDays earlier, Trump had threatened to fire Rosen and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official who was willing to do what Rosen wouldn’t: Use the powers of federal law enforcement to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in power.\n\n“Mr. President, you’re right that I’m not going to allow the Justice Department to do anything to try to overturn the election,” Rosen told Trump during that high-stakes Oval Office meeting on January 3, 2021, according to his testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\n‘Continue democracy here on base’\n\nAs late as 4:30 p.m. ET, top congressional leaders were talking with McCarthy, the Army secretary, about completing the joint session of Congress at Fort McNair.\n\n“We must finish,” Schumer said, “but you have to help us make that decision.”\n\nSchumer and others later discuss the logistics of shuttling hundreds of lawmakers to Fort McNair. Pelosi wonders aloud if there were microphones they could use. Officials tried to resolve the big questions: How would lawmakers get bussed from the Capitol to Fort McNair? Where would they go after certification is completed? How would they get home safely?\n\nIn what looked like an impromptu briefing, a US Capitol Police officer provides some logistical answers to the senior lawmakers, for how they could “continue democracy here on base.”\n\nBut the congressional leaders were also wary, and Schumer said the Fort McNair backup plan would look like “we’re abandoning the Capitol to insurrectionists.”\n\nBy the evening, police had expelled most of the rioters and started establishing a secure perimeter around the Capitol. Pelosi gets on the phone again with Pence around 6 p.m. ET, and the vice president had some good news for the congressional leaders, who were hoping to get back into the Capitol.\n\n“I am literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police,” Pence said on speakerphone, as Pelosi, Schumer and Grassley listened. “And he just informed me, that their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour.”\n\nWith that, the Fort McNair “backup plan” was called off.\n\n‘There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby’\n\nSoon after, Pelosi speaks with then-House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving. In the previously undisclosed conversation, Irving confirms that lawmakers can soon return, but some areas will be off-limits, because they are a “crime scene.”\n\n“There is blood outside the Speaker’s Lobby,” Irving says, referring to the area immediately off the House floor where Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nThe footage shows Pelosi leaving Fort McNair and driving through the dark streets of DC toward the Capitol. The Senate reconvened around 8 p.m. ET and the House reconvened around 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump’s staunchest congressional allies pushed ahead with their challenges against Biden’s electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their objections, based on meritless claims of fraud, were defeated in bipartisan votes. The 2020 election formally came to a close.\n\nThe new footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, who has released documentaries on HBO for decades.

But for his words, and deeds, it wouldn’t have happened,” said Heaphy, who led many of the key witness interviews conducted by the committee. “That said, what happened at the Capitol was also affected by law enforcement failures to operationalize the ample intelligence that was present before Jan. 6, about the threats of violence.”\n\nHe added, “Law enforcement had a very direct role in contributing to the security failures that led to the violence.”\n\nFor more on this story, tune in to NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT or check your local listings.\n\nCommittee investigators found that the Capitol was inadequately defended on Jan. 6 not because of an intelligence failure, Heaphy said, but because of a failure to act on intelligence showing that extremists intended to come to Washington and use violence to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s election victory.\n\n“There was a lot of advance intelligence about law enforcement, about carrying weapons, about the vulnerability of the Capitol,” he said. “The intel in advance was pretty specific, and it was enough, in our view, for law enforcement to have done a better job.”\n\nWhile many lawmakers and outside experts have reached that conclusion, it hasn’t been previously reported that the most comprehensive investigation into the Capitol riot did so, too. It’s also notable that the lawmakers on the committee chose to downplay — and in some cases contradict — that finding.\n\nHeaphy has not previously spoken publicly about the findings of the Blue Team, the group of committee investigators who spent more than a year reviewing the performance of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the Capitol Police, the Department of Defense and Washington’s police with regard to the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nThe Blue Team was led by senior investigative counsel Soumya Dayananda, who once helped prosecute Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the Mexican former drug lord. She declined to comment.\n\nThe team's findings were not presented in any of the committee’s televised hearings. An abbreviated version, stripped of details and analytical judgments, was included in an appendix to the written report. But the report said that, ultimately, law enforcement could not have anticipated what Trump would do and therefore could not be blamed.\n\nHeaphy offered a somewhat different view, saying investigators found that both Trump’s actions and law enforcement failures had played a significant role.\n\nHeaphy said investigators also found:\n\nThe Capitol Police failed to deploy enough force to defend the building, but the FBI and DHS, the federal agencies charged with collecting intelligence about domestic extremists, didn’t do enough to sound the alarm about the threat.\n\nThe FBI and DHS were too cautious about exploiting “open source” intelligence gleaned from social media out of misplaced concern about free speech violations.\n\nThe FBI and DHS made a crucial error by not publishing a Joint Intelligence Bulletin about the threats they were seeing, which might have prompted a more robust defense of the Capitol.\n\nThere was confusion about which federal agency was in charge, hampering the response once the Capitol was breached.\n\nHeaphy said he agrees with what Washington, D.C.’s National Guard commander, William Walker, told the committee: The response would have been much different, before and during the attack, “if these protesters were Black and brown.”\n\nHeaphy also played a key role in the committee’s investigation of Trump and the decision to recommend the Justice Department charge Trump with crimes.\n\nIn a forward to the final committee report, Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., wrote that “the shortfall of communications, intelligence and law enforcement around January 6th was much less about what they did or did not know” than what they could not know — that the president would “incit(e) a mob to march on the Capitol and impede the work of Congress.”\n\nHe added, “Whatever weaknesses existed in the policies, procedures, or institutions, they were not to blame for what happened on that day.”\n\nAsked about what Thompson wrote, Heaphy said, “It is certainly correct to say law enforcement could not have expected the president of the United States to incite violence directly like he did. There’s no question that this was relatively unprecedented … That said, there were plenty of indications that there could be violence, and law enforcement could have and should have done a better job of anticipating that.”\n\nThompson did not respond to a request for comment. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the committee vice chairman, had no comment through a spokesman. People familiar with the committee’s inner workings told NBC News that the findings about intelligence and security shortcomings were left out of the public hearings and downplayed in the report because committee members wanted to keep the focus on Trump and avoid giving his supporters a talking point. Also given short shrift were the findings of the Purple Team, which examined the role of social media and didn’t even make the report’s appendices.\n\nAsked whether he wished the committee had a public hearing about security shortcomings, Heaphy declined to discuss internal deliberations. He pointed out that the committee’s move to make public its interview transcripts put a lot of evidence about law enforcement failures on the public record.\n\nThe committee posted interview transcripts and supporting materials on a website, but wading through them to draw conclusions will be a laborious task for academics and journalists, let alone members of the public.\n\n‘Please, please take this tip seriously’\n\nHeaphy said it was crucial for the public to understand not only Trump’s role, but why the government was unable to defend the seat of American democracy from a mob.\n\n“When you make mistakes, ideally, you’ll learn from them,” he said. “And this was a mistake.”\n\nHe said committee investigators reviewed numerous examples of compelling intelligence that appeared to have been downplayed or ignored. Much of the material has already become public, because much of it was posted publicly in the first place. Once researchers began to look for it after the riot, it wasn’t hard to find.\n\nThe committee found that 10 days before Jan. 6, the FBI created a unique tag within its Guardian threat tracking system to cover intelligence about possible threats to the Congressional electoral vote count that day. The code was “CERTUNREST.”\n\nOne of the tips entered in Guardian on Dec. 27 came from a person who was reading traffic on a website called the Donald.win, a hive of Jan. 6 rhetoric.\n\n“They think that they will have a large enough group to march into DC armed and will outnumber the police so they can’t be stopped,” the tipster wrote. “They believe that since the election was ‘stolen’ that it’s their constitutional right to overtake the government and during this coup no US laws apply ... Their plan is to literally kill people. Please please take this tip seriously and investigate further.”\n\nAsked on the web form to describe what kind of attack was being reported, the tipster wrote: “Attempted coup/terrorist attack on Jan 6th.”\n\nIn another example, as NBC News first reported in 2021, the New York Police Department sent both the Secret Service and the Capitol Police a compilation of social media posts about threats to the Capitol from the SITE intelligence group. The intelligence report was later made public.\n\nProtesters should “start marching into the chambers,” one poster wrote.\n\n“[T]here is not enough cops in DC to stop what is coming,” wrote another.\n\n“[B]e already in place when Congress tries to get to their meeting,” said another. “[M]ake sure they know who to fear.’”\n\nPeople familiar with the committee’s work told NBC News that investigators found the only agency that mobilized in anticipation of violence on Jan. 6 was Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAlmost 900 D.C. police officers responded directly to the U.S. Capitol during the attack, followed by 400 officers from neighboring police forces that D.C. police had asked to be pre-positioned to help.\n\nBy contrast, the committee investigators found that federal law enforcement agencies were not postured to respond immediately to the Capitol and did not deploy a large response — about 260 officers. That included 10 from the U.S. Park Police, 24 from DHS, 35 from the FBI, 35 from the Secret Service and 86 from the U.S. Marshals. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms deployed 70 people largely to deal with pipe bombs planted at Republican and Democratic headquarters.\n\nAgencies respond\n\nFederal agencies have responded differently to the criticism. The FBI has forcefully defended itself, suggesting it did everything it could. The bureau also said last year, however, that it has “increased our focus on swift information sharing with all our state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners” and had “improved automated systems established to assist investigators and analysts in all of our 56 field offices throughout the investigative process.”\n\nCurrent and former FBI officials told NBC News the bureau has learned lessons from the riot. During Biden’s January 2021 inauguration, for example, the FBI stepped up security preparations and sent more senior officials to oversee security preparations, the officials say.\n\nIn testimony to the committee, Jennifer Moore, the top FBI intelligence analyst in the Washington, D.C., field office, pushed back on the idea that an FBI bulletin about threats to the Capitol would have made a difference.\n\n“It wouldn’t have changed how we postured ourselves,” Moore said. “Regardless of that piece of paper that said we got a lot of social media, there’s a lot of people coming to D.C., looks like they might want to do some violence ... I would have had my assets exactly posed exactly as they were.”\n\nDHS, by contrast, agreed with a March report by its inspector general that concluded its intelligence division “was unable to provide its many state, local and Federal partners with timely, actionable, and predictive intelligence prior to the U.S. Capitol breach on January 6, 2021” despite ample threat information.\n\nDHS officials said they have since overhauled their collection and assessment of open-source information. The threshold for reporting threats has been lowered and the intelligence now reaches more senior officials, they said.\n\nThe Capitol Police, under new leadership, has vowed to improve its approach to both intelligence analysis and critical incident response.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said that in the lead-up to Jan. 6, the bureau “was actively engaged in gathering intelligence, disrupting travel, and sharing information with our partners. The FBI specifically warned state, local, and federal partners about the potential for violence at the January 6 events.”\n\nThe FBI added: “Since Jan. 6, 2021, the FBI has continuously reviewed our processes, procedures, and policies in order to assess lessons learned and make improvements in communication and in the collection, analysis, and sharing of information.”\n\nThe FBI’s position appears to have evolved since the days after Jan. 6, when the head of its Washington field office told reporters there was no intelligence that the protesters would be anything but peaceful. When reams of social media posts began to emerge showing Trump supporters vowing violence, the bureau began to say the intelligence was not specific and credible enough.\n\nHeaphy said that suggests a problem with the FBI approaching domestic terror as primarily a law enforcement matter, rather than also an intelligence collection target.\n\n“Even if individual tips don’t, by themselves, provide enough specific and credible information to take an investigative step, take a step back. If there are 50 such tips, aggregate intelligence suggests, ‘Hey, maybe we have a problem,’” Heaphy said. “That was the failure here.”\n\nFor example, the FBI, DHS, Secret Service and Capitol Police were all aware of intelligence suggesting a huge uptick in traffic on a website with information about the Capitol’s tunnels.\n\nThe intelligence included social media posts such as “this is where we infiltrate,” and “when our elected representatives try and flee, they will emerge out of these end points.”\n\nMoore, the FBI intel official, told the committee the bureau concluded there was nothing it could do in response.\n\n“So talking about the tunnels, there’s nothing illegal about it,” said Moore. “[W]ithout it being very specific violence towards the tunnels, we can’t take action or do that next step.”\n\nMoore also explained how the FBI views its constraints when it comes to social media.\n\n“People’s First Amendment rights, obviously, are protected. We cannot … just troll the internet looking for things that’s out there,” she said. “It would have to be with such specificity and such planning and such detail that we would be able to open a case.”\n\nHeaphy said the bureau should do more, short of a criminal investigation.\n\n“To me, it is not violating anybody’s rights to reach out to them based on something that they post publicly,” he said. “Sometimes a knock on the door and an inquiry as to intention can have a deterrent effect. The bureau doesn’t, in my view, do that enough. They didn’t do that enough before Jan. 6.”\n\nLaw enforcement officials told NBC News they are under constant pressure from Congress and civil liberties groups to be conservative about exploiting public social media for intelligence purposes. They operate under strict guidelines that stem from the scandals of the 1970s, when the FBI was caught spying on Americans.\n\nBut before Jan. 6, finding threats on social media didn’t require intrusion. They were plentiful.\n\nOne set of communications reviewed by the committee, but not recounted in the final report, showed that just after noon on Jan. 5, 2021, Valerie Hasberry, security chief for the architect of the Capitol, forwarded a Dataminr alert to the Capitol Police incident command.\n\nIt showed a tweet calling on thousands to “go to Washington Jan 6 and help storm the Capital,” adding “we will storm the government buildings, kill cops, kill security guards, kill federal employees and agents.”\n\n“[M]y gut feel, my instinct is, again, based on everything you’re hearing, it wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility that this was someone who actually planned on doing harm,” Hasberry told the committee.\n\nThe response came 58 minutes later, she told the committee: “There is no talk about any credible threats or storming the Capitol.”""}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/15/january-6-video-pelosi-schumer-capitol-security-ac360-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': 'New video shows Pelosi and Schumer talking with Army official on January 6', 'Snippet': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.', 'Full_text': 'New video from the January 6 insurrection shows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussing security at the Capitol ahead of the vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-jan-6-committee-shows-new-footage-of-capitol-attack', 'Headline': 'WATCH: Jan. 6 committee shows new footage of Capitol attack', 'Snippet': 'House investigators are making the case to the American public in a prime-time hearing that the violent insurrection by President Donald Trump’s supporters should not be forgotten.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country.

Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the horrific mass shootings that happen with alarming frequency in the United States.\n\nThe President said last week during a trip to Buffalo, New York, after a mass shooting took place at a grocery store there that there was “not much on executive action” that he could do to further strengthen gun control measures. He said he needed to instead “convince Congress” to pass legislation like the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nAfter 19 children and two teachers were killed Tuesday at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a visibly shaken Biden pleaded with Congress to “turn this pain into action.” But proposals to overhaul gun laws face steep odds due to Republican opposition.\n\n“Will there be more executive actions and will we do more? We’ll look into that. We’re always looking to do more,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. “But right now we need the help of Congress. We need them to step in.”\n\nGun violence prevention organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady have praised the numerous executive actions the President has taken on guns since taking office, including to curb the use of so-called ghost guns and bolster community violence intervention programs.\n\nBut there are several further actions they say they would like to see the President take:\n\nClarification from the Department of Justice\n\nFederal law requires anyone “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms to obtain a federal firearms license and run background checks on potential firearms purchasers. One option available to Biden is directing the Department of Justice to clarify that those “engaged in the business” also includes people selling guns at gun shows or online marketplaces in order to close loopholes.\n\n“Just like we don’t have one airport line for people willing to be screened and another for those who would rather skip it, we can’t allow individuals selling multiple guns for profit to continue peddling guns to complete strangers with no questions asked,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told CNN.\n\nNew White House office and coordinator on guns\n\nSeveral groups, including the gun violence prevention organization Brady, have been advocating for the creation of an office of gun violence prevention within the White House and the appointment of a coordinator within the Department of Justice to oversee all administration efforts to curb gun violence.\n\n“So many of this administration’s executive actions and directives have required DOJ to be focused on the impact of gun violence in America. There should be a coordinator within DOJ that is solely focused on working to end gun violence,” the vice president of policy at Brady, Christian Heyne, told CNN.\n\nMaking more data public\n\nHeyne said he would like to see the Biden administration issue language making it clear that firearm trace data should be made public in order to better understand how to stop the flow of illegal guns. He said “harmful interpretations” of the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment restricts the public’s ability to obtain information about trace data. Because of restrictions in the amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data.\n\n“It is a basic accountability issue,” Josh Horwitz, the co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins, told CNN.\n\nEnforcement of existing “red flag” laws\n\nHorwitz said the Biden administration could also prioritize funding to support the enforcement of extreme risk protection orders, which are also known as “red flag” law. The orders allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. He noted the effectiveness of the orders to prevent acts of violence depends completely on implementation and enforcement.\n\nAction Biden has already taken on guns\n\nSince taking office, the White House has unveiled several packages of executive actions to rein in so-called ghost guns, promote safe storage of firearms, bolster police forces and expand community violence intervention programs:\n\nGhost guns\n\nBiden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate. Ghost gun kits can be bought online and the weapon can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe rules require anyone purchasing a kit to undergo a background check and requires those selling the kits to mark components with a serial number. It also mandates firearm dealers add a serial number to ghost guns that have already been assembled.\n\nGhost guns make up a relatively small share of the guns recovered by law enforcement but officials say the weapons have become more common at crime scenes in recent years.\n\nPromoting safe storage of firearms\n\nBiden unveiled a new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy last year that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers.\n\nThe plan includes a federal focus on improving lethal means safety, which is a voluntary practice to reduce one’s suicide risk by limiting access to objects that can be used to cause self-harm, including medications, firearms or sharp instruments.\n\nThe President directed the Department of Justice to announce a new rule clarifying the obligations firearm dealers have to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. Biden also directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to issue a best practices guide to all federal firearm dealers to remind them about steps they are legally required to take to keep communities safe.\n\nOther Justice Department actions\n\nLast summer, the Justice Department launched an anti-gun trafficking initiative focused on Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, DC, which are known corridors in which illegal guns are being trafficked and used in deadly shootings and other crimes. The goal of the strike forces is to better coordinate law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to disrupt trafficking networks.\n\nThe Justice Department proposed to clarify the restrictions on stabilizing braces that transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. The makeshift short-barreled rifles were used in two mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBiden directed the Justice Department to publish model “red flag” laws for states that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nBolstering law enforcement and community violence intervention programs\n\nThe $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, or the American Rescue Plan, allocated $350 billion to states, local governments, territories and tribes. The administration says that funding is available for law enforcement purposes as well as to expand community violence intervention programs.\n\nThe White House in July also established the White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative, which is a group that includes mayors, law enforcement and community violence intervention experts. The group says it is examining how to best use American Rescue Plan funding and other public funding to increase investments in “community violence intervention infrastructure.”\n\nATF nominee\n\nSeveral groups have praised the President’s appointment of Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If confirmed by the Senate, Dettelbach would be the nation’s top gun regulator.\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the day after the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Dettelbach vowed to lawmakers that he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/61075086', 'Headline': ""Biden sets rule banning sale of untraceable DIY 'ghost gun' kits - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'US President Joe Biden\'s administration has finalised a set of new regulations targeting untraceable ""ghost guns"".

In 2020, a record of about 22m guns were legally sold. Almost 19m guns were bought in 2021.\n\nAlso on Monday, Mr Biden announced a new nominee for the ATF after his first choice failed to advance through the Senate confirmation process because of Republican opposition.\n\nIf confirmed, former US attorney for Ohio Steve Dettlebach will be the first to hold the office since 2013.\n\nA bullseye for Biden or a misfire?\n\nGun control is an issue Democrats in Washington always talk about but seldom are able to do much about. Part of this is the reality of congressional gridlock, which allows Republicans in the US Senate to block any substantive legislation on the topic. There is also a fear among Democrats that guns are an electoral liability. They worry that firearm-rights activists are more likely to punish them for new legislation than gun-control proponents are to reward them.\n\nAnd so Democratic-backed changes, at least on the national level, are made on the margins. Such is the case with the administration move to regulate ghost guns, which at the moment play a relatively small part in the rise of US gun violence.\n\nIt is an area, however, where the Biden administration can act on its own, without congressional support. The president can tout an accomplishment that may placate supporters concerned that gun control has languished on the back-burner during the first half of his presidency.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'Since 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals.', 'Full_text': 'In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Attorney General to move as close to universal background checks as possible within existing law. Today, as a result of the Executive Order and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\nWhy the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action\n\nSince 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the background check requirement.\n\nLast year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nNew Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands\n\nToday, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again, you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that you need a license.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nOffer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell them additional firearms;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were purchased;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their original packaging;\n\nRepetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and model; or\n\nAs a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called “fire sale loophole.”\n\nThe proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to “predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such as:\n\nCreating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a firearms business;\n\nMaintaining records to document and track profits and losses from firearms purchases or sales; or\n\nPurchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.\n\nThe proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole” or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nThe proposed rule is now open for public comment. The Department of Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final rule.\n\nContinuing to Call on Congress to Act\n\nThis rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.\n\nHowever, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.\n\n###'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/02/us/biden-gun-control-speech', 'Headline': ""Biden's Guns Speech: Biden Calls for Ban on Assault Weapons and New ..."", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — President Biden demanded on Thursday that lawmakers respond to communities turned into “killing fields” by passing far-reaching limits on guns, calling on Congress to ban assault-style weapons, expand background checks and pass “red flag” laws after massacres in Texas and New York.', 'Full_text': '“My God,” he declared from the Cross Hall, a ceremonial part of the White House residence, which was lined with candles in honor of victims of gun violence. “The fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals, even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable. We can’t fail the American people again.”\n\nMr. Biden’s speech came a day after a mass shooting in Tulsa, Okla., that killed four victims and nine days after a massacre in Uvalde, Texas, that took the lives of 19 elementary school children and two teachers. Ten days before that, 10 Black people were gunned down in a grocery store in Buffalo. The list, Mr. Biden said, goes on.\n\n“After Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland — nothing has been done,” he said, lamenting decades of inaction.\n\nWith the 17-minute address, Mr. Biden abruptly shed the reluctance of his White House to engage in what could become yet another fruitless partisan confrontation, played out amid funerals in Uvalde, Buffalo and Tulsa. After weeks of carefully calibrating his calls for action, the president on Thursday did not hold back.\n\n“Enough, enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part,” he told Americans. “For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love.”\n\n“Let’s hear the call and the cry,” he said, almost pleading with his fellow politicians in Washington. “Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.”\n\nWhether that will happen remains unclear. Despite his forceful tone, Mr. Biden all but acknowledged in his speech the political realities that could make him just another in a long line of presidents to have demanded action on guns, only to fail. He called the fight “hard,” and moments after urging a ban on assault weapons, he offered alternatives if that proved to be impossible.\n\n“If we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21, strengthen the background checks,” he said. He called on Congress to “enact safe storage law and red flag laws, repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability, address the mental health crisis.”\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Biden turned his evident cynicism about Republicans into a kind of political threat, saying that “if Congress fails, I believe this time a majority of the American people won’t give up either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote.”\n\nMr. Biden is not a newcomer to the gun debate.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he favors reinstating the ban on assault weapons that he helped pass as a senator and was law for a decade before it expired in 2004. He has called on lawmakers to pass universal background checks for a decade, since 20 children were killed in a shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.\n\nBut both of those measures are seen as highly unlikely to pass in Congress, where fierce Republican opposition has historically stood in their way. Lawmakers in both parties have said recently that they do not believe there is enough bipartisan support to approve either approach.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday advanced a wide-ranging package of gun control legislation that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people under 21 and ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. But those measures, too, were all but certain to die in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats put forward the legislation in response to the killings in Uvalde and the racist massacre in Buffalo — both, the police say, at the hands of 18-year-old gunmen using legally purchased AR-15-style weapons.\n\nA bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee spent Thursday considering the legislation and approved it Thursday evening, on a party-line vote of 25 to 19. Fierce Republican opposition during the committee debate underscored the partisan animosity.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned that another shooting was not far away. He pleaded with Republicans, “My friends, what the hell are you waiting for?”\n\nRepublicans deride such measures as unconstitutional attempts to take guns from law-abiding Americans, robbing them of their right to defend themselves. Representative Dan Bishop, Republican of North Carolina, expressed outrage that Democrats had painted Republicans as complicit in mass shootings, declaring, “You are not going to bully your way into stripping Americans of fundamental rights.”\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said administration officials had been in close touch with lawmakers over the past several days as a bipartisan group of senators discussed a narrower set of limits on gun ownership.\n\nThe negotiations have centered on expanding background checks and providing incentives for states to pass red flag laws, which allow guns to be seized from dangerous people. The group is also looking at proposals on the safe storage of guns at home, community violence and mental health, according to aides and senators involved in the talks.\n\nWith Republicans unanimously opposed to most major gun control measures, the Senate talks offer what is probably the best chance at finding a bipartisan compromise on guns that could pass the 50-to-50 Senate, where 60 votes are needed to break a filibuster and bring legislation to a vote.\n\nBut the endeavor faces long odds, with little evidence that either side is willing to give ground on a debate that has been stalled for years.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut is leading the talks for Democrats, joined by his fellow party members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The Republican senators they are huddling with include Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThose nine negotiators met over Zoom on Wednesday to discuss their progress, convening for an hour after days of individual phone calls and smaller meetings with each other and their colleagues. Talks were expected to continue before the Senate returns early next week.\n\n“We are making rapid progress toward a common-sense package that could garner support from both Republicans and Democrats,” Ms. Collins said in a brief statement after the meeting.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, a top ally to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also been involved in discussions, including a Tuesday meeting with Mr. Murphy, Ms. Sinema and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina.\n\nDemocratic leaders have warned that if an agreement cannot be reached quickly, they will force votes on the bills in the House, which do not have Republican support, to demonstrate for Americans which lawmakers are standing in the way of passing gun safety measures.\n\n“I’m cleareyed about the history of failure,” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting. “But if there’s ever a moment to put up or shut up, this one is it.”\n\nIn the days immediately after the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings, both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris largely stayed away from any direct negotiations with lawmakers about how to create a response to the shootings that can pass in Congress.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Biden abandoned that approach, deciding instead to lay down a marker that will cement his legacy as a president who fought for tougher gun laws, successful or not.\n\nIn his speech on Thursday, Mr. Biden described the deep grief that he experienced when he and his wife talked to the families of victims in the two mass shootings.\n\n“At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members, who were broken, whose lives will never be the same,” he said. “They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.”\n\n“How much more carnage are we willing to accept?” he asked. “How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say: Enough. Enough.”\n\nAnd he made the target of his comment clear, saying it now falls to Congress to pass the far-reaching laws it has refused to in the past.\n\n“The question now is: What will the Congress do?” he said. The president said he supported the efforts by the bipartisan group in the Senate to find a compromise, but called it the least lawmakers should do.\n\nThe approach Thursday night was more like the response from former President Barack Obama in January 2013, just weeks after the shooting at the school in Newtown.\n\nMr. Obama, flanked by Mr. Biden, who was then the vice president, proposed a package of gun control measures, including: ensuring that all gun owners go through a background check; improving state reporting of criminals and the mentally ill; banning assault weapons; and capping magazine clip capacity at 10 bullets.\n\nIn the face of Republican opposition, Mr. Obama dropped his demand for an assault weapon ban and limits on the size of magazine clips. After months of pushing by Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, the Senate rejected a bipartisan effort to expand background checks.\n\nIn scathing comments after the bill died, Mr. Obama derided senators for deciding that the lives of children were not worth the effort to pass legislation. A decade later, Mr. Obama’s grim assessment stands as a warning for Mr. Biden of what might happen again.\n\n“All in all,” Mr. Obama said at the time, “this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.”\n\nEmily Cochrane , Catie Edmondson and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nThe day before, we visited Uvalde — Uvalde, Texas. In front of Robb Elementary School, we stood before 21 crosses, for 19 third and fourth graders and two teachers. On each cross, a name.\n\nAnd nearby, a photo of each victim, that Jill and I reached out to touch. Innocent victims, murdered in a classroom that had been turned into a killing field. Standing there in that small town, like so many other communities across America, I couldn’t help but think there are too many other schools, too many other everyday places that have become killing fields, battlefields, here in America.\n\nWe stood in such a place just 12 days before, across from a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, memorializing 10 fellow Americans — a spouse, a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, gone forever. At both places, we spent hours with hundreds of family members who were broken, and whose lives will never be the same. They had one message for all of us: Do something. Just do something. For God’s sake, do something.\n\nAfter Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland, nothing has been done. This time, that can’t be true. This time, we must actually do something. The issue we face is one of conscience and common sense.\n\nFor so many of you at home, I want to be very clear. This is not about taking away anyone’s guns. It’s not about vilifying gun owners. In fact, we believe we should be treating responsible gun owners as an example of how every gun owner should behave.\n\nI respect the culture and the tradition and the concerns of lawful gun owners. At the same time, the Second Amendment, like all other rights, is not absolute. It was Justice Scalia who wrote, and I quote: “Like most rights, the right Second Amendment — the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited.” Not unlimited. It never has been.\n\nThere have always been limitations on what weapons you can own in America. For example, machine guns have been federally regulated for nearly 90 years, and this is still a free country. This isn’t about taking away anyone’s rights. It’s about protecting children. It’s about protecting families. It’s about protecting whole communities. It’s about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to a church, without being shot and killed.\n\nAccording to new data just released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guns are the No. 1 killer of children in the United States of America. The No. 1 killer. More than car accidents, more than cancer. Over the last two decades, more school-age children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined.\n\nThink about that. More kids than on-duty cops killed by guns. More kids than soldiers killed by guns. For God’s sake. How much more carnage are we willing to accept? How many more innocent American lives must be taken before we say enough? Enough.\n\nI know that we can’t prevent every tragedy, but here’s what I believe we have to do. Here’s what the overwhelming majority of the American people believe we must do. Here’s what the families in Buffalo and Uvalde, in Texas, told us we must do.\n\nWe need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. And if we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21. Strengthen the background checks, enact safe storage laws and “red flag” laws. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. Address the mental health crisis deepening the trauma of gun violence, and as a consequence of that violence.\n\nThese are rational, common-sense measures. Here’s what it all means. It all means this: We should reinstate the assault weapons ban on high capacity magazines that we passed in 1994 with bipartisan support in Congress and the support of law enforcement.\n\nNine categories of semiautomatic weapons were included in that ban, like AK-47s and AR-15s. And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down. But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.\n\nA few years ago, the family of the inventor of the AR-15 said he would have been horrified to know his design was being used to slaughter children and other innocent lives instead of being used as a military weapon on the battlefields, as it was designed. That’s what it was designed for.\n\nEnough, enough. We should limit how many rounds a weapon can hold. Why in God’s name should an ordinary citizen be able to purchase an assault weapon that holds 30-round magazines that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes? The damage was so devastating in Uvalde parents had to do DNA swabs to identify the remains of their children. Nine- and 10-year-old children.\n\nEnough. We should expand background checks to keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitives and those under restraining orders. Stronger background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, agree on.\n\nI also believe we should have safe storage laws, and personal liability for not locking up your gun. The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns. They were too easy to access. That’s how he got the weapons. The weapon he used to kill his mother, and then murder 26 people, including 20 first graders.\n\nIf you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it. Every responsible gun owner agrees. To make sure no one else can have access to it. To lock it up. To have trigger locks. And if you don’t, and something bad happens, you should be held responsible.\n\nWe should also have national red flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates or experiencing suicidal thoughts — it makes them a danger to themselves or to others. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws. The Delaware law is named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\nFort Hood, Texas, 2009. Thirteen dead and more than 30 injured. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., 2018. Seventeen dead, 17 injured. In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds. Red flag laws could have stopped both these shooters.\n\nIn Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused. But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon, even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21.\n\nIf we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21. Look, I know some folks will say 18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons, but that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.\n\nWe should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons. They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.\n\nImagine. Imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued, where we’d be today. The gun industry’s special protections are outrageous. It must end.\n\nAnd let there be no mistake about the psychological trauma that gun violence leaves behind. Imagine being that little girl, that brave little girl in Uvalde, who smeared blood off her murdered friend’s body onto her own face, to lie still among the corpses in her classroom and pretend she was dead in order to stay alive. Imagine. Imagine what it would be like for her to walk down the hallway of any school again.\n\nImagine what it’s like for children who experience this kind of trauma every day in school, on the streets, in communities all across America. Imagine what it’s like for so many parents to hug their children goodbye in the morning, not sure whether they’ll come back home. Unfortunately, too many people don’t have to imagine that at all.\n\nEven before the pandemic, young people were already hurting. There’s a serious youth mental health crisis in this country. We have to do something about it. That’s why mental health is the heart of my unity agenda that I laid out in the State of the Union address this year.\n\nWe must provide more school counselors; more school nurses; more mental health services for students and for teachers. More people volunteering as mentors to help young people succeed. More privacy protection and resources to keep kids safe from the harms of social media.\n\nThis unity agenda won’t fully heal the wounded souls, but it will help. It matters.\n\nI just told you what I’d do. The question now is: What will the congress do?\n\nThe House of Representatives already passed key measures we need: Expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun sales, including at gun shows and online sales. Getting rid of a loophole that allows a gun sale to go through after three business days, even if the background check has not been completed.\n\nAnd the House is planning even more action next week. Safe storage requirements. The banning of high-capacity magazines. Raising the age to buy an assault weapon to 21. Federal red flag law. Codifying my ban on ghost guns that don’t have serial numbers and can’t be traced. And tougher laws to prevent gun trafficking and straw purchases.\n\nThis time, we have to take the time to do something. And this time, it’s time for the Senate to do something.\n\nBut, as we know, in order to get anything done in the Senate, we need a minimum of 10 Republican senators. I support the bipartisan efforts that include a small group of Democrats and Republican senators trying to find a way. But my God. The fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable.\n\nWe can’t fail the American people again. Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday, at a hospital in Tulsa, Okla. A shooter deliberately targeted a surgeon using an assault weapon he bought just a few hours before his rampage that left a surgeon, another doctor, a receptionist and a patient dead, and many more injured. That doesn’t count the carnage we see every single day that doesn’t make the headlines.\n\nI’ve been in this fight for a long time. I know how hard it is, but I’ll never give up. And if Congress fails, I believe this time, a majority of the American people won’t give up, either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote. Enough, enough, enough.\n\nOver the next 17 days, the families in Uvalde will continue burying their dead. It will take that long, in part, because it’s a town where everyone knows everyone, and day by day they will honor each one they lost. Jill and I met with the owner and staff of the funeral home, who was being strong, strong, strong to take care of their own. And the people of Uvalde mourned, as they do over the next 17 days. What will we be doing as a nation?\n\nJill and I met with the sister of the teacher who was murdered and whose husband died of a heart attack two days later, leaving behind four beautiful, orphaned children. All now orphans.\n\nThe sister asked us: What could she say? What could she tell her nieces and nephews? The most heartbreaking moments that I can remember. All I could think to say was, I told her to hold them tight. Hold them tight.\n\nAfter visiting the school, we attended Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church with Father Eddy. In the pews, family and friends held each other tightly. As Archbishop Gustavo spoke, he asked the children in attendance to come up on the altar and sit in the altar with him, as he spoke. There wasn’t enough room, so a mom and her young son sat next to Jill and me in the first pew.\n\nAnd as we left the church, a grandmother who had just lost her granddaughter passed me a handwritten letter. It read, quote: “Erase the invisible line that is dividing our nation. Come up with a solution and fix what’s broken and make the changes that are necessary to prevent this happening again.” End of quote.\n\nMy fellow Americans, enough. Enough. It’s time for each of us to do our part. It’s time to act. For the children we’ve lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love. Let’s hear the call and the cry. Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.\n\nGod bless the families who are hurting. God bless you all. From a hymn based in the 91st Psalm, sung in my church: “May he raise you up on eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn. Make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand.”\n\nThat’s my prayer for all of you. God bless you.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-landmark-gun-legislation-god-willing-s-going-lot-lives-rcna35326', 'Headline': ""Biden signs landmark gun legislation: 'God willing, it's going to save ..."", 'Snippet': 'The bill provides grants to states for “red flag” laws, enhances background checks to include juvenile records, and closes the “boyfriend loophole” by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.', 'Full_text': 'President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of meetings with world leaders.\n\nBiden called the signing of the legislation a ""monumental day"" and said it was proof that Democrats and Republicans could find common ground on important issues.\n\n“God willing, it\'s going to save a lot of lives,"" he said.\n\nThe bill provides grants to states for “red flag” laws, enhances background checks to include juvenile records, and closes the “boyfriend loophole” by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.

""If we can reach a compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans health care to cutting-edge American innovation to so much more.""\n\nHe had pleaded with lawmakers to pass legislation tightening gun laws following the shootings in Buffalo, New York, and in Uvalde. But the bill stopped short of his call for Congress to ban assault weapons and to require background checks for all gun purchases, both of which are widely opposed by Republicans in Congress.\n\n“I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day,” Biden said. “God bless us with the strength to get the work left done.”\n\nThe bill gives Biden a win following two major blows from the Supreme Court over the past week. The court ruled Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating a woman\'s constitutional right to an abortion. And on Thursday, it struck down a New York law that required showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.\n\n“I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions,” Biden said when asked about those rulings by a reporter.\n\nBiden signed the gun legislation moments before heading to Europe for a week of meetings with Group of Seven leaders in Germany and with NATO leaders in Spain. When he returns, he said, he plans to have an event at the White House with the lawmakers who helped pass the bill.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-administration-proposes-eliminating-gun-show-loophole-regulation-rcna102800', 'Headline': ""Biden administration proposes regulation to eliminate 'gun show loophole'"", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms in years.', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms in years.\n\nThe administration said that new language in a law passed last year by Congress after the Uvalde school shooting is empowering it to take the action, though Second Amendment activists are likely to challenge the move in court.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is proposing a regulation that would essentially say that anyone who deals in firearms for profit must get a federal license — and conduct criminal background checks — regardless of whether they sell the guns in brick-and-mortar stores, gun shows, flea markets or on the internet. The new rule will go through the federal rulemaking process.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday that the move is a result of the bipartisan law passed by Congress last year.\n\n“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was passed by Congress to reduce gun violence, including by expanding the background checks that keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” he said. “This proposed rule implements Congress’s mandate to expand the definition of who must obtain a license and conduct a background check before selling firearms.”\n\nThe ""gun show loophole"" has been cited for years as a major hole in the federal background check system, allowing a vast number of private sales without background checks. The ATF currently licenses about 80,000 brick-and-mortar gun dealers, but gun sales are increasingly taking place outside that system, free of background checks.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signed an executive order designed to expand background checks. It directed Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of selling firearms, an authority an administration official said was detailed in the bipartisan gun law.\n\nNBC News reported last year about some of the provisions of the law that led to Thursday\'s proposed rule. At the time, however, sources close to the negotiations behind the legislation tempered expectations that it could close the gun show loophole or have a significant effect on the sale of guns online, although they hoped it would bolster enforcement and oversight of the firearms market.\n\nThe sources said they had in mind the shooter in Midland-Odessa, Texas, who killed eight people in 2019 with a gun that he bought through a private sale. He had previously failed a background check from a licensed gun seller and was not allowed to buy a weapon.\n\nBiden touted the bipartisan legislation in June, a year after he signed it into law, saying that it was already saving lives.\n\nThe president said the law has allowed the Justice Department to run enhanced background checks through the FBI on adults under 21 who try to buy firearms. It has also provided funding to states to expand the so-called red flag laws that allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. And it has provided money to states to boost mental health services, especially for young people. Biden also noted that the law closed the so-called boyfriend loophole by keeping guns away from unmarried dating partners convicted of abuse.\n\nBiden has long made it a priority to enact policies focused on curbing gun violence. He and then-President Barack Obama attempted to push Congress to pass such measures, and the closest it came was in 2013, a few months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The Senate fell six votes short of advancing a bill by Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would have required background checks in all commercial gun sales.\n\nSince becoming president, while still pressuring Congress to pass legislation, Biden has also used his executive authority to try to reduce gun violence, although he faces limits. He has repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass another assault weapons ban in the wake of several mass shootings.\n\nThere\'s little chance of such a measure passing through both chambers of Congress. Republicans narrowly control the House, and Democrats have a thin majority in the Senate, meaning they would need substantial Republican support to overcome a filibuster.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-cracks-down-on-ghost-guns-ensures-that-atf-has-the-leadership-it-needs-to-enforce-our-gun-laws/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Cracks Down on Ghost Guns, Ensures ...', 'Snippet': 'President Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget calls on Congress to deliver the funding needed to implement the President’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make our communities safer.', 'Full_text': 'Today, President Biden and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco will deliver remarks in the Rose Garden to announce additional steps the Administration is taking to combat gun crime.\n\nEnsuring that ATF has the leadership it needs to enforce our commonsense gun laws and fight gun crime.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is our top federal law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing our commonsense gun laws. Today, the President is nominating Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of ATF.\n\nDettelbach is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney and career prosecutor who spent over two decades as a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. He has received bipartisan praise and support from law enforcement for his work. In 2009, he was unanimously confirmed for his position as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. He has a proven track record of working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to fight violent crime and combat domestic violent extremism and religious violence – including through partnerships with the ATF to prosecute complex cases and take down violent criminal gangs. Dettelbach also worked closely with local law enforcement and community leaders to develop and implement data-driven and neighborhood-based efforts to prevent and fight violent crime. His leadership and his record of innovation in fighting crime and violence make him ready from day one to aggressively and creatively address these pressing issues at the Director of ATF.\n\nCracking down on ghost guns – the weapon of choice for many violent criminals\n\nToday, the President and Deputy Attorney General will also announce that the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a final rule to rein in the proliferation of “ghost guns” – unserialized, privately-made firearms that law enforcement are increasingly recovering at crime scenes in cities across the country. Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to ATF as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a ten-fold increase from 2016.[1] Because ghost guns lack the serial numbers marked on other firearms, law enforcement has an exceedingly difficult time tracing a ghost gun found at a crime scene back to an individual purchaser.\n\nThis final rule bans the business of manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns, such as unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that individuals can buy online or at a store without a background check and can readily assemble into a working firearm in as little as 30 minutes with equipment they have at home. This rule clarifies that these kits qualify as “firearms” under the Gun Control Act, and that commercial manufacturers of such kits must therefore become licensed and include serial numbers on the kits’ frame or receiver, and commercial sellers of these kits must become federally licensed and run background checks prior to a sale – just like they have to do with other commercially-made firearms.\n\nThe final rule will also help turn some ghost guns already in circulation into serialized firearms. Through this rule, the Justice Department is requiring federally licensed dealers and gunsmiths taking any unserialized firearm into inventory to serialize that weapon. For example, if an individual builds a firearm at home and then sells it to a pawn broker or another federally licensed dealer, that dealer must put a serial number on the weapon before selling it to a customer. This requirement will apply regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts, kits, or by 3D-printers.\n\nThis rule builds on the Biden Administration’s prior executive action to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative, which is training a national cadre of prosecutors and disseminating investigation and prosecution tool to help bring cases against those who use ghost guns to commit crimes. As President Biden said during an event at the New York Police Department headquarters, if you use a ghost gun to commit a crime “not only are state and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect federal charges and federal prosecution as well.”\n\nAdditional executive action to reduce gun violence\n\nToday’s final rule includes two additional actions to make our communities safer.\n\nFirst, the final rule ensures that firearms with split receivers are subject to regulations requiring serial numbers and background checks when purchased from a licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer. Decades ago, ATF issued a regulation defining the “frame or receiver” of a firearm as the part that is regulated by the Gun Control Act – meaning that is the part that triggers federal serialization, background check, and other requirements. At that time, many firearms in the United States were single-framed firearms, like revolvers, that house key components in a single structure. However, we have seen the increasing popularity of firearms using split or multi-part receivers that house key components in multiple structures. Some courts have recently interpreted decades-old regulatory text in a way that, if broadly applied, could mean that as many as 90 percent of firearms in the United States today would not have a frame or receiver subject to federal regulation. The final rule updates the regulatory definitions of “frame” and “receiver” to ensure that firearms using split or multi-part receivers continue to be covered by our common-sense gun laws.\n\nSecond, the final rule requires federally licensed firearms dealers to retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity. At that time, these dealers must transfer the records to ATF, just as they are currently required to do at the end of licensed activity. Previously, these dealers were permitted to destroy most records after 20 years, making it harder for law enforcement to trace firearms found at crime scenes. According to ATF’s National Tracing Center, on average more than 1,300 firearms a year are untraceable because the federally licensed firearms dealer destroyed the relevant records that were more than 20 years old.\n\nImplementing the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy\n\nThis final rule is part of the President’s comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy. President Biden made more progress on executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other President during their first year in office. You can read more about the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to reduce gun crime here.\n\nPresident Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget calls on Congress to deliver the funding needed to implement the President’s comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make our communities safer. These additional resources will fund accountable policing, including by putting more police officers on the beat, and making essential investments in crime prevention and community violence intervention.\n\nCongress needs to do its job by passing this budget and other essential legislation to reduce gun crime, including legislation to require background checks for all gun sales, ensure that no terrorist can buy a weapon in the United States, ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms — ghost guns, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repeal gun manufacturers’ protection from liability.\n\n###'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/joe-biden-guns-crime/', 'Headline': 'Where Joe Biden stands on crime and guns - Washington Post', 'Snippet': 'Joe Biden supports restricting access to guns for people who may harm themselves or others, and he supports requiring expanded background checks.

There, the President reiterated his view that Xi is a “dictator,” after being asked by a reporter whether he stood by a comment saying as much this past June.\n\nAt that point, Beijing reacted with vitriol, with the remark seen as casting a shadow over tentative progress in advancing dialogue between the two sides following a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s latest comment at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday, a spokesperson called it “extremely erroneous” and an “irresponsible political maneuver, which China firmly opposes.”\n\n“What needs to be pointed out is that there will always be some people with ulterior motives attempting to undermine China-US relations. They will not succeed in doing so,” spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether there will be any further reaction this time, but the response comes as China’s signaling around the San Francisco Bay Area meeting between Xi and Biden has marked a shift away from its hardline position on the United States. This softening comes as China grapples with a troubled economy and is keen to highlight Xi as a powerful and capable world leader.\n\nAccording to statements from both the US and China Wednesday, the two sides agreed to restore military communications and to combat the flow of fentanyl from China to the US during several hours of “constructive” meetings.\n\nChina labeled the talks as “positive” and “comprehensive” — while also highlighting Xi’s efforts to spell out Beijing’s non-negotiables such as its position on Taiwan and perceived American efforts to contain China’s rise.\n\nXi’s optics\n\nOn Chinese state media and across social media platforms, where the hashtag #Planet-Earth-Is-Big-Enough-For-Both-China-And-The-US was trending, the broad perception appeared to be of a job well done.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV highlighted how Biden invited Xi for a walk around the leafy estate where the meeting took place and that the American leader “personally escorted him to his car to bid goodbye” — a detail that was also highlighted in another top-trending hashtag on Chinese social media.\n\nThe positive coverage of the event was a break from the typical rhetoric critical of the US that often plays across Chinese state and social media. Anti-US rhetoric has been a significant theme boosting growth in Chinese nationalism as tensions flared between the two in recent years.\n\nThe optics of a warm welcome and the display of a commanding presence next to Biden are critically important for Xi, who analysts say was not only keen to stabilize a complicated relationship at a time of economic weakness, but also to present himself to his domestic audience as skillfully helming China’s foreign affairs.\n\nXi’s visit came as the Chinese economy struggles with a property market crisis, high local government debt and record youth unemployment. At the same time, crackdowns across several sectors have pummeled business confidence and led many to question what opportunities remained in China.\n\n“These challenges are tremendous,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, who noted that in California, Xi wanted to show viewers back home his “leadership capacity in the foreign affairs arena” and that he is highly regarded in America and a world leader on par with Biden.\n\nA press conference with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in California following the bilateral meeting also underscored some of those optics.\n\nWang noted that Biden sent a “separate invitation to President Xi Jinping specifically to hold a heads of state meeting,” unlike other bilateral meeting arrangements happening during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum that Xi and other leaders from across the Pacific are in town to attend.\n\n“(The Xi-Biden meeting) is sure to become a milestone … and a major event in today’s international relations,” Wang said, pointing out that the four-hour face-to-face talks were held “amidst the backdrop of a critical stage in China-US relations.”\n\nXi also took a conciliatory tone speaking at a dinner event in front of American CEOs later that day.\n\nHe told the audience the most fundamental question shaping US-China relations is whether they are rivals or partners.\n\n“If we regard each other as the biggest rival, the most significant geopolitical challenge and an ever-pressing threat, it will inevitably lead to wrong policies, wrong actions and wrong results,” Xi told an audience that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n“China is willing to be a partner and friend of the United States,” he added.\n\n‘Bottom lines’\n\nWhile it helped to advance dialogue and cooperation, the meeting was also a chance for both sides to highlight their differences — and showed areas where they did not reach consensus, which analysts say will continue to define their contentious relationship.\n\nAnd even within areas where they two sides did come to agreement, there remains fragile ground.\n\nChina’s announcement of the restoration of military communications, which the Biden administration had long pushed for, said those would resume “on the basis of equality and respect.”\n\n“What that means is in the future anytime China is annoyed with anything the US does, China can say it’s cutting off military-to-military dialogues again and blame it on the US (for) no longer making China feel ‘respected,’” said Wen-Ti Sung, a Taiwan-based fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\n\n“(This) undermines the basis of the talks’ resumption and existence,” he added.\n\nOn Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that China’s ruling Communist Party claims, Xi urged the US to stop arming the island and to support China’s “peaceful reunification,” according to China’s readout of the meeting released by state media.\n\n“China will eventually achieve reunification, and will inevitably achieve reunification,” Xi was quoted as saying — another line that was also trending on Chinese social media following the meeting.\n\nBiden, for his part, reaffirmed the long-standing American position on Taiwan and its opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo, saying cross-strait differences must be “resolved by peaceful means,” according to a readout from the White House.\n\nXi also called on the US to “not scheme to suppress or contain China,” in an apparent reference to America’s strengthening of its alliances in Asia and what Beijing sees as efforts to stymie its economic development with trade and investment restrictions on high tech. Washington says those curbs are intended to protect its national security against an assertive and authoritarian China.\n\n“Both sides should understand each other’s principles and bottom lines,” Xi added.\n\nThe deep concerns each has about the other’s intentions are unlikely to be soothed after one meeting. How those agreements are executed in the weeks and months to come say much about whether China and the US are both committed to lasting stability.\n\n“The meeting indicates that the US-China relationship is not going to further worsen in the next year, but will it rebound very quickly and become significantly warmer very soon? I would say no,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at City University of Hong Kong.\n\n“Of course, Xi Jinping wants better US-China relations, but (Beijing) realizes … the fundamental fact (is) that the US wants to contain China, so their expectation is that warmer relations are good, but as long as they don’t get worse, they can accept that,” he said.\n\nOne immediate indicator of how relations will progress may be seen in any further response from Beijing to Biden’s “dictator” comment, and whether its state media and social media platforms continue gloss over the comment to focus on the positive outcomes from Wednesday.\n\nBiden himself seems to indicate hope that the two can work through their differences as he noted that “(Xi) is a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is communist” and that the Chinese government “is totally different than ours.”\n\n“Anyway,” he added. “We made progress.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/21/politics/biden-xi-china-dictators-fundraiser/index.html', 'Headline': 'Fierce backlash in Beijing to Biden likening Xi to a dictator ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'When President Joe Biden referred to his Chinese counterpart as a dictator late Tuesday in California, the response from Beijing was swift and angry. “The remarks seriously contradict basic ...', 'Full_text': 'When President Joe Biden referred to his Chinese counterpart as a dictator late Tuesday in California, the response from Beijing was swift and angry.\n\n“The remarks seriously contradict basic facts, seriously violate diplomatic etiquette, and seriously infringe on China’s political dignity,” the spokesperson for the foreign ministry said.\n\nWhether the new acrimony further derails a “thaw” in US-China ties, something that Biden has openly hoped for, remained an open question.\n\nOfficials at the White House made no attempt to clarify Biden’s remark. And while some US officials expressed surprise after reading the president’s quotes, there was little to indicate he misspoke while detailing his view of the spy balloon incident earlier this year that temporarily caused a pause in US-China relations.\n\n“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is he didn’t know it was there,” Biden told Democratic donors underneath a white tent in a backyard in Marin County. “No, I’m serious. That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn’t know what happened.”\n\nBiden’s assessment that President Xi Jinping had been in the dark about the balloon accurately reflects US intelligence about the episode, one person familiar with the matter said. But revealing that information in public – as Biden has done twice now over the past few days – caught some officials off guard since it had previously only been the private assessment of the situation.\n\n“He didn’t know about it,” Biden told donors. “When it got shot down he was very embarrassed and he denied it was even there.”\n\nAnother senior administration official said Biden’s candor on China was hardly shocking.\n\n“It should come as no surprise that the president speaks candidly about China and the differences that we have – we are certainly not alone in that,” the senior administration official said.\n\nPerhaps more surprising than the content of Biden’s remarks, however, was their timing. Biden was speaking at a fragile moment for US-China ties, days after a high-profile diplomatic visit to Beijing by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to yield a pause in the enmity. Describing Xi as “very embarrassed” and out of touch may act counter to those efforts.\n\nDuring his visit, Blinken met for just over half-an-hour with Xi in what was later described as a “constructive” conversation.\n\nBlinken hasn’t yet returned to Washington to brief Biden in-person on his visit, though White House officials said that was planned as soon as he’s back. Washington’s top diplomat said Monday that the US and China had made “progress” toward bringing relations back on track with both sides agreeing on the need to “stabilize” their bilateral relationship.\n\nThe senior administration official expressed confidence Biden’s comments would not upend US diplomatic efforts with China, asserting “every expectation of building on” the progress Blinken made during his recent visit to Beijing.\n\n“The president believes that diplomacy, including that undertaken by Secretary Blinken, is the responsible way to manage tensions. Secretary Blinken had a good trip and made some progress. We have every expectation of building on that progress,” the official said.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks Tuesday, Biden praised Blinken’s work to repair the relationship by reiterating he “did a good job” and adding that improving the relationship would “take time.” At a second fundraiser Tuesday, Biden told donors that US climate envoy John Kerry would also hopefully be making a trip to China “pretty soon” with a focus on the environment.\n\nBiden himself told reporters over the weekend he hoped to meet Xi in the coming months, believing high-level engagement is the only way to prevent the relationship from spiraling into conflict. After his comment, some officials said it was too soon to say whether the fundraiser remarks would cause another breakdown in relations.\n\n“That’s up to China,” one official said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was too early to speculate whether such a meeting could occur on the sidelines of this year’s Group of 20 summit in India, scheduled for September. Biden and Xi last met at a G20 conference in Bali.\n\nThe two presidents could also arrange a meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit Biden is hosting in November in San Francisco. Xi last visited the United States in 2017 for talks with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he didn’t have any time or dates for a Biden-Xi meeting: “I don’t have anything to speak to with respect to the next discussion slash meeting with President Xi,” he said.\n\nCiting Biden’s comments about a potential meeting in the coming months, Kirby said, “That will happen and it’ll happen at the appropriate time.”\n\n“Whether it happens at the G20 this year or not, I simply don’t know and wouldn’t speak to this early on,” he went on.\n\nBiden details tension with China\n\nThe president on Tuesday went into additional detail on some of the ongoing tension between the two superpowers. He said that while China’s leader was “embarrassed” about the balloon incident, what “he was really upset about” was Biden’s efforts since taking office to bring the leaders of the Quad – the United States, India, Australia and Japan – closer together to serve as a counterweight to a more assertive China.\n\n“He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,” Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. “We’re just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.”\n\nAt least in the near term, Biden’s remark prompted China’s friends to demonstrate their allegiances.\n\n“These are very contradictory manifestations of US foreign policy, which, on the one hand, reflect its unpredictability, [and] on the other hand, a continuation of the US mentoring policy,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his regular press briefing.\n\nPeskov said that Russia has “its own very bad relations” with the US, while it had “very good relations” with China.\n\nBiden’s comments Tuesday likening Xi to “dictators” marked the latest example of a president who often speaks more freely when cameras are off at fundraisers, including offering more candid musings about other world leaders and foreign affairs.\n\nThe president issued a chilling warning to Democratic donors in New York City last year when he mused about the threat of nuclear “Armageddon” amid concerns Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats - comments that went beyond how other US officials had spoken about the matter.\n\nIn another fundraiser last fall, the president used Italy’s election of a far right leader to warn Democrats not to be “sanguine about what’s happening here” heading into the midterm elections.\n\n“You just saw what’s happened in Italy in that election,” Biden told the donors and Democratic officials at a Washington, DC, fundraiser. “You’re seeing what’s happening around the world. And the reason I bother to say that is we can’t be sanguine about what’s happening here either. I don’t want to exaggerate it, but I don’t want to understate it.”\n\nAnd on at least one occasion, he disclosed details of a private conversation with a world leader during a fundraiser, revealing that French President Emmanuel Macron was the leader who asked him how long America is “back” for at a G7 summit on the Cornish coast in England.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/07/25/international-opinion-of-joe-biden-in-6-charts/', 'Headline': 'International opinion of Joe Biden in 6 charts - Pew Research Center', 'Snippet': 'A median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.

In the Asia ...', 'Full_text': 'For over 20 years, Pew Research Center has tracked international public opinion of world leaders, including the U.S. president. In his second year in office, Joe Biden receives generally positive ratings in the countries surveyed by the Center. In most of these places, Biden’s ratings are higher than those of his predecessor in the White House, Donald Trump, but lower than his own ratings in 2021.\n\nHere are six charts on what people in surveyed countries think of Biden, based on polls conducted in each nation in the spring of 2022.\n\nA median of 58% of adults across 18 countries say they have confidence in Joe Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nConfidence in Biden varies widely by region and country. In Europe alone, the share of adults who offer a positive rating of Biden ranges from 82% in Poland to just under a third (31%) in Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea and Japan stand out with 70% and 62% of adults, respectively, saying they have confidence in the U.S. president. Opinion is more divided in Malaysia, Australia and Singapore.\n\nIn Israel, six-in-ten adults say they have confidence in Biden, though fewer than half attach positive descriptors to him like “strong leader” (41% say this about him), “caring about ordinary people” (36%) and “charismatic” (27%).\n\nConfidence in Biden has dropped significantly in most places surveyed in 2021 and 2022. The share of adults who have confidence in Biden on the world stage has decreased by double digits in 13 of the 14 countries surveyed in both years. In Italy, Greece, Spain and Singapore, half or more now have little or no confidence in the U.S. president. Still, in most places – including key European countries – confidence in Biden remains higher than confidence in Trump. Israel is the one exception: While 60% of Israelis have confidence in Biden, 71% said the same about Trump in 2019.\n\nOlder adults generally have more confidence in Biden than younger adults. In most countries surveyed, adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden. For example, nearly three-quarters of Belgians ages 50 and older give Biden positive ratings on the world stage, compared with roughly half of Belgians ages 18 to 29. Double-digit differences also exist in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, Japan and France.\n\nIn Hungary, Italy and Poland, the opposite pattern appears: Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have confidence in Biden.\n\nThere is more public approval than disapproval of Biden’s choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan – but low ratings of the withdrawal itself. A median of 52% of adults across 18 countries surveyed say it was the right decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while 39% say it was the wrong decision. Responses vary by region, and in Poland, Israel, Japan and Hungary, roughly two-in-ten do not offer a response.\n\nAcross all 18 countries, a median of just a third of adults (33%) say the withdrawal was handled well. Far more (median of 56%) say it was not handled well.\n\nAmericans’ views of the decision to withdraw troops, as well as the execution of the plan, are largely aligned with views from around the world. Six-in-ten Americans say it was the right decision, while 38% hold the opposite view. And roughly a third (32%) say the withdrawal was handled well, whereas two-thirds (66%) say it was not.\n\nIn places where the U.S. is seen more favorably, so is Biden. For example, the two countries surveyed where people have the most favorable views of the United States – Poland and South Korea – are also among the countries where people have the most confidence in Biden.\n\nIn nearly all countries surveyed, more people express a favorable view of the U.S. than confidence in Biden – though the opposite is true in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Malaysia. In Germany and Australia, the share of adults with a positive view of the U.S. and confidence in Biden are roughly the same. This pattern holds at the individual level as well: Favorable views of the U.S. correlate with positive ratings of Biden.\n\nConfidence in Biden is similar to confidence in other Western leaders. A median of 58% of adults across the 18 surveyed countries have confidence in Biden’s handling of global affairs, just a few points lower than the median share who say the same about French President Emmanuel Macron (61%) and equal to positive ratings of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (58%). Larger shares, however, say they are not confident in Biden than say the same of his German counterpart.\n\nWithin specific countries, there are greater differences in ratings of the three leaders. In Poland and Israel, for instance, larger shares are more confident in Biden than either of his European counterparts, while in Greece, it is Macron who receives the highest ratings.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/4cb89f5a-fb08-403d-892b-0c8e496926e8', 'Headline': 'China hits out at US after Joe Biden calls Xi Jinping a ‘dictator’', 'Snippet': 'Unlock the White House Watch newsletter for free.

He bungled his whereabouts the day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, feeding criticism that at age 80, he is unfit for office.\n\nBut he stuck to a whirlwind schedule, visiting India and Vietnam, appearing at a summit of the world’s wealthiest countries, speaking to more than 20 foreign leaders, holding a news conference and courting countries that the United States needs to create a bulwark against Chinese aggression.\n\nThat’s a lot for anyone and, as he hurtled across continents, the toll started to show. At the press conference Sunday, he struggled to recount the plot of an unnamed John Wayne movie while making a point about climate change.\n\nOn the way home the next day, he stopped in Alaska to mark the anniversary of 9/11. There, he described visiting the wreckage at ground zero in New York one day after the terrorist attack. Yet on that day in 2001, he was in Washington, D.C., delivering remarks on the Senate floor. He and other senators traveled to the site more than a week after the attack. Was that a gaffe born out of fatigue, an honest mistake or an exaggeration from a president with a penchant for dropping himself in the middle of the action? The White House did not comment.\n\nInternational diplomacy isn\'t the only thing on Biden\'s mind these days. A family crisis is also weighing on him. The special counsel investigating his son Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges said in a court filing last week that he plans to seek an indictment of the younger Biden by month\'s end.\n\n""Are you worried about your son being indicted, Mr. President?"" a reporter asked Biden as he was leaving the news conference. Biden kept walking, ignoring the question.\n\nRepublicans were quick to pounce on Biden\'s performance overseas, zeroing in on scattered moments they’ve been weaving together to make a case that he is unfit to serve another four years. An account run by the Republican National Committee posted a snippet of Biden erroneously saying that he was at ground zero the day after the 9/11 attack.\n\nThe White House quickly snapped back. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted video of Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy telling the conservative network’s viewers that Biden had been working “all through the night.”\n\n“Thank you, Peter,” Jean-Pierre wrote.\n\nQuestions about Biden\'s age are already dogging his re-election bid and any flub tends to get outsize attention. An Associated Press-NORC poll last month showed that 77% believed Biden was too old to serve another term. (Only 51% said GOP front-runner Donald Trump, 77, is too old.)\n\n“The American media makes an international story out of every time Joe Biden trips over,” a former Western diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden’s standing with voters.\n\nThe chance of a misstep grows when circling the globe at breakneck speed. During a trip to Japan in 2009, President Barack Obama\'s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, opened a briefing by saying: ""I haven’t the slightest idea what time of day or what day it is, so I’ll just start by saying I hope you all are doing well.""\n\nOther presidents found it hard to adjust and looked for ways to cope. Under the heading “Medications,” a brief note from Obama’s physical exam in 2010 reads: “Jet lag/time zone management … occasional medication use.” Obama was 48 at the time.\n\nAt the start of his presidency, Ronald Reagan was 69 — nine years younger than Biden at the time of his inauguration. Yet, the White House made accommodations for his advancing age.\n\nIn her biography of Nancy Reagan, Karen Tumulty writes about the former first lady’s unhappiness with a European trip that her husband had taken.\n\nNancy Reagan complained to a senior White House aide and from that point on, “Ronnie was never again over-scheduled abroad,” Tumulty writes. In subsequent trips made by Reagan, more days ""would be added to make sure the president made his way across time zones in a leisurely fashion, with time to adjust and arrived rested.” At his wife’s insistence, when Reagan visited China in 1984, he stopped first for rest breaks in California, Hawaii and Guam.\n\n“Mrs. Reagan was very, very focused on the president’s schedule, him having enough downtime and rest time when he arrived before actual meetings started,"" said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush. ""She was just — really after the assassination attempt on his life, she was very, very involved in the schedule.""\n\nWhite House officials aren\'t apologizing for Biden\'s packed schedule. If anything, his itinerary was a useful antidote to the GOP argument that he lacks the stamina to do the job.\n\nConsider a five-hour stretch in Hanoi on Monday. After leaving his hotel around 11:30 a.m. local time, Biden held meetings with Vietnam\'s president and prime minister; joined another official to watch the exchange of Vietnam War artifacts; visited a memorial site for the late Sen. John McCain who was taken prisoner during the war; and took part in a state lunch in which Vietnamese officials toasted to his health. By 4:15 p.m., he was aboard Air Force One, landing in Anchorage 10 hours later for the 9/11 ceremony.\n\nExhausting as Biden\'s trip may have been, foreign policy experts say that he racked up results. Start with the simple fact that Biden showed up for the G20 summit in New Delhi and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, did not. That in itself was a victory for Biden, some analysts said.\n\n“U.S President Joe Biden stepped into the void left by Xi and secured new infrastructure deals aimed at connecting India, the Middle East and Europe,” Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomic Center, wrote in a blog post about the summit.\n\nBeyond that, Vietnam, a country that borders China, elevated its relationship with the U.S. to its highest tier. Biden also rolled out ambitious infrastructure spending plans that may offer other countries an alternative to the “Belt and Road” initiative that China has used to forge international partnerships.\n\nEven as he made diplomatic moves that undercut Beijing, Biden also made personal overtures to Xi — perhaps to entice him to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November.\n\n“I think there’s real doubt in our mind whether or not Xi Jinping comes to APEC,” Matthew Pottinger, a deputy national security adviser in Trump’s White House, said in an interview.\n\nIf Xi decides to come, a face-to-face meeting with Biden would seem inevitable. The two leaders haven’t met in person since the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, last year and relations have since grown increasingly strained.\n\n“Well, I hope to see Mr. Xi sooner than later,” Biden said at his news conference. “I’ve spent more time with him than any other world leader has, sum total, over the last 12 years. So, I hope we get to see him soon.”\n\nBy then, Biden should be rested.\n\n“I don’t know about you, but I’m going to bed,” he said shortly before leaving the stage.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/russia-ukraine-crisis-scorecard-bidens-response', 'Headline': 'The Russia-Ukraine Crisis: A Scorecard on Biden’s Response', 'Snippet': 'Biden held a video meeting with Putin, and a face-to-face meeting could follow.

How well have the president and his senior advisors handled the crisis? The record is mixed: they have shown diplomatic skill in some elements of their response but have conveyed confusion in others. The administration may yet be able to defuse tensions, but it needs to work harder at exposing the absurdity of many Russian demands—and preserving U.S. freedom of action.\n\nMore From Our Experts\n\nHigh marks. U.S. policy has been most successful in two important areas. First, it has been able to maintain near-total unanimity within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Meeting in Latvia in early December, the alliance’s foreign ministers condemned Russian military pressures on Ukraine. Subsequent meetings, both in Washington and in European capitals, have shown similar unity. Second, these statements sent the same strong message: a Russian invasion would trigger new U.S. and European sanctions dwarfing those that followed the 2014 crisis, when Russia seized Crimea and started the separatist war in eastern Ukraine. European leaders, many feared, would muddy this message in separate meetings or calls with Putin, but they haven’t done so.\n\nA passing grade—with question marks. Other elements of the administration’s record are more problematic. It has tried (appropriately) to defuse the crisis by moving from possible military confrontation to diplomatic give-and-take. Biden held a video meeting with Putin, and a face-to-face meeting could follow. Also, senior U.S. officials visited Moscow to explore Russian complaints, and more formal talks are expected in January. Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security advisor, has described the agenda of such talks as the same one the United States and Russia have discussed “for decades,” meaning items such as force levels and deployments in Europe or the range and capabilities of advanced weapons systems.\n\nMore on:\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nJoe Biden\n\nNATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)\n\nYet none of these negotiations granted Russia the “sphere of influence” that now seems its primary goal. Putin and his advisors are clearly determined to get Western governments to put this issue on the agenda of new talks. In reply, U.S. officials have labeled some Russian demands, such as the removal of NATO troops and weapons from states that joined the alliance after the Cold War, “unacceptable.” They have not, however, dispelled the impression that Washington will eventually agree to discuss these demands—or that Putin’s military threats have obliged them to do so.\n\nFlunking the test. The Biden administration’s record has been weakest in two critical areas. First, it has made no sustained effort to counter Putin’s insistence that he is merely responding to the West’s own “obviously aggressive stance”—crucial for Russian domestic audiences. The Kremlin’s claim that NATO threatens Russian security is belied by the tiny, partly symbolic Western military presence in, for example, the three Baltic states. (U.S. rotational deployments are greatest in Lithuania and usually top out at about six hundred troops.) That such forces create a serious defense capability is dubious at best; that they represent an offensive threat of any kind is laughable.\n\nMore From Our Experts\n\nSecond, in threatening economic sanctions in the event of further aggression against Ukraine, Washington is downplaying other measures that might be needed even if Russia calls off an invasion. After the Cold War, NATO built no permanent military presence in Eastern Europe, and troop levels in Western Europe declined sharply. Only marginal forward deployments followed the 2014 crisis. Now, Putin’s actions and rhetoric are forcing a reexamination of this strategy. U.S. officials should make clear that future force levels will depend above all on how much Moscow threatens its neighbors. The Biden administration’s handling of the current crisis will be measured by whether the United States remains free to give allies and partners the support they need to keep Europe at peace.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/29/opinions/biden-democracy-israel-ukraine-taiwan-andelman/index.html', 'Headline': 'Opinion: Joe Biden is not getting the credit he deserves on foreign ...', 'Snippet': 'Opinion: Biden is making more foreign policy messes than he’s fixing.

Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, is a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, author of “A Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen” and blogs at SubStack’s Andelman Unleashed. He formerly was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCritics claim that President Joe Biden has failed in his efforts to project American power effectively for the American people and their allies around the world. But I am confident he will go down in history, as he should, for being one of the rare presidents who has accomplished something quite extraordinary: He has carefully defined and quite successfully defended democracy and democratic values before a host of existential challenges.\n\nFormer Presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush wound up ping-ponging from crisis to crisis with no clear sense of what shape the horizon might take, frequently updating their worldviews to match the moment. Bush was against nation-building until he was for it in Afghanistan and Iraq; Obama was against foreign intervention until he was for it in Libya; Trump was for sweet-talking global adversaries until he was against it.\n\nBiden, in contrast, has been operating on the basis of a real weltanschauung (or worldview). Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told me and other students in his class at Harvard that few leaders, especially presidents of the United States, operated on the world stage with a clear-eyed sense of where they want the world to be at the end of their four or eight years and then worked to get there.\n\nAnd indeed, few have defined and embraced democracy as a doctrine, viewed crises and partners through such a prism and worked so effectively to further these essential values more than Biden, who spent decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and eight years as vice president before becoming the leader of the Free World.\n\nBiden’s latest challenge, of course, is in Israel and Gaza. In the face of a barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel and the unrelenting response of the government under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden has stood squarely by Israel, defined by The Economist’s Democracy Index as the only democracy in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIn contrast to George W. Bush, Biden has modeled how diplomacy as well as force can support efforts to shore up democracy. The US reportedly played a crucial role in getting many Israeli hostages released from Hamas. But the US also quickly dispatched two aircraft carrier strike groups and 900 additional troops to the Middle East to back up his warning to Iran and Hezbollah not to broaden the conflict.\n\nThose moves not only safeguard Israel but help secure American interests in the region and show that a democratic power can constrain fundamentalist ones.\n\nBiden is similar to other presidents in getting little credit for what doesn’t happen. Beyond containing the Israel-Hamas conflict (so far), he also hasn’t been properly recognized for avoiding a direct US-Russia confrontation — and likely conflagration — by tempering the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine and restraining its efforts to join NATO, even as the US has slowly but steadily ratcheted up the levels of military support for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, of course, is trying desperately to retain its democratic orientation in the face of Moscow’s violent and autocratic challenge. Though now facing obstacles in Congress, there’s no question that the Biden administration’s support has been essential to Ukraine’s impressive — and, to many, unexpected —success in its continued fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression.\n\nThen there’s Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping has redoubled efforts to build pressure to force the island nation’s absorption into mainland China, sending warships and warplanes ever closer to Taiwan — even into and through its airspace. But a still-independent government in Taipei is planning a democratic presidential election on January 13, a robust three-way race in which voters consider an outcome that could well define the island’s future.\n\nThis is happening with determined American political, diplomatic and military support, including Biden being clearer than previous presidents that the US will defend Taiwan. Despite GOP foot-dragging in Congress, Biden has included funding for Taiwan as well as Ukraine and Israel in a new aid package — an all-but-unprecedented effort at American assistance for democracies under threat.\n\nBut while he’s minced no words in continuing to call Xi “a dictator,” Biden has managed the relationship with Beijing rather than rupturing it in ways that could be dangerous. Just this fall, he succeeded in reopening military-to-military channels of communication with China for the first time since Beijing severed them after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022.\n\nThose who see Biden’s abrupt and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan as a failure that damages his record on democracy have themselves failed to recognize a reality that Biden had earlier come to appreciate.\n\nIn Afghanistan, democracy never really took root at all. Its ill-conceived and improbable “elections” were little more than window dressing on a deeply flawed and corrupt kleptocracy that America had been backing with the bodies of thousands of its troops.\n\nAs Sarah Chayes, once a special assistant in the Pentagon, wrote in Foreign Affairs, “Joe Biden was outspoken about his opposition to the intervention.” That underscores the point that Biden’s success isn’t just his principled view of democracies (George W. Bush also prominently called for democratization) but shrewdness in knowing when and where to promote them most effectively.\n\nOne could ask what happens when Biden finds himself facing a leader with anti-democratic tendencies like India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who presides over what close observers have called “an electoral autocracy” in what was long a model democratic nation. There, it would appear, Biden has shown steadiness in waiting for the forces that propelled other truly democratic leaders of India’s past to harness the will of the people to return them to power.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The exchange soon spread widely on social media and on conservative news sites, where it was framed as a bombshell admission by Pfizer.\n\n""Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?"" Roos asked.\n\nAfter two other Parliament members asked questions, Small responded to Roos\' query.\n\n""Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market … no,"" said Small, presumably meaning to say ""transmission"" and not ""immunization."" ""We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.""\n\nThe Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\n""This is scandalous,"" Roos later said in a video he shared on Twitter, arguing that the admonition to ""get vaccinated for others was always a lie."" He also appeared on Fox News on Oct. 11, discussing the exchange with host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBut Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and news reports before the vaccine’s approval were clear that while the vaccine was effective in preventing symptomatic and severe disease, there was no data about whether it stopped transmission to others.\n\nSome may have been surprised at Small’s answer, given public officials’ comments about vaccines and transmission. Both Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said that vaccination can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC in May 2021 changed its guidance on masking, with Fauci saying on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that vaccinated people’s chances of transmitting the virus to others was low. The agency reversed course on that guidance two months later, when it became clear that wasn’t the case with the delta variant.\n\nBut the notion that Pfizer ""admitted"" it didn’t test its vaccine for its ability to stop transmission is incorrect.\n\nAndrew Widger, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said in a statement that details of its phase 3 clinical trial have been online since 2020, and that the trial was never intended to study transmission.\n\nThe phase 3 clinical trial was ""designed and powered"" to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease, Widger said. ""Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,"" he said, which means it wasn’t an outcome being studied.\n\nThe FDA, meanwhile, said in its Dec. 11, 2020, announcement of emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine that there wasn’t yet ""evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person."" A Pfizer press release that same day and another announcing its approval in the European Union on Dec. 21, 2020, made no mention of the vaccine’s effect on transmission.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the outcomes being measured in the original vaccine trials for Pfizer and Moderna were always about their effectiveness against ""symptomatic COVID-19.""\n\n""So, the prevention of transmission (and asymptomatic COVID) were not primary endpoints of these trials and were never a claim of the pharmaceutical companies in developing these vaccines,"" Gandhi said, adding, ""Indeed, this revelation is not new.""\n\nTara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiology professor, agreed, saying the Pfizer executive’s statement was ""not a ‘gotcha.’"" In a December 2020 article for the online website SELF, Smith wrote that the vaccine’s ability to stop transmission was an unanswered question, noting that it’s common in initial vaccine trials for that topic to be addressed in later studies.\n\n""We were hopeful in spring/early summer 2021 that vaccines would be effective against transmission. Delta did change that a bit, making it clear that while vaccines did, and still do, help to reduce one’s risk of infection, they alone are not enough to stop transmission,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That’s why many of us were and remain frustrated at CDC’s messaging around masks, suggesting the vaccinated could stop masking.""\n\nBefore the delta and omicron variants came along, studies suggested that the vaccines were somewhat effective in slowing transmission of the coronavirus.\n\n""In the era before omicron, and to some extent the delta variant, the vaccines clearly were transmission-halting to a high degree,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOnce variants began evading vaccine immunity and breakthrough infections became more common, he added, vaccines were less likely to stop transmission.\n\nWhen Walensky ""said that vaccines decrease transmission and therefore, getting vaccinated protected others, she was providing accurate information to the American public based on data at the time,"" said Gandhi.\n\nIt’s clear that the vaccines are not a firewall against transmission to others, despite misleading claims on two occasions by President Joe Biden that we fact-checked in 2021.\n\nCurrently, Gandhi said, a recent study during the Omicron surge showed that vaccines or prior infection each decreased transmission to others by about 20%.\n\n""The pharmaceutical companies and the CDC both were accurate in terms of their messaging and reporting on the vaccines over time in terms of their ability to reduce transmission and — currently — their incredible ability to reduce severe disease due to the generation of cellular immunity,"" Gandhi said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Instagram post claimed that a Pfizer executive suddenly ""admitted"" that its COVID-19 vaccine had not been tested for preventing transmission before it went to market.\n\nBut this is not a revelation. Pfizer’s clinical trial was always intended to study whether the vaccine prevented recipients from getting symptomatic COVID-19 and whether it prevented severe disease.

That means all the Pfizer vaccine data should be public by the end of September rather than the year 2097, the deadline that the FDA wanted.\n\n“Here, the court recognizes the ‘unduly burdensome’ challenges that this [Freedom of Information Act] request may present to the FDA,” the court ruling noted. “But, as expressed at the scheduling conference, there may not be a ‘more important issue at the Food and Drug Administration … than the pandemic, the Pfizer vaccine, getting every American vaccinated, [and] making sure that the American public is assured that this was not rush[ed] on behalf of the United States.”\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD VACCINE-OR-TEST MANDATE\n\nPittman’s ruling requires the FDA to start producing documents at an expedited pace — more than 12,000 pages before Jan. 31.

""The facts are clear. Pfizer did not tell the truth about their COVID-19 vaccines.""\n\nIn all, Paxton\'s 54-page complaint acts as a compendium of pandemic-era anti-vaccine misinformation and tropes while making a slew of unsupported claims. But, central to the Lone Star State\'s shaky legal argument is one that centers on the standard math Pfizer used to assess the effectiveness of its vaccine: a calculation of relative risk reduction.\n\nThis argument is as unoriginal as it is incorrect. Anti-vaccine advocates have championed this flawed math-based theory since the height of the pandemic. Actual experts have roundly debunked it many times. Still, it appears in all its absurd glory in Paxton\'s lawsuit last week, which seeks $10 million in reparations.\n\nMath argument\n\nBriefly, the lawsuit and the anti-vaccine rhetoric before it argues that Pfizer should have presented its vaccine\'s effectiveness in terms of absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction. Doing so would have made the highly effective COVID-19 vaccine appear extremely ineffective. Based on relative risk reduction in a two-month trial, Pfizer\'s vaccine appeared 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19—as Pfizer advertised. Using the same trial data but calculating absolute risk reduction, however, the vaccine effectiveness would have been 0.85 percent.\n\nThe difference between the two calculations is quite simple: Absolute risk reduction is a matter of subtraction—the percentage point drop in risk of a disease between an untreated and treated group. So, for example, if a group of untreated people have a 60 percent risk of developing a disease, but, when treated, the risk drops to 10 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 50 percent (60 – 10 = 50).\n\nRelative risk reduction involves division—the percent change difference between the two groups\' risks. So, as in the previous example, if a treatment lowers disease risk from 60 percent to 10 percent, the relative risk reduction is 83 percent (50 percent drop / 60 percent initial risk = ~0.83).\n\nBoth numbers can be helpful when weighing the risks and benefits of treatments, but absolute risk reduction is particularly key when there\'s a low risk of a disease. This can be easily understood by simply moving the decimal in the above example. If a treatment lowers a person\'s disease risk from 6 percent to 1 percent, the relative risk reduction is still 83 percent—an impressive number that might argue for treatment—but the absolute risk reduction is a paltry 5 percent—which could easily be negated by any potential side effects or high costs.\n\nCalculation context\n\nSimilar calculations were seen in Pfizer\'s trial: Of 17,411 vaccinated people, eight developed COVID-19 during the trial (0.045 percent), while 162 of 17,511 people in the placebo group developed the infection (0.9 percent). The relative risk reduction is 95 percent, while the absolute risk reduction is a decidedly unimpressive 0.85 percent.\n\nFor this reason, anti-vaccine advocates have seized upon absolute risk calculations as a way to downplay the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines. But this steamrolls over the reason relative risk is used to examine vaccine effectiveness against infectious disease. Absolute risk is most helpful when it\'s relatively stable and can be confidently calculated, such as calculating the risk of cardiovascular disease in a person, given their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In these cases, absolute risk reduction is very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment. But using absolute risk for infectious diseases is often simply nonsensical because absolute risk can vary dramatically by space, time, and many other factors.\n\nFor instance, a person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season. Or, if a person hops on a plane, traveling from an area with no endemic malaria directly into an area with a raging malaria outbreak, their absolute risk of infection will skyrocket when they land. And, of course, if people are under lockdowns or health restrictions—as was the case early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pfizer\'s vaccine trials were running—their absolute risk can rise significantly when those lockdowns and restrictions are lifted—as was the case in 2021 after the vaccine\'s release.\n\nWith absolute risk so variable, relative risk is a more helpful measure of a vaccine\'s effectiveness—and the relative risk reduction applies regardless of what a person\'s absolute risk is at a given point in time.\n\nArtificial numbers\n\nAnother key reason it\'s safe to ignore absolute risk reduction in vaccine trial data is that it is often entirely artificial. These trials are designed to enroll large numbers of people with the full knowledge that only a small percentage will be exposed during the trial. And they\'re designed with trigger points—in other words, when the trial hits a pre-determined number of infections, effectiveness is calculated.\n\nIn Pfizer\'s trial, the trigger point was at or around 170. But, if the trial runners had set the trigger point somewhere else, the absolute risk reduction could easily have been different, even if everything else was the same. For instance, if it was set to 510 and there were 24 cases in the vaccine groups (0.13 percent) and 486 cases in the placebo group (2.8 percent), the relative risk reduction would still be 95 percent, but the absolute risk reduction would be 2.67 percent, not 0.85 percent.\n\nIf Pfizer had waited for all 35,000 or so people in the trial to be exposed to COVID-19 amid widespread lockdowns, it would have needlessly delayed the evaluation and release of the vaccines.\n\nAn analysis from last year estimated that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the first two years after their release.\n\nIn a statement to Stat, Pfizer noted the benefits and safety of its vaccine, saying that its representations of its vaccine ""have been accurate and science-based. [Pfizer] believes that the state’s case has no merit and will respond to the petition in court in due course.""'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/may/12/instagram-posts/pfizers-23-billion-settlement-was-not-related-to-c/', 'Headline': 'Pfizer’s $2.3 billion settlement was not related to COVID-19 vaccines', 'Snippet': 'We rate the claim that the video shows Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion in a health care fraud settlement involving COVID-19 vaccines False.

[1]', 'Full_text': 'COVID-19 elimination strategy\n\n""Zero-COVID policy"" redirects here. For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-zero-covid-policy-how-does-it-work-2022-11-03/', 'Headline': ""What is China's zero-COVID policy and how does it work?"", 'Snippet': 'Nearly three years into the pandemic, China is sticking with a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has caused mounting economic damage and widespread frustration, while keeping its borders ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00873-X/fulltext', 'Headline': 'Zero COVID in China: what next? - The Lancet', 'Snippet': ""The zero-COVID strategy has been the pillar of China's anti-epidemic policies for over 2 years.

Each country and city may have its own unique circumstances that require additional considerations and adaptations [1]. China has a population of 1.41 billion. Due to this huge population base, China’s reopening policy during the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a scientific, gradual, and cautious approach. Preparations for the epidemic and changes in the external environment have created conditions for the reopening [2], including the evolvement of the external environment, gradual formation of the COVID-19 immune barrier, the increased awareness of virus prevention, the advancement in COVID-19 treatment, lower virulence of the Omicron variant [3], and the decreased severe COVID-19 rate and mortality rate [4].\n\nExpansion of healthcare capacity\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the reopening policy, mainly in the following aspects: First, to prepare for potential risks of medical resource overloading associated with the reopening, in the past 3 years, the National Health Commission of China has taken measures to expand healthcare capacity and make progress in treating COVID-19. Common fever clinics have been opened and critical care beds have been expanded to alleviate medical overloading. Medical institutions across the country have strengthened their respiratory infectious disease prevention and control capabilities, with increased medical beds and equipment, as well as improved medical rescue abilities. Moreover, China’s medical grading diagnosis and treatment system plays an important role in meeting the needs of patients and effectively operating the primary medical system. Antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been included in medical insurance through fast-approval channels, and maximum efforts are being made to provide drugs to patients in need. The government and health departments at all levels are providing human, financial, and material support to primary medical institutions to help establish an effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment mode.\n\nDuring the reopening period, China focused on enhancing the ability to treat severe COVID-19 cases, improving the efficiency of transferring severe cases, and preventing mild cases from becoming severe. The collective efforts of the public governance system helped to meet medical needs and navigate the peak of infections.\n\nVaccination program\n\nSecond, SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines have played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China [5]. With the widespread promotion and the national free vaccination policy, by early November 2022, over 90% of the total population had completed the full course of the new coronavirus vaccine. Research conducted by the National Major Scientific and Technological Infrastructure for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center showed that among infected individuals aged 60 or older who received two to three doses of the inactivated coronavirus vaccine, the rate of severe illness protection reached 90.15% [6]. The rate of severe illness protection for all infected individuals was reported to be 96.02%. Data released by a research team from the University of Hong Kong also supported the efficacy of domestically produced inactivated vaccines in preventing severe illness and death [7].\n\nEpidemic prevention and control mechanism\n\nThird, over the past 3 years, China has improved its epidemic prevention and control mechanism for COVID-19. The “State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism” was established as a multidepartment coordination platform to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. Through this mechanism, many local outbreaks have been successfully controlled, and guidelines have been developed by the National Health Commission and experts in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, medical treatment, and public health policy. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for New Coronavirus Infection” has been updated ten times to provide up-to-date strategies and recommendations.\n\nWeakened viral virulence\n\nLast but not the least, the variant of SARS-CoV‑2 is accompanied by variable characteristics of the clinical picture, with disease severity appearing to be lower with the Omicron variant [8]. Some scientists warned that this does not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed less virulence than previous variants of concern and lung function was less compromised [9]. There is growing evidence to suggest that, with the protection of vaccines and improved treatment conditions, the harm of COVID-19 to the population has significantly decreased over time [10].\n\nThese are just some of the prerequisites for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus is highly contagious, and the short-term surge in confirmed cases is an undoubtful challenge faced by medical institutions after the reopening. The 3‑year period of hard and effective epidemic prevention and control in China has won valuable time and experience for the comprehensive opening up of the country. It seems that the threat of the virus to the population has become more manageable; thus, ending the dynamic zero-COVID policy and reopening the country supports economic recovery and international cooperation. In 2022, Omicron became the dominant strain in China, with a weakened pathogenicity resulting in mostly mild symptoms and a small proportion of severe cases. With high vaccination rates and effective epidemic control measures, the focus shifted from “dynamic clearance” to “protecting vulnerable populations.” On January 7, 2023, the State Council issued the 10th edition of the prevention and control plan, which emphasized vaccination and personal protection, optimized testing strategies, and outlined emergency measures during the epidemic.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China. From April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and ...', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63226230', 'Headline': 'China congress: Xi Jinping doubles down on zero-Covid as meeting ... - BBC', 'Snippet': 'Zero-Covid was a ""people\'s war to stop the spread of the virus"", he said.

The emergence of highly ..."", 'Full_text': ""Over the past 3 years, China’s ‘zero COVID' policy has contained numerous outbreaks and averted an estimated 1.5 million deaths across all socio-economic strata1. The emergence of highly transmissible Omicron variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that sustaining this policy is unfeasible, with mounting economic costs and growing public dissatisfaction2. In mid-November 2022, the National Health Commission released 20 measures toward gradual relaxation of the ‘zero COVID’ policy3. This was further streamlined to 10 measures in early December as the most substantial move so far toward living with the virus4. This included allowing home isolation for mild symptoms, dropping testing requirements for most venues and domestic travel, implementing targeted rather than large-scale lockdowns, and emphasizing the vaccination and boosting of people over 60 years of age. As China grapples with its largest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, these measures have largely been welcomed after 3 years of the most stringent control measures of any country.\n\nA pro-equity focus is needed alongside relaxed policies for COVID-19, given the disproportionate impact of the disease on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, which generally have lower vaccination rates5, especially as immunity wanes6. Socio-economic disadvantage lowers a person’s ability to adhere to measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, vaccination and self-isolation7. Factors related to this include inadequate health literacy, which may be positively associated with vaccine hesitancy; overcrowded living and working conditions; limited income to afford personal protective equipment; and limited benefits such as sick leave8.\n\nInvestment is needed to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on at-risk socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Access to high-quality healthcare services such as intensive care unit beds has been lacking, especially in the socio-economically deprived areas of central and Western China9, which could greatly reduce access to timely treatment. People on low incomes are often less aware of their chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) status and have less access to effective treatment for NCDs, which in turn places them at greater risk for COVID-19 sequelae10. Although the new COVID-19 measures have increased resources for treatment, ongoing limitations of health service availability in socio-economically deprived areas pose challenges for adequate treatment use. Furthermore, it is unclear if existing financial subsidies for covering out-of-pocket expenditure for COVID-19 treatment will be sustained, particularly as increasing cases of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 emerge. Ending these subsidies would pose financial risks for those on low incomes or with limited health coverage.\n\nWe believe that the following actions are critical to avoid reinforcing existing health inequities as China develops its new policy approach. First, accelerate universal vaccination, including highly effective booster shots, among the general population, focusing on outreach to older people in socio-economically deprived rural areas, where there is limited access to health services. Vaccination programs should target those working in industries that require frequent close contact with others, informal migrant workers, and those in dense living conditions. Second, promote universal masking in higher-risk settings, and continue access to affordable personal protective equipment and testing. This includes the direct provision or offer of subsidies to low-income households, as well as low-cost or free testing. Third, offer COVID-19 treatments to all, in order to prevent substantial mortality from COVID-19, particularly in at-risk communities. This could include mobilizing trained health personnel to provide treatment, including anti-viral agents and oxygen therapy, for people with severe COVID-19 in areas with limited healthcare services, during the winter months, when cases are likely to be higher. Fourth, collect socio-economic demographic data on routine health records. This would support the monitoring of health inequities, including those related to COVID-19, as well as facilitate targeted health interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nFifth, promote preventative behaviors, together with free primary health screening for NCDs, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are underlying risk factors for COVID-19. These measures are in line with the Healthy China 2030 plan, which emphasizes a life-course approach to NCD prevention and management. This could provide opportunities for promoting COVID-19 vaccination and risk reduction, as well as opportunities to strengthen the quality of care for NCD management. An ongoing commitment to investing in health infrastructure, capacity building and affordable NCD management in the most resource-limited regions of China would support equitable access to high-quality healthcare services, including those for COVID-19.\n\nShifting resources away from intensive ‘zero COVID’ measures and onto targeted public health interventions, with an emphasis on socio-economically disadvantaged communities, would be the most equitable way forward.

At that time, the omicron ...', 'Full_text': 'For the first time in three years, millions traveled within China earlier this month to reunite with loved ones for the country’s most important holiday, the Lunar New Year. Unfortunately, these celebrations coincided with — and are sure to exacerbate — a Covid-19 outbreak currently spreading throughout the country.\n\nThis spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.\n\nThese initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.\n\nBeijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.\n\nAlthough a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in.\n\nLockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.\n\n“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”\n\nLockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\n\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.\n\nMany countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.\n\nChina had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.”\n\nIn the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.\n\nMeanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.\n\nInstead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nIn mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.\n\nWhy China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\n\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.\n\nHowever, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.\n\nUnlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.\n\nRather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.\n\nFor example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.\n\nOther countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.\n\nAs part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.\n\nYet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”\n\nThat said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”\n\nLack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.\n\n“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”\n\nWhat this teaches us for the next pandemic\n\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases. And lockdowns, when used appropriately and swiftly, remain a useful tool in our arsenal for early pandemic days.\n\nCovid-19 was actually the “ideal candidate” for lockdowns, said Miller. This is because of the virus’s highly transmissible, airborne, and often asymptomatic nature. “Candidates for lockdown include pathogens that are novel to human populations, and therefore there is no innate immunity to them,” Miller said. “Highly infectious pathogens for which there are (currently) no vaccines or treatments are also candidates for lockdown.” In theory, the only type of diseases that lockdowns cannot mitigate are those that are not transmitted via human-to-human contact, such as water or foodborne illnesses, said Bouey.\n\nLockdowns give leaders time to develop vaccination distribution campaigns, set up contact tracing programs, and learn more about the pandemic-causing disease, Miller added.\n\nThis is why it’s important to distinguish between “short-term lockdowns with underlying goals” and “long-term lockdowns that hope to beat the odds and keep Covid out indefinitely,” said Miller. Brief lockdowns that helped “flatten the curve” were effective and helped keep hospitalizations and deaths down. But extended lockdowns, like the ones seen in China, failed to contain the virus and damaged the country’s economy and well-being.\n\n“As we have seen, these lockdowns are very disruptive, in terms of economic livelihood, as well as social life and even mental health,” said Bouey. “There is profound damage to the society and to the economy.”'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/china/china-zero-covid-impact-beijing-intl-hnk-mic/index.html', 'Headline': 'China scraps virus tracking app as country braces for Covid impact', 'Snippet': 'Beijing CNN —.

Sign up here.\n\nChina is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.\n\nChanges continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.\n\nThe system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.\n\nIt had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.\n\nBut as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.\n\nThroughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.'}}",95.625,1

Legislators gathered back in November for the first time since adjournment in April 2022 for a two-week Veto Session. The two-week term was rather quiet, with legislators opting to leave many of the “bigger” issues unresolved until the Lame Duck Session, which ran from January 4 through January 11.\n\nWith numerous proposals being considered during that time, the Chicagoland Chamber worked to ensure that the interests of the Chicago business community were well represented.\n\nChamber and Business Groups Negotiate Successful Resolution of Historic $4.5B Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Deficit\n\nDuring the 2022 fall Veto Session and January 2023 Lame Duck Session, the Chamber, working with business partner organizations, labor representatives, the Governor’s Office, and the General Assembly, agreed to a package that eliminates the $4.5 billion Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deficit that accumulated during the early days of the pandemic, saving employers nearly a billion dollars in higher unemployment insurance taxes.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Chamber and other business groups successfully negotiated the utilization of $2.7 billion of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to be applied to the $4.5 billion Title XII debt incurred during the pandemic—largely in 2020, when government-mandated closures and operating restrictions were imposed on businesses. At the time, almost every other state used ARPA funds for repaying UI trust fund debt. Per federal law, when a state Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund drops to a negative balance, federal funds are automatically borrowed. If the borrowing occurs for a period of two or more years, employers lose credit against their federal unemployment insurance tax—meaning employers will pay higher taxes.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pritzker Administration swapped $450 million from the state UI Trust Fund balance to further pay down a portion of the $1.8 billion federal Title XII debt left outstanding after the $2.7 billion payment was made in mid-2022. Then in December, Governor Pritzker signed SB 1698 (P.A. 102-1105) to provide for the substantive language of the deal, which (1) authorizes the State to use surplus revenues to pay the remaining $1.36 billion Title XII debt and (2) provides for the substantive agreement reached between business and labor groups. The final deal will mitigate tax increases on employers, improve predictability for employers, and bring greater stability to the UI Trust Fund, which was an initial ask of the labor groups. The deal is fair for both employers and workers. In the January Lame Duck Session, SB 2801 passed both the Illinois House and Senate to provide for the appropriation language necessary to finalize the agreement. It is expected that the Governor will sign the bill soon.\n\nThe UI deal is significant for Illinois employers and negates roughly $913 million in additional taxes that employers would have had to pay over the next five years. Perhaps, just as importantly, the deal and bipartisan roll call that ensued preserves the Unemployment Insurance Agreed Bill process, which has been in place since the 1980s and informally requires any legislation impacting the Unemployment Insurance System from advancing without an agreement from both business and labor groups. Without the agreed bill process, we most certainly would see annual employer tax increases. You can find the Chamber and business coalitions fact sheet on the agreement here.\n\nBusiness Development Proposal Passes with Chamber’s Strong Support\n\nEvery year, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce advocates for more State funding, support, and investment by the State in business development. Although the State has many programs and services in place that are meant to help employers throughout the state, amendments are often required.\n\nThe Government Relations team successfully managed to secure transformational changes to some of these state programs, including the following:\n\nGovernor’s “Invest in Illinois” Program: Given the State received an unexpected amount of tax revenue in 2022, due in large part to the lingering positive impact of the pandemic on consumer spending and business earnings, the Governor proposed the creation of a “closing fund”, which would grant the State the ability to offer new or existing businesses that are relocating, expanding, or making substantial investments in Illinois the ability to offer one-time cash grants to incentivize the projects. Other states, such as Ohio, Texas, among others, have perennial closing funds that they use to attract projects to their states. This year, the General Assembly headed the call and created the Invest in Illinois Program. $400 million were allocated to the program this year.\n\nEDGE Tax Credit Program. The bill (1) increases EDGE credits in projects located in underserved areas equal to 50% of the tax attributed to retained employees, (2) erodes the ‘but for” clause requiring EDGE credit applicants from demonstrating other State offers and cost differentials; and (3) reduces the requirement to self-certification. The EDGE program is one of the State’s biggest economic development tools used to attract and retain jobs in Illinois through a series of income and payroll tax credits.\n\nFilm Tax Credit Program. Extends the sunset date of the program from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2033 to allow prospective film or TV productions to have reliability in the program. The Film Tax Credit Program each year helps sustain the rapid growth of the film and TV industry in Illinois by offering productions with several tax incentives to film in Illinois.\n\nExpands Enterprise Zones. Expands the allowable square mileage of a Zone. The EZ program allows for various tax benefits to be offered to businesses that are activated in a Zone.\n\nImproves High Impact Business Program. Doubles the length of an allowable designation of a HIB and removes the requirement for businesses to prove that the incentive is needed. HIB is a tool that the State offers large business expansions or investments in new projects in the State.\n\nREV Credit Program. Expands the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) in Illinois Act (currently, Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act) to allow renewable energy product manufacturers to be eligible for REV credits, in addition to changing eligibility requirements to allow small-to-mid size businesses to apply for the credit. REV was first created in 2021 to incentivize new electric vehicle manufacturers and component part manufacturers to build in Illinois.\n\nMakes changes to the MICRO Act to grant DCEO the ability to determine criteria for the renewal of incentives provided under the Act. Increases the amount of MICRO credits for projects meeting retained employee goals to match new employee incentives. Allows for MICRO credits to be renewed for a total of either 20 or 30 years.\n\nCreates a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase sales tax credit from fuel purchased in Illinois by an air carrier from June 1, 2023 to January 1, 2033 in the amount of $1.50 per gallon of sustainable fuel. Prohibits the collection of the credit on soybean oil-derived SAF until air carriers collectively purchase SAF containing 10 million gallons of soybean oil feedstock.\n\n“Paid Leave for All Workers Act” Passes, Chamber Negotiates Deal\n\nPaid Leave is an issue that has been hotly debated for over five years in the Statehouse, with advocates typically leading the way to push for convoluted, onerous, and punitive proposals on employers. An agreement was finally brokered last week—with the Chamber playing a key role in making sure the best deal for business was reached.\n\nOnce it was clear that advocacy groups, unions, and Democratic leadership were eager to pass a bill in the last week of Session before the start of a new term, the business community came to the negotiating table seeking two main provisions: (1) require that any paid leave law passed by the General Assembly would be clear, easily implemented, and require no more than five days of leave and (2) prohibit the City of Chicago or Cook County (both jurisdictions that already have paid sick leave mandates in place) from enacting their own version of paid leave. In the end, through much negotiation, the final bill that has been sent to the Governor for his signature will contain the following:\n\n5 days of paid time off a year\n\nThere is no requirement for an employee to qualify why their leave is being taken, easing the administrative burden on employers\n\nThe employer may establish a specific process by which an employee may request time off if the request is made prospectively\n\nThe time may be front loaded or rolled-over\n\nExempts collective bargaining agreements\n\nRequires employers to maintain proper records for no less than three years\n\nFor employers that already have a leave policy in place that meets the requirements of this new law, no policy change is required\n\nProhibits retaliation\n\nAllows the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) to investigate any claims alleging a violation of the Law, and allows the IDOL to impose fines ranging from $500-$1000 for violations of the act, in addition to legal awards and additional civil penalties.\n\nThe new Law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and does not apply to any employer that is currently subject to the paid sick leave ordinances that are in effect in the City of Chicago or Cook County.\n\nOther Notable Action\n\nSB 1720 (Sims/Harris) – FY23 BIMP 2.0, which has passed both Chambers and needs to be signed into law by 12 p.m. on January 16 in order for the salary increases to go into effect. Notable provisions include:\n\nProvides for increased salaries for Constitutional Officers, Agency Directors, and members of the General Assembly\n\nThe establishment of the Warehouse Safety Standards Task Force\n\n$5 million to DCEO to administer a Local Chamber Recovery Grants program\n\nAllows the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board to make grants to local units of governments and schools for the purpose of hiring and retaining law enforcement officials\n\nIncreases the cap on the Budget Stabilization Fund from 5% to 7.5% of total general funds estimated for the fiscal year and transfer $850 million from GRF to the Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nProvides the authorizing language to appropriate $460 million to hospitals throughout Illinois as hospital pandemic recovery stabilization payments\n\nProvides that, if and only if House Bill 4285 of the 102nd General Assembly becomes law, then the small purchase limit in the Procurement Code is reduced from $250,000 to $100,000\n\nHB 969 (Harris/Harmon) – FY23 Supplemental Appropriations package\n\nSB 2801 (Holmes/Welch) – Finalizes the agreed-bill Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund deal to (1) appropriate $1.37 billion from GRF to UI Trust Fund to pay the remaining outstanding federal UI Title VII debt and (2) appropriate $450 million to the UI Trust Fund as a loan to be repaid over a 10-year period. The bill as amended by the House Exec Committee unanimously is awaiting House Floor action before going back to the Senate for concurrence.\n\nSB 1001 (Belt/Zalewski) – Eliminates state and local fees for liquor delivery throughout Illinoi and brings parity for liquor delivery between home-rule and non-home rule municipalities to regulate liquor delivery.\n\nHB 240 (Jones/Gillespie) – Hospital and health care omnibus package\n\nHB 4412 (Willis/Cunnningham) as amended by SA #1 – Limited changes to various energy-related provisions. The most controversial changes pertain to facility siting changes opposed by some units of local government.\n\nHB 268 (Williams/Feigenholtz) as amended by SA #1 – Creates the Tourism Preservation and Sustainability District Act, otherwise known as Tourism Improvement Districts. Similar to Business Improvement Districts, the legislation allows hotel owners to opt into a districts whereby special surcharges are assessed to be used only for the development, services, and benefits of the businesses contained in the Tourism Improvement District.

We made repeated efforts to negotiate in good faith to reach a paid leave policy at the City level that is fair and balanced for both workers and businesses, even offering double the State requirement, but labor groups refused to compromise meaningfully, with aldermen now set to vote on a policy that will devastate the very businesses they have been trying to attract to their communities.\n\nThe current proposal will force employers to pay three ways for every day of paid leave. As written, employers will need to provide five days of paid sick leave and five days of paid time off for every employee, pay employees for up to seven days of unused paid time off, and pay enhanced wages for anyone who covers the employee’s shift due to the City’s restrictive scheduling ordinance. On top of this, businesses, especially small businesses without robust human resources departments, will be exposed to the threat of private rights of action. The payout exemption for small businesses contained in the proposal does not extend to this dangerous private right of action language contained in the ordinance.\n\nOnce again, proponents failed to recognize the compounding effect these policies have on businesses that are already struggling to make ends meet due to an alarming number of anti-business proposals by the City, continued supply chain and labor challenges, persistent crime, and skyrocketing property taxes.\n\nWe regularly hear about the need to attract and retain businesses like restaurants, grocery stores, and pharmacies in under-served neighborhoods, and we’re already fighting an uphill battle to fill the exorbitantly high vacancies left by the COVID-19 pandemic in commercial corridors across the city. Businesses cannot withstand the ever-growing financial burden forced upon them with punitive policies including restrictive scheduling, the elimination of tip credits, and efforts to quadruple the real estate transfer tax. The addition of this paid leave policy all but guarantees we will lose that battle.\n\nWith Chicago on the verge of adopting the most complicated and expensive form of paid leave in the country, businesses of every size and sector will be left with no choice but to take their operations – and employees – elsewhere.\n\nAdditional Press Coverage:\n\nCrain’s Chicago: https://www.chicagobusiness.com/politics/pto-policy-heads-chicago-city-council-final-vote\n\nWTTW: https://news.wttw.com/2023/11/02/chicago-workers-get-10-days-paid-time-under-revised-measure-set-final-vote\n\nCBS News: https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-paid-leave-ordinance-workforce-committee-vote/\n\nChicago Tribune: https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-paid-leave-workforce-committee-vote-20231102-aq2m7bzllfc27j6tuuwny2q3ba-story.html\n\nChicago Sun Times: https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/11/2/23943393/paid-leave-ordinance-committee-vote-chicago-restaurants-sick-days-time-off'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://chicagocrusader.com/illinois-gets-7-million-for-unemployment-system-upgrades-as-debt-persists/', 'Headline': 'Illinois gets $7 million for unemployment system ... - The Chicago Crusader', 'Snippet': 'Illinois Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Todd Maisch is concerned about the tax burden placed on businesses because of ongoing unemployment debt, which at one point was $4.5 billion.', 'Full_text': 'As Illinois receives a nearly $7 million federal grant to better understand and address unemployment insurance system equity gaps, some continue to express concerns about persistent unemployment debt.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor in September awarded Illinois a $6.8 million million equity grant to better understand and address equity gaps within the Illinois unemployment insurance system.\n\nFour major equity projects will be funded through the grant, according to a news release by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. These projects include upgrading the UI service delivery systems, processes and communications for easier access and experience. This involves making the UI information easier to understand, translating the information into various languages, growing the self-service digital options and increasing the outreach to organizations within the community.\n\n“Since 2019, Governor Pritzker’s administration has supported IDES in its efforts to improve services to individuals with limited English proficiency and other barriers to access,” IDES director Kristin Richards said in the statement. “The work continues, and this grant opportunity will allow IDES to develop the data necessary to make targeted investments to promote equity in our state’s UI system and ensure eligible individuals have access to benefits.”\n\nIllinois is one of 27 states to get a share of more than $150 million of federal taxpayer funded grants for the program.\n\nRichards and IDES have been criticized by members of the Illinois legislature for not providing adequate information about unemployment benefits paid out fraudulently.

Millions of Americans benefited from pandemic relief payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and bolstered social programs.\n\nThese support mechanisms provided necessary help to many families during difficult times, but these same programs can discourage Americans from joining or rejoining the workforce—especially when increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits.\n\nAs businesses continue to grapple with a national workforce shortage, a flawed government benefits framework is one of many factors keeping Americans on the sidelines of the labor force.\n\nThis page dives deep into the effect pandemic benefits had on Americans\' financial wellness and unintended “benefit cliffs,” the point at which benefits are cut off, which can discourage labor market participation.\n\nThe impact of enhanced unemployment benefits\n\nDuring the pandemic, more than 20 million Americans received unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. From March 2020 to September 2021, the federal government provided an additional $300 - $600 a week to any person who was earning at least $1 in UI benefits.\n\nThe enhanced UI benefits were generous compared to regular UI benefits. On average, UI typically replaces 38% of a claimant’s average weekly wage.\n\nThe enhancement meant that most individuals were earning more on unemployment than they were while working, boosting Americans’ savings accounts, and deterring many from returning to work.\n\n24%\n\nThose who say government aid packages during the pandemic incentivized them to not actively look for work\n\n21%\n\nThose who say they never expect to be back to work full time\n\nSource: U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nEnhanced unemployment insurance and pandemic relief checks helped facilitate historic savings during the pandemic—as did the limited options for spending those savings as many normal spending options were unavailable, or significantly limited. Although those savings are coming down, in total, Americans saved about $2.7 trillion during the pandemic, 10% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nHistorically, layoffs and health emergencies stress Americans’ bank accounts and unemployed workers are eager to return to a steady paycheck. But during the pandemic, savings accounts broke with tradition and rose to unprecedented levels.\n\n$2.7 trillion\n\nThe amount Americans saved during pandemic, equal to 10% of the nation’s GDP\n\nDespite savings dwindling, labor force participation has not gone up\n\nMany Americans were able to live off the money they’d put aside, postponing a return to work. Now, more than a year out from pandemic checks and enhanced benefits, Americans are seeing their saving account dwindle with prices rising and spending on necessities resuming. But despite savings levels coming down, there has not been a substantial increase in the nation’s labor force participation.\n\nThe labor force participation rate still lags around one percentage point below where it was at the start of the pandemic, meaning nearly three million workers are still missing from the workforce.\n\nAlthough there are other barriers keeping Americans out of work, like access to childcare, navigating the loss of government benefits when earnings or savings increase is a contributing factor keeping Americans out of work right now.\n\nNavigating a loss in government benefits\n\nMost states provide 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. During that time, unemployed individuals are required to look for suitable employment and are often matched with reemployment services. Not all claimants find work by the time their UI benefits end, however. In these cases, additional government programs become critical.\n\nState and federal government benefit programs are available to assuage some difficult financial situations for low-income families and individuals. Benefits are administered at the state and federal level and most often are targeted toward a certain expense—food, care, and housing.\n\nA majority (70%) of public benefits go to non-elderly people who work, and more than half of all workers in the bottom 20% of the wage distribution receive public benefits.\n\n41 million\n\nPeople receiving SNAP benefits in 2021\n\n1 million\n\nFamilies receiving TANF benefits in 2020\n\n80.5 million\n\nPeople enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in 2021\n\n2.2 million+\n\nFamilies receiving housing choice vouchers in 2021\n\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; County Health Executives Association of California; The Pew Charitable Trusts\n\nWhile many programs operate on a sliding scale, gradually phasing out as income rises (like SNAP benefits), some programs are terminated at the onset of increased earnings or accrued savings.\n\n$10,326\n\nAnnual value of Medicaid benefits when earned income reaches $11,000\n\n$7,552\n\nValue loss of annual SNAP benefits when income reaches $35,000\n\nThe sliding scale and income thresholds lead to what is known as the “benefits cliff”—the point at which benefits are cut off. In some situations, the increased earnings do not make up for the loss in benefits. For this reason, some recipients are deterred from obtaining employment, working additional hours, or pursuing promotions and career development.\n\nThe two charts below from a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation describe the effect and severity of benefit cliffs.\n\nTake for example, public assistance in Durham County, North Carolina. Bundled public benefits decrease as earnings increase. However, if wages increase from $11,000 to $27,000 the family will experience a gap in health coverage between Medicaid and American Care Act subsidies because North Carolina is a non-expansion state for Medicaid.\n\n""Qualitative research reveals important insights about how employees navigate benefits cliffs,"" says Mathieu Despard, Ph.D., MSW. ""A 2016 study of benefit recipients in Cincinnati found that none of the recipients made a job or career decision based on impending benefits cliffs. Instead, these workers said they needed help in making the transition from public benefits to wage gains, such as budgeting for food amidst a loss in SNAP benefits, and that they felt worse off financially despite wage gains. Though workers preferred not to receive public benefits, they felt unprepared in losing these benefits.""\n\nA current snapshot of American’s financial wellness\n\nThe impact of benefits cliffs are especially relevant when considering the current financial wellness of Americans. With prices rising and pandemic savings dwindling, navigating benefits is more important than ever.\n\nDebt levels are beginning to rise again\n\nDebt levels declined during the pandemic, especially credit card debt. The drop in debt and rise in savings put consumers’ personal balance sheets in a strong position. However, debt levels are starting to rise as prices rise because of high inflation, the end of government pandemic benefits, and an increase in spending now that pandemic restrictions are mostly over.\n\nFurther, many did not pay their rent or mortgages during the pandemic. That moratorium is over which means they now need to make these large payments. With savings accounts no longer growing, prices rising, and spending on necessities resuming, Americans will see rising levels of debt as interest rates are climbing.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, overall debt levels have increased by 5.4%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Credit card debt, however, decreased during the same timeframe. In 2021, Americans acquired mortgages, car payments, and personal loans while paying down credit cards.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that a majority (61%) of American consumers are living paycheck to paycheck. While this standard financial lifestyle is most common among those who earn the least, living paycheck to paycheck exists across all income levels. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are precariously close to financial distress should an emergency occur.\n\n61%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\n\n79.9%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn less than $50k\n\n63.8%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn $50k-$100k\n\n42.2%\n\nPercentage of consumers living paycheck to paycheck that earn more than $100k\n\nA proper social net should encourage and enable labor market entry, financial stability, and economic mobility. However, the steep benefit cliffs discourage labor market participation and promotion.\n\nChanging the current framework would allow employers to fill open jobs and maximize productivity while also ensuring beneficiaries can reach self-sufficiency, build assets, and increase net worth. Policy changes that help achieve this balance include raising income limits, phasing out benefits more gradually, implementing continuous enrollment and transitional benefits, and eliminating asset tests.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/on-demand/economy/how-the-government-and-communities-can-address-ongoing-business-issues', 'Headline': 'State of American Business Chicago: What Government Can Do to Address ...', 'Snippet': 'During opening remarks at the State of American Business Chicago Summit, Jim Kirk, Group Publisher and Executive Editor at Crain’s Chicago Business, spoke with Suzanne P.

We have members in Illinois that represent 18 industries and half a billion dollars in revenue.”\n\nAdditionally, on the small business side, she continued, there are record business startups in Chicago and in Illinois as a whole.\n\n“I came here to see that, to feel the energy, to see the innovation and what you're all building, and to learn what we can do to be more helpful,” she said.\n\nEncouraging Competition Will Help the Business Community Solve Ongoing Issues\n\nAccording to Clark, “competition's at the heart of free enterprise” — and encouraging competition is healthy for the economy.\n\n“It's really at the heart of democracy and the founding of our country,” she said. “I love to meet entrepreneurs who say, ‘I have an idea.

We can find the solutions, we can find the answers through the spirit of competition.”\n\nThe Government Must Step Up To Address Crime and Public Safety\n\nChicago is especially facing pitfalls due to crime, with more than 50% of small businesses falling victim to shoplifting in 2022, according to Clark. As a result, 46% of those small businesses have raised their prices.\n\n“No American family needs anything more inflationary right now,” Clark said. “This is a real problem for families, communities, and businesses.”\n\nHowever, more concerning is the “inability to keep their employees and customers safe, and we're hearing about it nationwide,” she continued. “[We need] better prosecutors prosecuting crime, harsher criminal penalties, lower thresholds for a felony, and [a safer] online marketplace for sellers.”\n\n“There is a really serious role for government,” Clark added. “We want to be safe [and] there are really important roles for the government to be playing, and when they try to do everything, they stop doing the things they really need to do.”\n\nClark added that addressing government overreach isn't simple.\n\n“We need the government to do the really specific things we need them to do, and I think public safety's at the top of that list,” she said.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://newschannel20.com/news/local/new-data-shows-illinois-has-a-higher-unemployment-rate-than-national-average', 'Headline': 'New data shows Illinois has a higher unemployment rate than ... - WICS', 'Snippet': 'The national average unemployment rate is at 3.5%.

Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://reason.com/2022/01/04/ashli-babbitts-violent-past-doesnt-justify-her-death/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's Violent Past Doesn't Justify Her Death - Reason.com"", 'Snippet': 'Ashli Babbitt\'s Violent Past Doesn\'t Justify Her Death.

In the face of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to make Babbitt into a martyr, the article purports to provide a counter-narrative, that she was actually ""far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.""\n\nWhile that is certainly true, it is also beside the point: Babbitt\'s behavior on January 6 is sufficient by itself to demonstrate that she is not worthy of martyr status. Digging up prurient stories from Babbitt\'s past with no real news value is both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe article details a yearslong affair that Babbitt engaged in with a male coworker while she was married and he had a longtime girlfriend, Celeste Norris (Babbitt and the man in question, Aaron Babbitt, later married after separating from their respective partners). Babbitt confronted Norris in traffic by ramming her car, then getting out and screaming through the locked doors. Norris later sought, and received, multiple restraining orders against Babbitt.\n\nWhile the story may be salacious, it has no bearing on the events that led to Babbitt\'s death. In fact, the events of that day are sufficient to determine that she was not the righteous figure that the former president and his supporters are making her out to be. Babbitt was among hundreds of people who swarmed into the Capitol, breaking windows and kicking in doors to do so. She was part of a group actively attempting to break through a door leading to the Speaker\'s Lobby while lawmakers were still being evacuated. Facing Capitol Police officers, Babbitt attempted to climb through a hole in the broken door, at which point an officer fired, fatally wounding her.\n\nBabbitt\'s behavior in the immediate lead-up to her death was condemnable. But to report out completely unrelated events from her past is shameful on its own.\n\nIn fact, the posthumous attempt to recontextualize Babbitt resembles the reverse hagiographies sometimes penned about black victims of police violence. In 2015, after Sandra Bland was found dead in a jail cell under suspicious circumstances, after initially being arrested for not putting out her cigarette during a traffic stop, the district attorney averred that Bland was ""not a model person."" A year earlier, after Michael Brown was killed during an interaction with a Ferguson police officer, The New York Times described him as ""no angel."" And ever since George Floyd\'s May 2020 murder at the hands of Derek Chauvin, some on the right have continued to insist that Floyd actually died of a fentanyl overdose, and was therefore ""not an angel"" but a ""drug addict.""\n\nAll of those reactions were rightly condemned at the time: Even if the allegations were correct—that Bland was combative, that Brown had a violent history, that Floyd was a drug addict—that would not change the facts of the individual cases, in which police acted wrongly and used excessive force, resulting in these victims\' deaths.\n\nWe should condemn this media tactic when applied to black men and women killed by police, and we should condemn it in Babbitt\'s case, too.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/27/ashli-babbitt-mother-ag-declines-charges/11133650002/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mother won't face charges after Jan 6 arrest - USA TODAY"", 'Snippet': '1:27.

After Babbitt’s fatal shooting, a Capitol Police investigation cleared the officer who pulled the trigger of wrongdoing and commended him for protecting the Capitol.\n\n“The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away,” U.S. Capitol Police wrote in a statement nearly two years ago. “USCP Officers had barricaded the Speaker’s Lobby with furniture before a rioter shattered the glass door. If the doors were breached, the rioters would have immediate access to the House Chambers. The officer’s actions were consistent with the officer’s training and USCP policies and procedures.”\n\nWhen that investigation concluded in August 2021, authorities had not released the name of the officer who pulled the trigger, citing “numerous credible and specific threats” against him. His name had been leaked to far-right websites, and the lieutenant, who is Black, was barraged with racist abuse. He later went public and identified himself as Lt. Michael Byrd.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.wavy.com/news/national/mother-of-capitol-rioter-shot-killed-on-jan-6-arrested-at-demonstration-in-dc-two-years-later/', 'Headline': 'Mother of Capitol rioter shot, killed on Jan.6 arrested at ...', 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — Two years after a U.S. Capitol police officer shot and killed Ashli Babbitt, a woman who was part of the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, police arrested her mother.', 'Full_text': ''}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/kevin-mccarthy-met-ashli-babbitts-mom-ahead-gop-visit-jan-6-prisoners-rcna76419', 'Headline': ""Kevin McCarthy met Ashli Babbitt's mom ahead of GOP visit ... - NBC News"", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met Thursday with the mother of Ashli Babbitt, the Jan. 6 rioter shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer, one month after McCarthy said he believed ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON — House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met Thursday with the mother of Ashli Babbitt, the Jan. 6 rioter shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer, one month after McCarthy said he believed the officer ""did his job"" when he shot her as she jumped through a broken window while members of Congress fled.\n\nNBC News first learned about McCarthy\'s meeting with Micki Witthoeft on Thursday morning, and McCarthy, R-Calif., confirmed that Witthoeft had requested it.\n\nWitthoeft said the meeting went well. She said they discussed McCarthy\'s previous comments about Babbitt\'s death, but she did not go into detail about what he said.\n\n""I felt like it was a good meeting,"" Witthoeft said. ""I thought Speaker McCarthy was delightful.""\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has criticized McCarthy for his comments about the officer who ""shot and killed Great Patriot Ashli Babbitt."" The Justice Department did not press charges against the officer, finding there was no evidence to contradict his belief that it was necessary to shoot Babbitt ""in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.""\n\nThe officer, Lt. Michael Byrd, was exonerated in an internal Capitol Police investigation. His attorney said Byrd ""saved lives and helped to end the violent insurrection.""\n\nByrd said in an interview with Lester Holt in August 2021: “If they get through that door, they’re into the House chamber and upon the members of Congress. I know that day I saved countless lives. I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nWitthoeft and McCarthy met a day before several Republican members of Congress plan to visit the Washington, D.C., jail, where a limited number of people charged with being Capitol rioters who have been deemed dangers to the community or who have refused to obey conditions of release are being held.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and other Republican representatives have pressed for information about the ""January 6 detainees"" in the jail. All of the Jan. 6 defendants at the jail have had their cases individually assessed by judges and, in many cases, an appeals court, which has determined that pretrial detention is necessary.\n\nThe people who had been held before trial included rioters like Daniel Rodriguez, who drove a stun gun into the neck of former Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone, and Samuel Lazar, who is seen on video using a bullhorn to urge rioters to steal police officers\' guns.\n\nAn analysis on Just Security showed that the Washington Corrections Department is holding just 20 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack out of about 1,000 people who have been arrested. Nine of the 20 have been convicted or have pleaded guilty.\n\nThere are just three defendants at the jail who are not charged with physically assaulting law enforcement officers on Jan. 6, 2021. One of them, William Chrestman, a member of the Proud Boys, is being held because a judge determined there was overwhelming evidence in support of the case against him and that he is a flight risk.\n\nAnother is Jessica Watkins, who was convicted at the first Oath Keepers trial and admitted on the stand that she joined a push against law enforcement after having invaded the Capitol in military gear. Watkins called herself an ""idiot"" and apologized to the officers on the other side of the line, who she said were protecting others from ""my dumb ass.""\n\n""In hindsight, I feel like I was gullible,"" Watkins said on the stand. ""I got a steady diet of Infowars and Alex Jones."" She compared Jan. 6 to Black Friday, with everyone trying to get in the doors at the same time.\n\nLast, there is Eric Christie. As NBC News first reported in December, Christie got into an hourslong standoff with law enforcement when they went to arrest him. Images of Christie outside the Capitol on Jan. 6 show a hammer hanging from his belt, and the Justice Department said he held on to a baseball another rioter had stolen from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office.'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s ... - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'That is how Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, described the way Donald Trump talks about her daughter, who died one year ago today on 6 January, 2021, while trying to ...', 'Full_text': '“Every time he talks about her, he says her name. He could say ‘her’ or ‘she; or whatever.

She was part of a crowd of Trump supporters that had stormed the seat of the US Senate to stop it ratifying the election result, with some allegedly planning to do so by armed force.\n\nIn a less polarised era, American politicians in both parties might have rallied around the officer who shot her. Today, though, she has become a martyr to many of Mr Trump’s followers, praised and venerated by a movement that is increasingly willing to endorse political violence to keep its opponents out of power.\n\nRepublican members of congress including Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida have taken up her cause, as have Fox News, the pro-Trump TV station Newsmax and even Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne right-wing group, Look Ahead America, has called for a vigil in Babbitt’s name for those in prison awaiting trial for their alleged actions on 6 January. Donations to a ""Justice for Ashli Babbitt legal fund"" continue to pour in, with more than $378,000 (£278,500) raised as of Wednesday.\n\nFollow live updates on the January 6 anniversary\n\nMr Trump himself has been her cheerleader in chief, referring to her death as a murder. and offering her family his ""unwavering"" support"". ""To Ashli’s family and friends, please know that her memory will live on in our hearts for all time,"" he said in a video specially filmed for her birthday on 10 October. ""There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli.""\n\nTerrorism experts and anti-racist groups find the former president’s intervention deeply disturbing, comparing it to the way Islamic fundamentalists and the Nazi Party in the 1940s used manufactured martyrs to inspire further acts of violence.\n\nFor Cara Castronuova, a pro-Trump activist who co-founded the group Citizens Against Political Persecution to advocate for alleged January 6 rioters, it is a vindication of many months fighting to reframe the storming of the Capitol as a peaceful protest and its alleged invaders as political prisoners.\n\n""At first her name was taboo, even in conservative media,"" Ms Castronuova tells The Independent. ""Nobody would talk about her, nobody would mention her, nobody would mention anybody’s name from 6 January. There was a three to four month block of time at the beginning of 2020... and then it just snowballed.""\n\nWho was Ashli Babbitt?\n\nWhen Ashli Babbitt quit the US military in 2016, she left at the rank of senior airman with 12 years of service and eight deployments behind her. Having enlisted in the US Air Force (USAF) straight out of high school in 2003, she protected bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, protected USAF bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Katar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAt one point, she had even guarded the seat of the US government, serving in an Air National Guard unit known as the ""Capital Guardians"" at a base near Washington DC. In 2013, she was part of the DC Air National Guard’s security detail for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nBabbitt grew up in Lakeside, California, not far from San Diego, the oldest sister to four younger brothers. One former classmate told Insider that she was ""disruptive"" in class, highly opinionated and always trying to be ""one of the guys"".\n\nThat bolshy nature survived throughout her service, with former comrades saying she struggled to be promoted and was demoted at least once due to spats with superiors. One friend described her as ""small but mighty"" (Babbitt was 5 feet 2 inches tall), unafraid to contradict her officers when she disagreed.\n\n""Ashli was headstrong and impulsive,"" said Sgt Eirik Blackwolf, who served with her in the DC Air National Guard. ""She didn’t hold back on her opinion to anyone, no matter their rank, especially if she thought they were wrong or behaving unethically.""\n\nDuring one deployment Babbitt was injured in a mortar strike that knocked her onto a pile of debris. Augustine Luna, a close friend, told Insider that the impact damaged Babbitt’s uterus and left her unable to bear children, but that Babbitt rarely mentioned this.\n\nIn 2015 Babbitt began working as a private security guard for a nuclear power plant in Maryland, where she met her future second husband Aaron Babbitt. That was also the year Mr Babbitt’s then-girlfriend Celeste Norris first encountered Ashli.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ms Norris said Mr Babbitt at first described the new girl as ""this foul-mouthed chick that’s on shift"". Later, Ms Norris found out the two were dating, and broke up with Mr Babbitt.\n\nThe next year, Ms Norris said, she was waiting at a stop sign when a white SUV barged through nearby traffic and repeatedly rammed into her car. When they stopped, Babbitt got out and began hammering with her hand on the window. ""It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was,"" said Ms Norris. ""Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.""\n\nA court acquitted Babbitt of criminal charges, but Ms Norris secured a restraining order against her, and later mounted a personal injury lawsuit that Babbitt settled out of court. In court documents from 2017, Ms Norris wrote that Babbitt had continued to follow her home from work and harass her. ""I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,"" she told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Babbitt moved to San Diego to help buy out and run a swimming pool supply company where her brothers, her uncle and her husband all worked together. ""It was kind of nice, a family affair,"" her brother Roger said.\n\nBabbitt and her husband became daily customers at a brewery near the San Diego sea front, often with their three ex-military dogs in tow. According to brewery owner Jim Millea, the pair had a polyamorous relationship with one of his bartenders. Babbitt herself often arrived fuming about a political issue that had grabbed her attention.\n\nYet the pool supply business quickly got into trouble. Babbitt took out a short term business loan with a steep interest rate and was sued by the lender for failing to make payments, ultimately being ordered by a judge to pay it all back. In 2019, she sold the house where her parents had lived for nearly 20 years, reportedly making them feel ""kicked out of their own home"".\n\nBy this time, Babbitt was a staunch Trump supporter and an opponent of lockdown measures. Her company’s office bore a sign reading: ""Mask-free autonomous zone, better known As America"".\n\nHer brother told the New York Times that she had felt free after leaving the military, and had been angry with the number of homeless people in San Diego and the challenges for small business owners.\n\nOne customer told CBS 8 San Diego that he dropped Babbitt’s company after she went on an unprovoked political rant. “She just started talking about people who oppose Trump and about Nancy Pelosi and [Chuck] Schumer and homeless people,"" the customer said. ""A lot of it didn’t even make any sense. It literally went on for about a minute and a half... it was shocking that she would be talking to a customer the way she was talking to me.""\n\nEven so, Babbitt’s death inside the US Capitol was a shock to her parents. ""I don’t really know why she decided to do this,"" her mother-in-law toldFox 5 Washington DC last year.\n\nHer social media accounts, however, told an all too familiar story.\n\n‘Nothing will stop us’\n\nOn 7 September, 2020, tweeting under the username @CommonSenseAsh, Ashli Babbitt posted a photo of herself smiling in sunglasses and a black tank top, posing in front of an old-fashioned boat in the harbour of San Diego.\n\nTo many the photo might have looked innocuous, a happy selfie from a nice day out. But her shirt bore the slogan ""We are Q"" – a reference to the anonymous purported government insider who inspired the cult-like millenarian movement known as QAnon.\n\nFor almost a year, Babbitt had been posting in support of QAnon, which believes Mr Trump’s Democratic opponents are part of a global Satanist paedophile ring. Adherents think Mr Trump himself is the figurehead for a secret plot by ""white hats"" (ie, good guys) to sweep the Satanists from power in a military coup, resulting in mass imprisonment or execution.\n\nThe movement has been tied to violent acts including murders, kidnappings, terror plots, attempted bombings, and vehicular attacks, as well as campaigns of online harassment and death threats.\n\nBabbitt’s radical shift came gradually. Back in 2018, she had told another user that she had voted for Barack Obama and still believed he had done ""great things"", but had turned to Mr Trump because she could not stomach Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Ms Luna, Babbitt had voted for Trump in 2016 because he was not a career politician, but soon began calling Democrats ""commies"" and skirmished aggressively offline and online with anyone who disputed her anti-mask beliefs.\n\nIn November 2019, she tweeted about Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that went viral among Trump supporters in 2016 and was a key precursor to QAnon. Online activists had fixated on chance words in hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders as evidence of a secret child sex dungeon beneath a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. Later one of them stormed the restaurant with a rifle to rescue the supposed children, but found nothing.\n\nIn February 2020, Babbitt tweeted her first of many QAnon slogans. Most often she retweeted QAnon influencers such as the lawyer Lin Wood. Ms Luna told Insider that Babbitt was drawn in by the idea that children were in danger, spending hours every week reading about missing kids and appalled that QAnon’s claims were not being taken seriously in the mainstream media.\n\nAccording to Prof Mia Bloom, a terrorism researcher at Georgia University, QAnon’s appeals to ""save the children"" are ""almost verbatim"" how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) recruited three British schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, London, in 2015.\n\n""This kind of message that builds upon someone’s innate goodness is a very different pathway into terrorism than we ordinarily think,"" says Prof Bloom. ""We assume that it’s about hatred, it’s about violence, it’s about racism and white supremacy on the Right and jihadi ideology for [Islamic] groups, when in fact a lot of the pull factors can be based in what we would consider to be very positive attributes.""\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Babbitt did not accept the results of the 2020 election and plunged wholeheartedly into the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. On 1 January, 2021, Babbitt tweeted that she would be in Washington DC on the 6th for a rally addressed by Mr Trump.\n\nOn 5 January, she boarded a plane in San Diego and texted to her friend that there were ""tons of Trump supporters"" flying with her. Another user tweeted that some flights to DC were being cancelled, supposedly to prevent people from attending the 6 January rally.\n\nBabbitt replied: ""Nothing will stop us. They can try and try and try, but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.""\n\nWhen Trump’s army stormed the Capitol, Ashli Babbitt was among the mob that gathered in a stairwell near the chamber of the House of Representatives, where up to 80 members of congress and staff were sheltering. She was wearing a Trump flag on her shoulders like a cape.\n\nThe crowd began hammering on the doors out of the stairwell, which were barricaded from the other side with furniture. One window broke, and Ashli Babbitt, who was unarmed, climbed through. A gunshot rang out, and she fell back with a bullet in her shoulder.\n\nPro-Trump activists have found their George Floyd\n\nLast August, the police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt finally broke his silence. For months Lt Michael Byrd, who is black, had been in hiding due to repeated death threats and racist attacks after Mr Trump falsely claimed he worked for a ""high-ranking"" Democratic politician.\n\n""I know that day I saved countless lives,"" Lt Byrd told NBC News. “I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job.”\n\nBabbitt did not become a Trumpist hero overnight. The day after the riot, Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin, who saw Babbitt’s death, said that Lt Byrd had not had any choice. ""The mob was going to come through the door,"" he told ABC. ""There was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many Trump supporters believed she was a plant or a stooge, put into the crowd by the FBI or other dark forces. In April, the US Department of Justice closed its investigation with no criminal charges.\n\nBy the time of Lt Byrd’s interview, however, Babbitt’s name had become a clarion call in what Ms Castronuova calls the conservative ""underground"" of alternative media and social media. Ms Castronuova was among the first people to interview Babbitt’s family on InfoWars, a fringe news site that often promotes conspiracy theories and has been banned from most major social networks for hate speech.\n\n""[Trump] is really in tune with the community, his base,"" Ms Castronuova says. ""The underground will start to buzz, then Donald Trump picks up on it."" Soon enough, at rallies and in interviews last summer, Mr Trump was calling Babbitt ""an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman"", someone who was on his ""side"", and said there was ""no reason for"" her to die. Ms Castronuova says his backing was ""instrumental"".\n\nMr Trump’s efforts increased after a personal phone call to Mrs Witthoeft, who had become politically active. She has now spoken at a Trump rally and has backed her daughter’s actions, saying: ""She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.""\n\nMs Castronuova says: ""[Babbitt’s] mother has been really instrumental too. She became quite an advocate. She was afraid to speak out at first... but when she finally started speaking out, things really started to change.""\n\nBabbitt’s family sued the District of Columbia to uncover Lt Byrd’s identity, and plans to file wrongful death lawsuits against Lt Byrd himself and the Capitol Police. Terrell Roberts III, a lawyer for Babbitt’s husband Aaron, declined to comment and declined an interview on Mr Babbitt’s behalf.\n\nDonations to Mr Babbitt’s legal fund continue to roll in, with many donors identifying themselves as military veterans. Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating Democratic secrets.\n\nMany Trump supporters have compared Babbitt to George Floyd, a black man murdered by police in Minnesota, lifting the Black Lives Matter slogan ""say her name"" used in reference to many victims of police brutality.\n\nOn the private messaging app Telegram, which is popular on the far right, pro-Trump channels frequently invoke Babbitt’s name, sharing news articles about her family’s lawsuit or claiming that she was set up by informants. Many asked the question ""who killed Ashli Babbit?"" which Mr Trump later echoed.\n\n""The entire scenario looks to be staged. So who is the rotting fish head of what appears to be a deliberate false flag? Who or what group set this up?"" said the evangelist channel Veteran Patriots. The Proud Boys, a fascist militia, have begun using a stylised image of Babbitt as a logo, with the slogan: ""They can’t kill us all.""\n\nBritish radicals have also taken up her cause. ""Her name was Ashli Babbitt,"" said British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. ""She was murdered by the state and her name was dragged through the mud by the media."" An account identifying itself as former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has invoked her name several times.\n\nSome appear to believe she is not even dead. ""Ashli Babbitt false [is a] flag, she’s alive living underground,"" said a QAnon channel called Gitmo TV.\n\n‘A weapon of mass radicalisation’\n\nTo Prof Bloom, Babbitt’s transformation into an innocent victim of Leftist injustice has a worrying historical echo: Horst Wessel, the young Nazi street-fighter who was turned into a symbol of fascist heroism by Josef Goebbel’s propaganda apparatus.\n\nWessel was shot in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party, probably as part of a dispute over unpaid rent with his Communist landlady. By 1936, after the Nazis took power, official media referred to him as greater than Jesus Christ and the Horst Wessel Song was Germany’s joint national anthem.\n\n""Fake martyrdoms succeed because they feed off the shared grievances and anger of the crowd, serving as justification for future retaliatory violence,"" wrote Prof Bloom and another researcher, Sophia Moskalenko, with whom Prof Bloom has co-authored a book about QAnon. ""Ashli Babbitt’s unfortunate death is a weapon of mass radicalisation, just like Horst Wessel’s death was manipulated by Goebbels.""\n\nIndeed, the Nazis’ modern successors have particularly embraced Babbitt, turning an enthusiastic Trump supporter with a chequered past who was killed in a chaotic riot into a towering hero or innocent victim of police brutality while seeking to pin the blame on black and Jewish people.\n\n""Unlike ‘Saint Floyd’, Ashli Babbitt will receive no justice from this sick anti-white system,"" said one white supremacist Telegram channel. ""But we will always remember her sacrifice and she will never be forgotten. There is a day coming not far from now when we will erect statues in her honor.""\n\nThe same channel referred to Lt Byrd as a ""black parasite who gets to kill an unarmed white woman and walk around unbothered"", threatening to make him ""account for his actions"". Another neo-Nazi channel claimed that ""Ashli Babbitt was killed because she was white"".\n\nAlex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates against antisemitism and other forms of racism, says such messages are part of a widespread effort by white supremacists to lure recruits from the broader pro-Trump community.\n\n""White supremacists will always try to twist whatever major story is in the news to fit their agenda,"" says Mr Friedfeld. It’s unclear how successful these efforts have been, but the fact that they are trying to leverage the Babbitt story is deeply concerning because it raises the likelihood that someone is radicalised.""\n\nProf Bloom agrees, comparing it to the Proud Boys’ attempts last summer to recruit ""incel"" anti-feminists. She says that while many QAnon believers are not consciously racist, and not all are white, the movement has a pervasive racial bias, with trafficked children usually depicted as white whereas real world child trafficking disproportionately affects children of colour.\n\nProf Bloom also points out that another protester, Rosanne Boyland, died during the riot but has not been turned into a martyr in the same way. The reason, she argues, is that unlike Babbitt’s family, the Boyland’s have blamed Mr Trump for their loved one’s death.\n\nA threat from within America’s military\n\nThe martyrdom of Ashli Babbitt paints a foreboding picture of where American politics is going. To Prof Bloom and Prof Moskalenko, martyrs are a ubiquitous manufactured product of radical movements, useful because of their potency in rallying followers to stay in the fight and seek revenge against the enemy.\n\nMs Castronuova stops short of saying Babbitt was an example others should follow, describing her as a good person sucked into an ""emotionally charged"" and chaotic situation. She is happy to call Babbitt a martyr, claiming: ""She was killed because of her political beliefs, and they continue to kill her image and her memory because of her political beliefs. If she was a liberal and she hated Donald Trump, she would be remembered very fondly by the media.""\n\nMr Friedfelder, however, fears that Babbitt’s lionisation could contribute to an escalating cycle of conflict, and considers politicians’ embrace of Babbitt to be dangerous. While most Republicans have not embraced the idea that she was unjustly killed, few have publicly rebuked it, apparently reluctant to openly challenge Mr Trump even now he is out of office.\n\nThat does not mean they are happy behind the scenes. On Wednesday Mr Trump cancelled a press conference on the anniversary of the riot, reportedly under pressure from mainstream Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said he had played golf with Mr Trump at the weekend and warned him that there ""could be peril"" in such an event. Still, history suggests that Mr Trump’s concessions to moderates are rarely permanent.\n\nMr Friedfelder says: ""Her martyrdom turns her into a call to action... it is one thing for extremists to embrace Babbitt, but it is another for the former president and several high-profile members of the Republican Party to do the same. These officials are supposed to be trusted figures and people look to them for guidance when trying to understand national events.""\n\nClaims that Babbitt was murdered or assassinated continue to spread on social media, according to data from the online discussion tracking firm Zignal Labs. Mr Trump’s and Mr Putin’s comments caused spikes in mentions of Babbitt, and the general discussion around 6 January has barely waned over the past year.\n\nProf Bloom believes there is a more acute threat too: Babbitt’s military record. According to a report from START, an academic coalition that studies terrorism, at least 118 of the 719 people charged in connection with the riot, about 16 per cent of the whole, are veterans. In a START extremism database, about 7 per cent of all far-right cases had military experience, with the rest simply listed as unknown.\n\n""We don’t know how many American military [members] have been radicalised, either by MAGA or specifically by QAnon and white supremacy,"" says Prof Bloom. ""There has been a problem of white supremacy in the military for decades that the military has been reticent to deal with.\n\n""It’s dangerous because it’s not just some flunky who wants to make a name for themselves. It’s someone with military training who has weapons and knows how to use them."" She compares most pro-Trump extremists with the bumbling jihadists in 2010’s Four Lions, with lots of anger but limited ways to direct it. ""When you have someone who has been trained by the military or law enforcement, they know how to use that anger.""\n\nProf Moskalenko worries that the conditions are set for yet more political violence in America. ""A martyrdom is a symbol of perceived widespread injustice and suffering. There’s a lot of that going around,"" she says. ""With or without Ashli Babbit, we have problems. Addressing them, rather than getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of rhetoric, competing narratives, and shifting moral frames, is our only hope.""'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-03/ashli-babbitt-capitol-riot-killed-trump-martyr', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a martyr?

When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Md. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nBabbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed. The officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nHer husband, Aaron, declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris viewed her.\n\nCourt records involving the 2016 violent confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nNorris later got a judicial order that barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family.'}}",94.08333333333333,1

In a brief unsigned order without any noted dissents, the justices turned down an emergency filing from Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Warren Petersen, the president of the Arizona Senate.\n\nThe laws at the center of the dispute were enacted in 2022. They require would-be voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship or face penalties, such as a ban on voting in most elections or an outright bar on voting by mail. The Biden administration and other plaintiffs, including the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party, went to federal court to challenge the laws, arguing that they violated (among other things) the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and federal voting laws.\n\nToma and Petersen joined the case to defend the laws after the state’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, declined to do so in full. The challengers then sought discovery from them, including to depose them about the legislature’s intent in passing the laws. Toma and Petersen argued that an order requiring them to appear for a deposition would violate the legislative privilege – that is, the idea that legislators are shielded from both criminal and civil liability, as well as being compelled to answer questions or produce documents, regarding anything that is an integral part of the legislative process.\n\nThe district rejected that argument, ruling that Toma and Petersen had waived their privilege when they opted to join the case, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the depositions could go forward.\n\nToma and Petersen came to the Supreme Court on Nov. 20, asking the justices to put the depositions and discovery on hold to give them time to file a petition for a writ of mandamus – an order directing the lower court to reverse its order on the legislative privilege question. They told the justices that the district court’s “unprecedented ruling will chill both the atmosphere for all legislators to freely express their views during the legislative process and the ability and willingness of present and future legislative leaders to participate in litigation to defend the constitutionality of state laws.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party urged the justices to turn down the request. They emphasized that the discovery requests do not seek information about the legislators’ personal motives, but instead about the legislature’s intent, which “is a proper subject for discovery because plaintiffs’ claims in this litigation include that the challenged laws violate the Equal Protection Clause; one element of such a claim is discriminatory intent or purpose by the legislature.”\n\nAnd Toma and Petersen have other options besides a writ of mandamus, the Democrats argued. For example, they could decline to “comply with the discovery order and then appeal any resulting sanctions or contempt order.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rusty-bowers-arizona-election-results-david-farnsworth-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Rusty Bowers, Arizona House speaker who testified at Jan. 6 hearing ...', 'Snippet': ""The hearing focused on a plan by Trump's allies to put forward alternate electors that supported Trump in seven battleground states in the 2020 election that President Biden won, including Arizona."", 'Full_text': 'Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican who testified at a House Jan. 6 committee hearing about former President Donald Trump\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, lost his bid in Tuesday\'s GOP primary for a state Senate seat to a Trump-backed candidate, CBS News projects.\n\nFormer state Sen.

So he issued an order confirming the Arizona election, which Biden won with a 10,457-vote edge over Trump.\n\nFederal court case remains to be heard\n\nFriday’s ruling, however, is not the last word.\n\nWard, in anticipation of the case going against her, already had announced she plans to seek review by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAnd a separate lawsuit is playing out in federal court, which includes some of the same claims made here along with allegations of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThat case, set for a hearing Tuesday, also seeks to void the results of the presidential contest.\n\nIt includes allegations that the Dominion Software voting equipment used by Maricopa County is unreliable and was programmed to register more votes for Biden than he actually got.\n\nLegislative leaders call for audit but not to change election results\n\nAlong the same lines, Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday called for an independent audit of the software and equipment used by Maricopa County in the just-completed election.\n\n“There have been questions,” Fann said.\n\nBut she told Capitol Media Services it is not their intent to use whatever is found to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election.\n\nIn fact, she said nothing in the Republican legislative leaders’ request for the inquiry alleges there are any “irregularities” in the way the election was conducted.\n\n“At the very least, the confidence in our electoral system has been shaken because of a lot of claims and allegations,” Fann said. “So our No. 1 goal is to restore the confidence of our voters.”\n\nBowers specifically rejected calls by the Trump legal team that the Legislature come into session to void the election results, which were formally certified on Monday.\n\n“The rule of law forbids us to do that,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Bowers pointed out, it was the Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted a law three years ago specifically requiring the state’s electors “to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide canvass.”\n\nHe said that was done because Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote nationwide in 2016 and some lawmakers feared that electors would refuse to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Trump, who won Arizona’s race that year.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in a prepared statement. “But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/arizona-fake-electors-face-legal-130045420.html', 'Headline': 'Arizona fake electors face legal jeopardy, experts say - Yahoo', 'Snippet': 'GOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College.', 'Full_text': 'The people who falsely claimed to be Arizona\'s 2020 electors might not be named in the federal indictment of Donald Trump, but they still face serious legal peril, as do the people from Trump\'s team who directed them, some experts say.\n\nBut the legal debate over the issue has experts taking both sides, perhaps signaling that if an Arizona case develops, it won\'t be a slam dunk.\n\nGOP members in seven states where Joe Biden won the election, including Arizona, falsely signed documents in 2020 in an attempt to thwart the Electoral College. The federal indictment of Trump said this was part of a criminal conspiracy aimed at keeping him in office.\n\nThe Michigan electors were each charged with eight felonies and released on $1,000 bonds.\n\nAt least eight of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been offered immunity.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes\' office has said Arizona\'s electors are under investigation. The office declined further comment Friday.\n\nJoshua Stanton, counsel at Perry Law who is based in Washington, D.C., said that it’s not just the fake electors who face jeopardy, but those who might have misled those people before they signed the documents claiming to be the rightful electors.\n\n“There is significant evidence that a lot of these false electors it seems across the country were aware that Trump had definitely lost, that his litigation attempts were bogus, and that this was really being used as part of an effort, an illegal effort, to overturn the election,"" said Stanton, who clerked at U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n\nAt a previous firm he represented recording artists, professional athletes, actors and business executives.\n\nHe said prosecuting the electors might depend on what they were told by people working with Trump to overturn the election, and whether they thought they were only to be used if the elections in those states were overturned by the courts for some reason. They in fact were used even though court challenges to overturn the state elections all failed.\n\n“If the false electors, when they signed that form, honestly believed that (they would only be used if the GOP won in court), then it seems likely that they didn’t do anything wrong,” Stanton said. “It would be hard to actually prosecute them.”\n\nNone of the Arizona GOP representatives who signed false documents contacted by The Arizona Republic in recent months have agreed to talk on the record.\n\nStanton said it’s possible prosecutors already have evidence to show they knew the documents would be sent to Congress even if the courts didn\'t overturn the state elections. It appears the co-conspirators named in the indictment didn\'t plan to use the fake electors only as a contingency.\n\n“Even if the false electors themselves maybe potentially avoid liability, there are a number of people at the higher levels that could face charges in Arizona,” Stanton said.\n\nHe said that based on what is known publicly so far, charges could still come from the federal or state level for those people.\n\nThe indictment seems to offer an out to the false electors by stating they were misled by people trying to help Trump overturn the election.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the false electors who could end up getting indicted,"" Stanton said. ""It’s the folks who maybe misled them.""\n\nElection exodus: The exodus of Arizona election officials continues. This time, it\'s in ruby-red Mohave County\n\nStanton referenced emails from Arizona lawyer Jack Wilenchik, reported last year in The New York Times, including one in which Wilenchik referred to the electors as ""fake.""\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Wilenchik wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik later wrote that “alternative” was a better term than “fake.”\n\nWilenchik also wrote the idea that it could launch an objection in Congress to certifying the vote for Biden, and acknowledged that the electors\' votes should not count, according to another email reported by the Times.\n\n“His idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren’t legal under federal law — because they’re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,” Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, to Epshteyn and others, according to the Times.\n\nWilenchik told The Arizona Republic on Friday that in those emails he was only offering an opinion on the plan for Trump\'s campaign staff when asked, and he believed the actions were legal.\n\n""I believed then and I believe now it is completely legal, as do a number of legal scholars,"" Wilenchik said. ""There is no crime I can even conceive of here.""\n\nHe referenced recent comments from legal scholar Alan Dershowitz supporting the idea that submitting alternate electors is the proper way to protest an election.\n\nDershowitz, a nationally recognized constitutional lawyer, recently said during a FOX News appearance that submitting the alternate electors was the proper way to address state elections where the rightful winner is undecided.\n\n""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960,"" Dershowitz said, referencing the race in Hawaii that year between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.\n\nNixon was certified the winner by the state governor after prevailing by 140 votes that year, but a recount was underway the day electors met to cast votes. Electors for both candidates signed certificates and delivered them to Congress.\n\n""And a court in Hawaii said that\'s the right way to do it,"" continued Dershowitz, who was recently among a team of lawyers sanctioned for filing a meritless lawsuit on behalf of Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake that sought to force counties to hand count ballots.\n\nWilenchik said Dershowitz\'s comments support the move as legitimate, and he called the prosecution in Michigan ""bogus and political.""\n\n“What these people put on their certificates here in Arizona was just that we believe we are the duly elected electors. They didn’t say they were certified. They weren’t certified,"" Wilenchik continued. ""That is what I was pointing out in the email. Certified means the governor and secretary of state were signing off on it.”\n\nWilenchik said he did not mislead any of the people who signed the documents or tell them the documents would only be submitted if courts overturned Arizona’s election.\n\nExpert says state charges more likely than federal\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political sciences in the School of Global Politics and the Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law at ASU, said state charges are more likely than federal charges for the Arizona fake electors.\n\n“It may be that the federal government has concluded this is best left to the state attorneys general to prosecute,” she said.\n\nLindquist clerked for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia and practiced law at Latham and Watkins in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven setting aside the possibility of charging the electors with a criminal conspiracy, Arizona has a statute that criminalizes creating a public record ""knowing that it has been falsely made,"" that could apply to the document the electors sent to Congress, she said.\n\nIt doesn\'t help the Arizona fake electors that two states, Pennsylvania and New Mexico, offered conditional language in their documents stating they would only be valid if those state elections were overturned, while Arizona and the other states did not.\n\nThe federal indictment states that Trump’s allies wanted to prevent the other fake electors from using similar conditional language, which she said was improper on their part.\n\n“What a cynical, fraudulent thing to do to these dupes in the state legislatures,” she said. “It’s not that these people shouldn’t have known better. I think they should have. There’s no doubt they were manipulated by the conspirators.”\n\nIt’s possible the Justice Department intentionally let the electors off the hook so that it might secure testimony from those people to help prosecute Trump or the co-conspirators, she said.\n\nThe states where fake electors submitted documents were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona were: Tyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee; Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors; lawmaker Jake Hoffman; state senator Anthony Kern; Jim Lamon, a failed U.S. Senate candidate; Robert Montgomery of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead of the Gila County Republican Party; Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Kelli Ward, the state GOP chair at the time; and Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/post-misrepresents-legal-power-of-arizona-resolution-on-electronic-voting-machines/', 'Headline': 'Post Misrepresents Legal Power of Arizona Resolution on Electronic ...', 'Snippet': ""The Republican majority leader of the Arizona Senate informed county election officials that a Senate resolution essentially bars electronic voting systems in the state.

The state’s Democratic secretary of state and attorney general say the resolution carries no legal weight. Nonetheless, based on the resolution, a Facebook post misleadingly claimed the state “has banned electronic voting machines.”\n\nFull Story\n\nFalse claims about election fraud in Arizona have been circulating since the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump has made a series of false claims about fraudulent ballots and “massive … voting irregularities” in the state’s 2020 election, as we’ve written before. Those claims followed investigations and audits that confirmed Joe Biden won the state’s presidential election.\n\nDisputes over the integrity of Arizona’s election process continue, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. On May 22, a judge rejected Republican Kari Lake’s suit claiming misconduct in the 2022 gubernatorial election, which she lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThat same day, Arizona’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Sonny Borrelli questioned the security of the state’s voting machines in a letter sent to all 15 county boards of supervisors. Borelli told the officials that a concurrent resolution passed by the legislature earlier this year essentially bans electronic voting machines. Borelli claimed the legislature has “plenary authority” to override federal law and the governor.\n\nConservative commentator Tim Pool picked up on Borelli’s claim in a video posted on Facebook, quoting from the letter and falsely claiming that Arizona “has banned electronic voting machines in the 2024 election.”\n\nBut a resolution is defined in the Arizona Legislative Manual as “a declaration or expression of legislative opinion, will, intent or ‘resolve’ in matters within the Legislature’s legal purview.” It is not a law and has no legal power.\n\nStefanie Lindquist, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University, told us that the definition of resolution “doesn’t matter” to Borrelli, who is relying on the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives states absolute power over how elections are run.\n\nThat theory, which Borrelli referenced in his letter to election officials, is known as the independent legislature theory. It’s a reading of the Constitution advocated by some conservative lawyers that says state legislatures have the absolute power to regulate elections, with a legislature’s authority exceeding that of the governor, the courts and the electorate, Lindquist said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\n“What [Borrelli] is arguing is that by passing the concurrent resolution, the legislature has spoken, and under this particular theory, that’s all that’s needed,” Lindquist said.\n\nThe theory hinges on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of holding elections for senators and representatives “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” Borrelli’s letter said the clause “specifically conveys electronic voting systems (manner) are not mandated in statute to be used as a primary method for counting, tabulating, or verification.”\n\n“The letter is relying on a theory that has never been tested, and many constitutional scholars are skeptical of its validity,” Lindquist said.\n\nState officials have dismissed Borrelli’s letter.\n\nIn a statement issued on May 22, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said the resolution “does not have the force of law.”\n\nFontes, May 22: Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037, which expresses a desire to restrict the use of certain electronic voting machines, is non-binding and does not have the force of law. Election equipment must be certified by the federal and state government by specific requirements outlined in federal and state law. That certification process is being followed in Arizona and all applicable election equipment being used in Arizona is certified. If those requirements or certification process were to be changed, it would require a regular bill to be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — which is not the case for this non-binding resolution. We defer to the Attorney General’s office on all other legal questions.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, also a Democrat, agreed with that view. The resolution “is non-binding and has no legal impact,” a Mayes spokesman told the Arizona Mirror.\n\nArizona House and Senate Republicans passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 1037 in March, with voting along party lines. The resolution states that no electronic voting system can be used unless it meets certain criteria, including that it is made in the U.S. and has a publicly available source code.\n\nThe resolution contains language similar to Senate Bill 1074, which the state House and Senate passed and Hobbs vetoed on April 6.\n\n“The election equipment required by this bill, as well as the problem it purports to solve, does not exist,” the governor said at the time.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Biden Jr. of his victory.\n\nHere are four takeaways.\n\nTrump was directly involved in the ‘fake electors’ plan.\n\nThe committee showed evidence that Mr. Trump was directly involved behind the scenes in trying to put forward the alternate slates of Trump electors that he hoped could replace the electors awarded to Mr. Biden through his victories in swing states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, to ask her to talk to one of his outside lawyers, John Eastman, who was on the line, about the plan, Ms. McDaniel said in a video clip of her deposition to the committee. Mr. Trump wanted Ms. McDaniel, she said, to talk to Mr. Eastman “about the importance of the R.N.C. helping the campaign gather these contingent electors” if Mr. Trump’s legal challenges were successful.\n\nAs Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman were undertaking the scheme, the White House Counsel’s Office held a meeting with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and other aides, where they were told that the plan was not legally sound, according to recorded testimony from a West Wing aide, Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nThe committee did not say whether Mr. Trump was told about the meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office. Last week, the panel revealed that Mr. Trump had been told by Mr. Eastman that the broader effort they were pursuing to convince Vice President Mike Pence to block or delay certification of the Electoral College count in Mr. Biden’s favor had no legal basis — a fact that legal experts say could help prosecutors build a criminal case against Mr. Trump.\n\nG.O.P. elected officials pushed the electors scheme.\n\nThe committee showed that Republicans in Congress were pushing the alternate electors plan even on Jan. 6, hours before the day’s violence, which had the effect of stopping the certification of the electoral count as Mr. Pence was whisked away from the mob.\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told an aide for Mr. Pence on Jan. 6 that Mr. Johnson wanted to give Mr. Pence a list of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, two states won by Mr. Biden.\n\n“Johnson needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise,” Sean Riley, an aide to Mr. Johnson, texted an aide to Mr. Pence, according to messages released by the committee.\n\n“What is it?” Chris Hodgson, the aide to Mr. Pence, replied.\n\n“Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Mr. Riley said.\n\n“Do not give that to him,” Mr. Hodgson texted back.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, Alexa Henning, said on Twitter that he “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.”\n\nThe communications with the vice president’s office, she said, were “staff to staff” and the documents were never sent to Mr. Pence.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, another Trump ally on Capitol Hill, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, reached out to Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and a Republican, to see if he would support the decertification of Arizona’s electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Mr. Bowers recounted telling Mr. Biggs.\n\nTrump’s allies could not produce evidence of election fraud.\n\nThe committee showed examples of how Mr. Trump and his allies knew that there was no evidence that the election had been stolen.\n\nMr. Bowers recounted how Mr. Giuliani acknowledged to him at one point in a phone call that they could not find the evidence of fraud that they needed.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence,’” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani telling him. “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group, the three in my group and my counsel, both remembered that specifically, and afterwards, we kind of laughed about it.”\n\nAt another point, Mr. Eastman was pressing Mr. Bowers to embrace the plan to push a slate of Trump electors from Arizona despite the state’s certification of Mr. Biden’s victory there. Mr. Bowers said that he questioned how he could legally participate in the scheme and that Mr. Eastman responded by saying, “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.”\n\nThreats and intimidation started well before Jan. 6.\n\nThe public pressure that Mr. Trump and his allies put on state election officials resulted in the officials being targeted in frightening and intimidating ways by Trump supporters.\n\nShaye Moss, an elections worker in Fulton County, Ga., who, along with her mother, had been falsely accused by Mr. Giuliani of committing election fraud, provided a dramatic portrait of the harassment that Mr. Giuliani’s false claims had spawned. She described the racist messages she received on Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Ms. Moss said.\n\nShe said that the entire episode, and the attention that came with it, had “turned my life upside down.”\n\n“I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she said. “I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I’ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do nothing anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nShe said she loved her job as an election worker but ultimately quit.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, recounted how the home of his son’s widow had been broken into.\n\nMr. Bowers was the target of protests and threats as his daughter was dying. And he described how his office had received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voice mail messages and texts that made it impossible for him and his staff to communicate.\n\n“It is the new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with videos of me proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert and a corrupt politician and blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood,” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nChris Cameron contributed reporting.\n\nNeither Mr. Holder nor the committee has disclosed the contents of the full trove of videos, and neither has commented on whether it provides substantial new information about Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss.\n\nBut the small piece of it seen by The Times was striking for how it shows Ms. Trump using a different tone in describing her father’s efforts to overturn the outcome than she did in the portion of her deposition to the House committee that has been made public so far.\n\nThe interview for the documentary was conducted on Dec. 10, 2020, the person with access to the video said. That was nine days after a public statement by Attorney General William P. Barr, who declared at the time that there was no widespread fraud impacting the election’s outcome, a rare public rebuke of Mr. Trump’s claims at the time.\n\nIn her recorded interview with the House committee, Ms. Trump said that Mr. Barr’s comments “affected my perspective.”\n\n“I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he said,” she said. The committee may release additional video of her recorded testimony.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Trump have insisted that she had distanced herself from what was taking place around her father at that time. Those people have said that, after the race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Trump began focusing on winding down her office and looking toward a new life in Miami.\n\nYet in the video with the filmmaker, Ms. Trump, describing her father’s gains in votes among key demographic groups, had a different reaction when asked whether she had a “take” on her father’s “very clear position on the results and what’s going on.”\n\n“I think that, as the president has said, every single vote needs to be counted and needs to be heard, and he campaigned for the voiceless,” Ms. Trump replied. “And I think a lot of Americans feel very, very disenfranchised right now, and really, question the sanctity of our elections, and that’s not right, it’s not acceptable.”\n\nShe went on, “And he has to take on this fight. Look, you fight for what you love the most and he loves this country and he loves this country’s people, and he wants to make sure that their voice is, is heard and not muted.”\n\nShe said that he “will continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted and that’s what he should do.”\n\nAn aide to Ms. Trump did not respond to a message about the new video.\n\nThe filmmaker was connected to Mr. Kushner by Jason Greenblatt, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization and then the White House envoy to the Middle East. The film was envisioned as a legacy project for Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with how it came about.\n\nMr. Bowers, who spoke about the Constitution in reverential and spiritual terms, had tears in his eyes as he described his gravely ill daughter enduring some of the harassment outside their house. (She died in late January.)\n\n“It was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.”\n\nThe effort to persuade him to take steps to flip the outcome in Arizona to Mr. Trump’s column — the state was won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. — began with pressure from Mr. Trump, and one of his lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who maintained that he had evidence of fraud. “Aren’t we all Republicans here? I would think we would get a better reception,” Mr. Bowers recalled Mr. Giuliani saying at one point.\n\nSoon after Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, certified the state for Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani and an associate, Jenna Ellis, met with Arizona lawmakers, including Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers recalled. Mr. Bowers described Ms. Ellis asserting that they had evidence of widespread voter fraud, only to provide none.\n\n“I said, ‘I want the names. Do you have the names of the supposedly dead or fraudulent voters?’” Mr. Bowers said. “She said, ‘Yes.’”\n\nNothing was produced. Eventually, he recalled, Mr. Giuliani said, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”\n\nMr. Bowers also recalled speaking to Mr. Trump, making clear to the president that he “wouldn’t do anything illegal for him,” as one questioner, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said. Nonetheless, another lawyer advising Mr. Trump, John Eastman, called Mr. Bowers in early January and urged him to schedule a legislative vote to “decertify the electors, because we had plenary authority to do so.”\n\nMr. Eastman, Mr. Bowers testified, said that he should “just do it and let the courts figure it all out.”\n\nMr. Bowers again rejected the push, saying, “I took an oath — for me to take that, to do what you do would be counter to my oath.”\n\nFinally, he testified, there was a call from another Trump supporter, Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when the Electoral College vote was to be confirmed by a joint session of Congress. Mr. Biggs, he said, pushed him again to undo the state’s certification of its electors for Mr. Biden.\n\n“We have no legal pathway” to “execute such a request,” Mr. Bowers recalled saying. He also recalled his reaction when he learned that Trump advisers pushed ahead with a scheme to put forward slates of “alternate” electors. “I thought of the book, ‘The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,’” Mr. Bowers said.\n\nMr. Bowers’s personal journal contained an entry in which he said, “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” He was invited to read it into the testimony.\n\nHe was also asked for his reaction to a statement from Mr. Trump criticizing Mr. Bowers’s testimony in advance, in which he claimed that Mr. Bowers had told him the election was “rigged” and that he had won the state.\n\n“I did have a conversation with the president,” Mr. Bowers said. “That certainly isn’t it.”\n\nA moment later, more emphatically, he said, “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said the election was rigged — that would not be true.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/january-6-hearings-june-21/h_03fd1f3f997b1c3dfa43d17aa2353971', 'Headline': 'Jan. 6 hearings day 4 | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs urged Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers to throw out Biden electors and replace them with Trump electors on the morning of January 6. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)', 'Full_text': 'The latest hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new details Tuesday about how former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to help him overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe panel featured testimony from three Republican officials who were all on the receiving end of Trump’s outreach after the election: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers.\n\nLike previous hearings, these officials testified about their unwillingness to participate in legally dubious schemes that would undermine the election, including efforts to subvert the Electoral College with fake pro-Trump electors.\n\nThe panel’s next hearing is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Thursday and will focus on Trump’s attempt to use the Justice Department to back his election disinformation.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing:\n\nRepublican witnesses tie Trump directly to fake electors effort\n\nMultiple witnesses told the committee that Trump was personally involved in the effort to put forward slates of fake electors in key battleground states — a key part of the broader effort to overturn Biden’s legitimate election victory.\n\nCNN has previously reported on the role that key Trump allies, including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani, played in overseeing the effort but witnesses revealed new details Tuesday about how the former President himself was not only aware of the push, but seemingly endorsed it.\n\nBowers told the committee that he received a call from Trump and Giuliani during which they urged him to go along with a plan to put forward illegitimate, pro-Trump electors from the state.\n\n“I told them I did not want to be used as a pawn,” Bowers said on Tuesday, recalling what he told Giuliani and Trump on the Nov. 22, 2020 phone call.\n\nCommittee reveals new details about how congressional Republicans helped Trump’s efforts to overturn election\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured new details about two congressional Republicans played a role in Trump’s sprawling efforts to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. The first was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who called Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to support decertification of his state’s electors for Biden.\n\n“I said I would not,” Bowers testified on Tuesday.\n\nThe second occurred several hours later, minutes before then-Vice President Mike Pence gaveled in the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral votes. According to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked an aide to Pence how Johnson could hand-deliver him the fake slates of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not been sent to the National Archives. Pence’s aide responded that Johnson should “not give that to him.”\n\nBoth the effort to decertify Biden electors and put forward fake Trump electors were part of the Trump team’s scheme to stop the congressional certification of the election on Jan. 6. The role that Trump’s allies in Congress played have been of interest of interest to the committee, which has subpoenaed five House GOP members, including Biggs and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWitnesses describe how Trump’s lies had serious consequences — including threats\n\nThe committee’s hearing underscored how the lies about the election spread by Trump and his team spiraled into multi-faceted disasters for the state officials forced to grapple with them.\n\nAll of the witnesses who appeared at Tuesday’s hearing talked about the serious repercussions they faced as a result of the false claims that Trump and his team put forward. That included pressure to help in the effort to overturn the election, the repeated attempts to try to debunk the claims and the threats they faced from pro-Trump supporters for refusing to go along with Trump’s efforts.\n\nBowers delivered emotional testimony about “disturbing” protests outside his home. He got emotional as he discussed the impact protests at this house had on his wife and his daughter, who was at home gravely ill at the time and was “upset by what was happening outside.” He also read passages from his personal journal about friends who had turned on him.\n\nRaffensperger described the attacks that his wife faced after the election, which he said he suspected was an attempt to pressure him to quit. Schiff cited Raffensperger’s book, in which he wrote, “I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat.”\n\nRepublican officials take the lead testifying against Trump\n\nYet again, the Democratic-run January 6 committee turned to Republican officials to make their case against Trump. In fact, the majority of the in-person witnesses so far have been Republicans.\n\nTuesday’s hearing featured in-person testimony from three conservative Republicans who endorsed Trump in 2020. The committee also played deposition clips from two other GOP officials: Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler.\n\nThey all provided damning testimony against Trump, describing how he repeatedly tried to twist their arms and cajole them to overturn the results. They also described the threats and pressure they faced from Trump supporters who believed his election lies and protested outside their homes and offices and bombarded them with calls and text messages.\n\nTop Arizona Republican refutes Trump in real-time\n\nBowers said under oath Tuesday that Trump lied about him in a press release that came out shortly before the hearing started, where Trump claimed Bowers told him in November 2020 that he believed the election was rigged.\n\nIn the statement, Trump attacked Bowers and described a call they had after the election, claiming, “during the conversation, he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.” Trump added, “Bowers should hope there’s not a tape of the conversation.”\n\nUnder questioning from Schiff, Bowers confirmed that he “did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn’t it.”\n\nEmotional testimony highlights victims of Trump’s disinformation\n\nLater in the day, the committee heard from Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election. Trump, Giuliani and other GOP figures put them both at the center of their unhinged lies about massive voter fraud in Georgia.\n\nCoverage of Trump’s presidency often focused on his words and lies. But the emotional and deeply personal testimony from Moss and Freeman flipped the script and showed the human toll of Trump’s lies.\n\nThey described in devastating terms how Trump’s lies essentially destroyed their lives.\n\nMoss said she felt “helpless” and stopped giving out her business card because “I don’t want anyone knowing my name.” Her mother said she gets “nervous when I have to give food orders” because someone who believes Trump’s lies might recognize her name. She said she felt “homeless” while she lived in hiding for two months after the FBI told her she wasn’t safe at home.\n\n“I have lost my sense of security, all because of a group of people, starting with (Trump) and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me, and my daughter, Shaye, to push lies about how the election was stolen,” Freeman said in a videotaped deposition, a clip of which was played during Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, made a public appeal for testimony from former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone at the end of Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nThe request raises a new tension behind the scenes, where the House is still seeking testimony from one of the most significant advisers to former President Donald Trump in the last days of his White House.\n\nCheney noted that upcoming hearings will shed light on Cipollone and others in his office doing “what was right,” as they tried to stop some Trump’s movements leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. Others who sided with Cipollone and against Trump at crucial moments, including former top Justice Department officials, have already spoken with the committee and had clips of their depositions used in hearings so far.\n\nNearly every person in Trump’s innermost circle in the White House, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, sat for questioning in the House. Cippoline has met informally with the committee, but clips of any closed-door interview with Cipollone have not been shown in any of the hearings so far.\n\nCNN reported last week that Cipollone was not expected to appear. One other inner circle White House adviser, Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, has refused to testify.\n\nTestimony from Cipollone would be especially notable because his predecessor in the Trump White House, Donald McGahn, resisted testifying in a congressional probe about the Russia investigation for years. The Trump administration claimed the former White House counsel had absolute immunity — a position the Biden administration rolled back, leaving McGahn to testify about Trump to Congress last year.\n\nThe Biden administration has not used broad claims of executive privilege to protect large amounts of testimony from the Jan. 6 committee, though Trump has repeatedly said he believes some of his conversations with top advisers should be kept confidential.\n\n“Our committee is certain that Mr. Trump does not want Mr. Cipollone to testify here,” Cheney said.\n\nCheney spoke to reporters in the hallway after Thursday’s hearings, telling them that the committee will “continue to reach out” to Cipollone.\n\nAsked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Tuesday’s hearing showed any criminal behavior by Trump, Cheney said: “I think that you’ve seen throughout the hearings that we are putting forward very clearly a number of instances in which there are serious questions about the actions of the former President. We’ll continue to do so.”\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, Cipollone has resisted providing public testimony, believing that he has sufficiently cooperated with the committee by sitting for a closed-door interview along with his deputy Pat Philbin,\n\nThe Biden White House cleared Cipollone and Philbin’s private interview after weeks of discussions that navigated the sensitive issues raised by having a White House counsel, one of the closest advisers to a president, sit down with the committee.\n\nTrump has not raised objections to Cipollone and Philbin talking to the committee despite claiming executive privilege claims over other testimony and documents, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nThe prospect of having Cipollone appear at a public hearing harkens back to John Dean and the Nixon era, an uncomfortable prospect for Cipollone who has long sought to keep a low profile.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju and Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting to this post.\n\nA video produced by the House Select Committee detailed former President Donald Trump and his team’s efforts to sway election officials and intimidate election workers following President Biden’s 2020 election win.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the details the committee laid out:\n\nProtests outside officials’ homes: In a video played by the committee, protesters stood outside the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson calling her a “tyrant and a felon,” as she was putting her child to sleep. She described to the committee, via audio recording, her fear for her family’s safety.\n\nPersonal phone numbers posted online: In late November 2020, Trump invited delegations from Michigan and Pennsylvania to the White House. After Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, told Trump that he would not break the law to keep Trump in office, he said Trump posted Shirkey’s personal phone number for his millions of followers on Facebook, urging them to contact him and demand he decertify Michigan’s election results. Shirkey said he received “just shy of 4,000 text messages over the short period of time, calling to take action.”\n\nDaily phone calls: Following his refusal to contest his state’s election results, Pennsylvania House Speaker Brian Cutler said he received daily phone calls from former Trump lawyer’s Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Lewis asking to discuss the election. Cutler said he asked his lawyers to tell the pair to stop calling, saying their efforts were inappropriate: they did not stop. One month later, long-time Trump ally Steve Bannon announced a protest against Cutler at his home and offices. Cutler said his then-15-year-old son was home alone when the first protest happened. He said that his personal information was leaked online and received so many calls to his home phone, that he had to disconnect it because messages were filling up so fast at all hours of the night. The select committee showed an anonymous voice mail Cutler received saying that the caller was outside his home.\n\nMillions of dollars in ads: According to the committee, the Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on ads pushing election fraud claims and urging Americans to call their legislators and demand they inspect voting machines.\n\n“20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts”: Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers described to the committee the harassment he and his family faced after refusing to decertify his state’s election results. Bowers said he and his team received “20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts.” At home, Bowers’ Saturdays were filled with protests by various groups disrupting the neighborhood with trucks playing videos claiming he was a pedophile and pervert. He recalled a confrontation between a protester with a gun who was vocally threatening his neighbor. Bowers detailed his family’s strength during this time, especially that of his wife and then “gravely-ill” daughter.\n\nDeath threats and a home break in: The committee played excerpts of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call obtained by CNN between Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Trump where the former President urged Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn the election. Raffensperger refused, claiming Georgia’s election results were accurate. Following this conversation, he said both he and his wife were doxed and received death threats, he told the committee. Additionally, he said his widowed daughter-in-law’s home was broken into while she was alone with her two young children.\n\n“I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security”: Former Fulton County, Georgia, election workers Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman were specifically targeted by Trump’s team to push false allegations of voter fraud. The pair worked the 2020 presidential election and were named 18 times by Trump in the call made to Raffensperger. In that call, Trump called Freeman a “professional vote scammer and a hustler.” Moss detailed the harassment her grandmother faced as well, including a home invasion where people were looking for Moss and Freeman, claiming to be making a citizen’s arrest. In a video testimony to the committee, Freeman said, “I’ve lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation, I’ve lost my sense of security.” Prior to Jan. 6, the FBI advised Freeman to leave her home for safety — she was gone for two months.\n\nThe House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, just wrapped up its fourth hearing of the month.\n\nThe panel heard live testimony from several Georgia election officials about former President Trump’s efforts to try to pressure state officials to overturn the 2020 election, incorrectly claiming there was voter fraud.\n\nThe witnesses testified about the details of their conversations with the former President. They also said they experienced threats and harassment as a result of Trump’s lies. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his chief operating officer Gabe Sterling and former Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss were on the panels.\n\nRaffensperger emerged as a national figure in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Trump urged Georgia’s chief elections officer to “find” enough votes to overturn the state’s election results.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had already spoken privately with the Jan. 6 committee about his experience in addition to testifying before the special grand jury in the criminal probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the Peach State.\n\nHere’s what the officials told the Jan. 6 committee:\n\nBrad Raffensperger: Raffensperger said he and his team investigated “every single allegation” of election fraud from former President Trump — and they came up with nothing indicating any fraud whatsoever.\n\nHe said in the face of threats and harassment to him and his family, he didn’t walk away because he knew his office had followed the law. “I think sometimes, moments require you to stand up and just take the shots,” he said. “We followed the law and we followed the Constitution, and at the end of the day, President Trump came up short.”\n\nRaffensperger said the numbers don’t lie, explaining to the committee how the ballots were checked three separate times, all with very close accuracy. “Every allegation we checked. We ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate,” he said.\n\nGabe Sterling: Sterling described the misinformation and threats that were being directed at workers in the days after the election. During testimony, he recalled the moment he “lost it” when he found out an election contractor working for Dominion Systems was receiving death threats “that had been posted by some QAnon supporters.” After that, he started trying to combat misinformation at news conferences and said that he even argued with some family members about false claims of election fraud.\n\nHe said the job of the secretary of state’s office is to continue to combat that feeling and “get the facts out, do our job, tell the truth, follow the Constitution, follow the law and defend the institutions… and the institutions held.”\n\nWandrea “Shaye” Moss: Moss was accused by Trump and others of carrying out a fake ballot scheme in Fulton County, Georgia. She said she and her family received threats and Trump’s lies turned her life “upside down.” Moss told the committee about “hateful” and “racist” threats she received via Facebook.\n\n“A lot of threats, wishing death upon me. Telling me that, you know, I’ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like ‘be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920,’” Moss said, adding that she loved her job and loved helping voters with any questions they had.\n\nThe committee also played video of recorded testimony from Moss’ mother, Ruby Freeman. She said she lost her “name and her reputation,” adding that she left her home for about two months ahead of Jan. 6, 2021, after the FBI told her it wouldn’t be safe. Freeman said agents told her she needed to stay away until “at least the inauguration.” She also testified that even today there is “nowhere” she feels safe.\n\nRead takeaways from today’s hearing here.\n\nThe head of the Republican Party testified to the House select committee that former President Donald Trump called her as part of an effort to use fake electors to support him.\n\nThe new detail links Trump directly to efforts to put forward rogue, alternate slates of electors in states that he lost, even though his top lawyers in the White House and the campaign knew the approach wasn’t legally sound.\n\nShe noted that the electors were being pulled together in case Trump legal challenges succeeded in blocking Biden wins.\n\nThe campaign wasn’t entirely on board, however.\n\nSome of the top officials in the Trump campaign and White House believed the fake electors plan wasn’t legal, and left the push to lawyers like Eastman and Rudy Giuliani who had swarmed after the election, the committee said.\n\nIn an interview with the committee, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to the White House chief of staff, confirmed to the committee that lawyers with the White House counsel said the plot was not legally sound. She said former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani were involved in the meeting.\n\nTwo top campaign lawyers, Matt Morgan and Justin Clark, said in their taped depositions that they told Trump lawyers pushing the fake electors scheme they didn’t want to take part.\n\n“You just get after it. I’m out,” Clark told the House, about a conversation he had with another lawyer who backed the fake electors plan, Kenneth Chesebro. “I don’t think this is appropriate. This isn’t the right thing to do.”\n\nMorgan described directing another campaign official to tell Chesebro: “This is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward. This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero.”\n\nBefore Tuesday, it wasn’t known that Clark had spoken to the House select committee.\n\nA source familiar with Clark’s testimony says he testified “a while back” and that Trump is likely not pleased his former lead campaign attorney is shown saying essentially his campaign didn’t have a case to back up Trump’s lies.\n\nClark still works with Trump. Last year he directed witnesses the House had subpoenaed to preserve executive privilege, and he represented Trump in his unsuccessful appeal to try to stop the release of White House documents from the National Archives.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol turns its attention Tuesday to the campaign to pressure state-level officials to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe hearing will focus in particular on then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in Arizona and in Georgia — where Trump infamously asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes he needed to win.\n\nCommittee aides said the witnesses testifying in person on Tuesday from Arizona and Georgia will be able to speak to the pressure campaign that came from the White House, as well as the backlash they received from Trump’s supporters.\n\nThe witnesses from Georgia include Raffensperger and his chief operating officer, Gabe Sterling, both of whom faced relentless attacks from Trump after certifying the state’s election. Fulton County election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who was falsely accused by Trump of ballot fraud, will also testify about the backlash she faced.\n\nArizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican, will testify about the pressure he received from Trump and Giuliani, according to committee aides.\n\nHere are key things to watch for during today’s hearing:\n\nThe Meadows connection: Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee member who will lead Tuesday’s hearing, told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the hearing would show how Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had played an “intimate role” in the efforts to pressure Georgia state legislators and election officials.\n\nThe California Democrat said the committee would release new text messages showing that Meadows had wanted to send autographed “Make America Great Again” hats to those conducting Georgia’s post-election audit.\n\nCommittee aides said the hearing would “demonstrate his involvement” in Georgia in the run-up to Jan. 6.\n\nMeadows reached out multiple times to Raffensperger after the 2020 election, according to text messages obtained by CNN, and he participated in Trump’s January 2021 call where the former President asked Raffensperger to “find” the votes the then-President needed to win.\n\nWhile that call was going on, Meadows was texting with the deputy secretary of state, who urged him to end the call that now stands at the center of Fulton County’s investigation into whether any of the actions Trump or his allies took related to Georgia’s election were criminal.\n\nTestimony from those who faced backlash from Trump’s attacks: The witnesses will be able to testify firsthand on Tuesday about the impact of Trump’s pressure campaign and false claims about the election — as they all were subjected to attacks and threats.\n\nAides said that Bowers, the Arizona secretary of state, will be able to testify about the “campaign of harassment” he was subjected to in the run-up to January 6 and the months that followed.\n\nRaffensperger and Sterling were attacked by Trump and his allies for certifying Georgia’s election. Sterling warned in a December 2020 news conference that “it’s all gone too far” after local election officials had been subjected to threats and harassment.\n\nMoss, who was a Fulton County election worker in 2020, will testify how her mother’s and her lives were upended and they were forced to go into hiding after Moss was accused by Trump of carrying out a fake ballot scheme, according to committee aides. She and another election worker sued Giuliani last year.\n\nIn her written testimony provided on Monday, Moss said the false stories accusing her of taking part in voter fraud had led to her receiving death threats.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nBritish filmmaker Alex Holder acknowledged Tuesday that he has complied with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, turning over footage that includes never-before-seen interviews with former President Donald Trump, members of the Trump family and then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHolder, who was filming a documentary series surrounding the final six weeks of Trump’s re-election campaign, wrote in a statement Tuesday that the interviews were filmed before and after the events of Jan. 6.\n\nHolder also says he will be deposed by the committee on Thursday. Politico first reported the committee’s subpoena of Holder. A Select Committee spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSenior Trump campaign officials were caught off guard when they learned that the British filmmaker was given extensive access in the final weeks of President Trump’s 2020 campaign, several told CNN.\n\nThe first time senior campaign staff heard of the documentary was when it was reported by Politico Tuesday morning, according to one of the senior staffers. Another senior official on the campaign told CNN he was totally unaware Trump was cooperating with Holder, who says he has complied with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee to share his footage.\n\nThis aide, who traveled often with the President and worked out of his Arlington, Virginia, campaign headquarters, said he was also never asked to sign anything granting his permission to be filmed.\n\n“I don’t remember it. I honestly don’t recall ever being told about something like that,” the official said.\n\n“The first time senior 2020 campaign leadership ever heard of the documentary was this morning’s Politico Playbook,” another added.\n\nStephanie Grisham, who was chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump during the campaign, told CNN she “had no idea” a filmmaker was documenting Trump’s reelection campaign and final days in the White House.\n\nA third campaign official also said the committee’s subpoena of a documentary filmmaker who was cooperating with Trump was news to him even though he spent most of his time on the campaign trail with the candidate himself.\n\n“I heard about it in passing,” said a third Trump campaign official, who is now involved in Trump’s post-presidential operation. “It wasn’t necessarily a secret.”\n\nTwo attorneys for Trump’s 2020 campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot, said Sunday he thinks the committee is presenting a case against former President Trump that would “rise to a level of criminal involvement,” while also making clear that the Justice Department will ultimately decide whether to bring criminal charges for what happened on and leading up to Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Obviously, you know, we’re not a criminal charges committee. So I want to be careful in specifically using that language, but I think what we’re presenting before the American people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath,” he added.\n\nCNN has reported committee members are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are divided over whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, according to four sources connected to the panel.\n\nThe Illinois Republican reiterated this week’s hearings will focus on Trump’s efforts to push state officials to overturn 2020 election results, as well as a broader pressure campaign to involve the Justice Department in his scheme.\n\nHe said the committee’s purpose is to lay out Trump’s actions to the American people, and “what can the Department of Justice do in a court of law…that’s up to them. They can, you know, have their own information, they’ll be able to see what we’re doing here.”\n\nABC’s George Stephanopoulos said Kinzinger’s staff shared threatening communications with ABC News that the congressman had received that was too “ugly” and “dangerous” to share with viewers on screen.\n\nKinzinger explained the message was mailed to his house a few days ago from the local area, threatening to execute him, his wife and their five-month-old child.\n\n“I don’t worry, but now that I have a wife and kids, of course, it’s a little different,” he said. “There is violence in the future. I’m going to tell you. And until we get a grip on telling people the truth, we can’t expect any differently,” he said.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee will show evidence at its upcoming hearing about then-President Donald Trump’s involvement in a scheme to submit fake slates of electors in the 2020 presidential election, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel, said Sunday.\n\nFederal prosecutors are reviewing the fake Electoral College certifications created by Trump allies that falsely declared him the winner of seven states that he lost in 2020. The fake certificates were sent to the National Archives in the weeks after the election and had no impact on the electoral outcome.\n\nWhen asked by Bash specifically if the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol had evidence Trump directed the fake electors scheme, Schiff responded, “I don’t want to get ahead of our hearing.”\n\n“We’ll show during the hearing what the President’s role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates of electors, how that scheme depended initially on hopes that the legislators would reconvene and bless it,” he said, adding, “We will show you what we know about his role in this.”\n\nThe committee’s upcoming hearing on Tuesday will also feature Georgia election officials and the Arizona House speaker who resisted pressure from Trump and his campaign to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nWith regards to witnesses: Schiff also said the committee still has “several key people we have not interviewed we would like to” and could still possibly subpoena former Vice President Mike Pence as part of its investigation.\n\n“(He’s) certainly a possibility,” Schiff said. “We’re not excluding anyone or anything at this point.”\n\nAlso Sunday, another House January 6 panelist said there needed to be “accountability” for the wrongdoing displayed in evidence and testimony before the select committee, but stopped short of calling on the Department of Justice to charge Trump.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “accountability can mean two things. One is individual criminal accountability that people pay for their particular crimes, as more than 800 people have already been prosecuted for everything from assaulting a federal officer to interfering with a federal proceeding to seditious conspiracy.”\n\n“But accountability also means collective accountability, and that’s the real project,” he continued. “Telling the truth to the people so we can make decisions about how to fortify democratic institutions going forward.”\n\nMeanwhile, when asked by Bash about the January 6 committee’s decision not to turn over documents related to its investigation to the DOJ, Schiff defended the panel’s stance, saying, “I don’t think Congress has ever done that.”\n\nThe Justice Department had raised concerns in court that the select committee had not shared transcripts and was jeopardizing its ability to prosecute and investigate the Jan. 6 events. Schiff said the committee will work with the DOJ and “want them to be successful in bringing people to justice, but I can’t go into the private conversations.”\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol wrapped up its third hearing of the month on Thursday. The panel presented evidence that outlined former President Donald Trump’s role in pressuring former Vice President Mike Pence into blocking the 2020 election results.\n\nThrough live testimony from former Pence attorney Greg Jacob and retired judge J. Michael Luttig, recorded depositions and excerpts from emails and memos, the committee showed that Trump was told the plan to reverse the results of the election was not legal — but he tried it anyway.\n\nHere are the top headlines you might have missed:\n\nTrump’s attempts to pressure Pence: In her opening statements, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney said that what Trump wanted Pence to do “was not just wrong, it was illegal and unconstitutional.” Members of the committee are in wide agreement that Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department, four sources connected to the panel told CNN.\n\nA “constitutional crisis:” Luttig testified that if Pence had followed Trump’s orders to reject the 2020 election result, it “would have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the republic.” He also testified that he believes the Jan. 6 committee is examining the “profound truth” of the US. He later said he “would have laid (his) body across the road” before advising Pence to overturn the election.\n\nProximity to the mob: The committee also laid out a timeline detailing the effort going on during the insurrection to protect Pence. The panel said the vice president was very close to the rioters, and at one point there was only “40 feet between the vice president and the mob.” According to committee member and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar: “Make no mistake about the fact that the vice president’s life was in danger.”\n\nThe John Eastman memo: Eastman, a former Trump attorney, perpetuated the theory that Pence had the authority to decide the results of the election. In the memo presented by Cheney, Eastman argues there is a “historical precedent” for the vice president to reject electors. Luttig said in his testimony that Eastman was “incorrect” and there is no precedent and nothing in the Constitution or US laws that support the theory in the memo. Jacob then testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously.\n\nPressure even after the insurrection: Even after the Capitol riot was over, the committee said Eastman wrote an email that night imploring Jacob to suspend the session to certify the election. Jacob said he did not show Pence the email right away, but shared it a “day or two later.” Eastman argued a technical violation of the Electoral Count Act, the law that governed the Jan. 6 congressional certification of the electors. A few days after the insurrection, Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani asking to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, according to the committee.\n\nIn the West Wing: Jacob testified that Pence called him into his office when he first heard the theory that the vice president could announce the outcome of the election. “The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way that our framers, who abhorred concentrated power and who had broken away from the tyranny of George III, would ever have put one person — particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election — in a role to have a decisive impact on the outcome of the election,” Jacob said, adding that instinct was correct. He said Pence’s legal team reviewed every election in American history, and no vice president in 230 years has ever claimed to have that kind of authority.\n\nRead key takeaways from the hearing:\n\nThe Republican who serves as Georgia’s top elections official is set to testify before the hearing held by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nBrad Raffensperger, 66, is probably best known for refusing then-President Donald Trump’s push in a bombshell phone call to “find” votes in Trump’s favor needed to overturn the 2020 presidential results in Georgia. During the Jan. 2, 2021, call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he had won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.\n\nRaffensperger has continued to defend his performance and remains committed to the idea that the election was conducted fairly and offered a warning to those who charged otherwise without evidence.\n\nIt was among the strongest public stands for election integrity taken by a Republican under immense pressure from Trump and his followers — and it wasn’t without consequences.\n\n“You and your family will be killed very slowly,” read one anonymous text that Raffensperger’s wife, Tricia, told Reuters in an exclusive interview last year that she had received, an example of the kinds of threats and scrutiny his family faced. Brad Raffensperger told CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” at the time that the threats were unacceptable.\n\nRaffensperger became a pariah of sorts within the GOP, facing calls for resignation from within his own party and censure at the Georgia GOP convention in 2021 due to “dereliction of his constitutional duty.”\n\n“Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” he said at the time in response to the calls for him to step down.\n\n“As secretary of state, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts and that illegal votes don’t count,” Raffensperger continued.\n\nRaffensperger, whose term is set to end next year, is running for reelection. He faced three opponents in the primary election in May, and CNN projected Raffensperger would win andbe the GOP nominee.\n\nHis leading opponent, Republican Rep. Jody Hice, had aligned himself with Trump’s political brand and previously said Trump would’ve won the 2020 election in Georgia if it had been “fair” — a stance that garnered an endorsement from the former President.\n\nIn a primary field in which his Republican opponents had committed themselves to fighting voter fraud — despite the fact that such fraud barely exists and President Biden’s 2020 victory in the Peach State was affirmed by three ballot counts — Raffensperger has expressed commitment to the same issue.\n\nRaffensperger has also supported a controversial law passed in the wake of Biden’s victory to impose new voting restrictions.\n\nThe secretary of state, who touts himself as a conservative Republican, took office in 2019. He had served two terms in the Georgia General Assembly in 2015-2019.\n\nRead more about the official here.\n\nJustice Department officials are watching the House select committee Jan. 6 hearings for what kind of possible crimes the committee believes it has uncovered.\n\nMembers of the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are in wide agreement that former President Donald Trump committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. But they are split over what to do about it, sources close to the committee said.\n\nIt’s possible that at the end of the panel’s investigation, it makes criminal referrals or something less formal by turning over evidence that prosecutors could examine.\n\nRemember: A criminal referral is not an official responsibility of the Jan. 6 panel. And the DOJ would be under no legal obligation to act on the committee’s request, though it could force Attorney General Merrick Garland and his prosecutors into a difficult public position.\n\nAt the same time, if the committee opts not to make a referral, it would likely miss its best chance of making a forceful statement that it believes Trump committed a crime. Choosing not to make a referral would also mean abdicating one of the committee’s only levers of political pressure at its disposal.\n\nDuring a hearing for the criminal case against the Proud Boys, Justice Department prosecutors said that the committee is planning to release all 1,000 witness transcripts from its investigation in early September, coinciding with the trial of five Proud Boys charged with seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the riot.\n\nWhere the DOJ investigation stands: Seventeen months after the riot, the Justice Department has arrested over 840 individuals, charging roughly 255 with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers that day – 90 of whom are charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, over 50 defendants have been charged with conspiracy, ranging from conspiring to obstruct a congressional proceeding to conspiring to obstruct law enforcement.\n\nSixteen individuals – members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers – have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged actions that day, three of whom have pleaded guilty to the charge.\n\nBut the investigation is not close to being over. The Justice Department is still looking for over 350 individuals who they say “committed violent acts on Capitol grounds.”\n\nMost recently: A Capitol rioter pleaded guilty Friday to carrying a loaded firearm on Capitol grounds and assaulting police officers with one of their own batons during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nMark Mazza told federal investigators he regretted not seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the riot and that they would be talking “for another reason” if he had seen her. He faces a maximum of 20 years for assaulting officers with a dangerous weapon.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mazza, 57, carried a revolver loaded with shotgun and hollow point rounds in a holster under his shirt during the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot and on Capitol grounds later that day.\n\nThe fourth Jan. 6 hearing this month is about to start. Here are some key points to catch up on before the next hearing gets underway.\n\nFormer President Trump didn’t want the Capitol riot to stop\n\nDuring the committee’s first prime-time hearing, it revealed testimony from Trump White House officials who said the former president did not want the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, to stop. He angrily resisted his advisers urging him to call off the rioters and thought his own vice president “deserved” to be hanged, according to the testimony.\n\nVice Chair Liz Cheney described a witness who said Trump was aware of chants to “hang Mike Pence” and seemed to approve of them.\n\nLater, at the hearing last week, the committee sought to connect Trump’s pressure campaign against Pence to the violence on Jan. 6 by weaving together testimony from Pence aides, as well as Trump’s public statements and comments from rioters at the Capitol.\n\nMany of the rioters had listened to Trump’s rallies where he claimed — inaccurately — that the election was rigged against him, and Pence had the power to do something about it while presiding over the Electoral College certification, the committee said.\n\nAnd many of them saw, in real time, Trump’s tweet criticizing Pence while the Capitol was under attack, where he said Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”\n\nThe committee showed that the mob got about 40 feet from Pence.\n\nJohn Eastman knew his theory to overturn the election was illegal\n\nThe hearing underscored how John Eastman, a former Trump attorney, had pushed over and over for Pence to try to overturn the election, despite facing sharp resistance from White House lawyers and Pence’s team.\n\nThe committee showed memos in which Eastman laid out his theory. Witnesses from Pence’s legal team testified that there was nothing in the Constitution or US law that supported the scheme. The committee played testimony from video depositions where White House officials explained how they thought Eastman’s theory was “nutty” before Jan. 6 — and told him so. Former Pence attorney Greg Jacob described Eastman’s plans as “certifiably crazy.”\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 6 — after rioters had attacked the Capitol and forced the vice president and his team to flee — Eastman tried to leverage the delay in certification by arguing there had been a minor violation of the Electoral Count Act and Pence should delay for 10 days as a result.\n\nJacob also testified that Eastman told him that he knew the theory would lose at the Supreme Court unanimously. Eastman emailed Rudy Giuliani a few days after Jan. 6 and asked to be included on a list of potential recipients of a presidential pardon, the committee said.\n\nTrump was told Eastman’s plan was illegal but tried it anyway\n\nAccording to witness testimony, Pence himself and the lawyer who concocted the scheme advised Trump directly that the plan was unconstitutional and violated federal law. Committee members argued that this shows Trump’s corrupt intentions and could lay the groundwork for a potential indictment.\n\nIn a videotaped deposition, which was played Thursday, Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short said Pence advised Trump “many times” that he didn’t have the legal or constitutional authority to overturn the results while presiding over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 to count the electoral votes.\n\nEven Eastman, who pitched the scheme to Trump, admitted in front of Trump that the plan would require Pence to violate federal law, according to a clip of a deposition from Jacob.\n\nLegal scholars from across the political spectrum agree that Eastman’s plan was preposterous. J. Michael Luttig, the former federal judge who advised Pence during the transition, testified that he “would have laid my body across the road” before letting Pence illegally overturn the election.\n\nCommittee argues Trump peddled fraud claims after he was personally told they were not legitimate\n\nOne of the primary areas of focus of the committee has been to underscore the idea that Trump and some of his allies continued to peddle false claims of election fraud after they were personally told those claims were not legitimate.\n\nThe committee made the argument that Trump was repeatedly told by his own top officials, including former Attorney General William Barr and ex-Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, that the myriad of fraud claims he was pushing were groundless and were certainly not evidence that the election was stolen.\n\nYet, Trump and some of his allies continued to push these false claims all the way through January in what the committee attempted to show was a bad-faith effort to overturn the election despite consistently being told those claims were not valid.\n\nTrump’s team and family turn against him\n\nThe committee’s first hearing was bolstered with never-before-seen video clips showing members of Trump’s White House and campaign – as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner – speaking about how they didn’t believe Trump’s claims that the election was stolen.\n\nBarr said that Trump’s claims of voter fraud were “bullshit.” Ivanka Trump said that she respected Barr and “accepted what he was saying” about the election.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said a campaign data staffer told Trump in “pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose.”\n\nAnd the committee cited testimony from Trump campaign lawyer Alex Cannon, who testified he told Meadows by “mid-to-late November” that the campaign had come up empty trying to find widespread fraud in key states that Trump lost. Cannon said Meadows responded to his assessment by saying, “so there’s no there there.”\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is set to continue to lay out its findings during a public hearing this morning. When and how the events occurred that day have been a key part of their probe.\n\nSupporters of then-President Trump breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, engulfing the building in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to protest against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to certify President Biden’s win.\n\nHere’s how key events unfolded throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump’s speech:\n\nAt 1:10 p.m. ET, while Congress began the process of affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, Trump encouraged his supporters to protest at the US Capitol. Despite promising he would join them, Trump retreated to the White House in his SUV and watched on television as the violence unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET, hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers “traitors” for doing their jobs.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Then-Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\n\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door as of 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they had successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and towards the Rotunda, and they were removing them out of the East and West doors of the Capitol.\n\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building.\n\nWith about 30 minutes to go before Washington, DC’s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\n\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business — namely, confirming Biden’s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\n\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence — who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary — bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier on the evening of Jan. 6 that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session that night.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the “United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.”\n\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning (Jan. 7, 2021), but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden’s election win.\n\nSee the full timeline of events here.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have been investigating what happened before, after and during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — and now they are presenting what they discovered to the public.\n\nThe committee is holding another hearing Tuesday as it continues to roll out preliminary findings from its investigation in a series of presentations this month.\n\nThe committee is made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans. It was formed after efforts to create an independent 9/11-style commission failed.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. In July 2021, Pelosi invited GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to join the committee, making him the second GOP lawmaker to sit on the panel.\n\nHere’s who is on the panel — and key things to know about them:\n\nDemocrats:\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chairman: Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is the chairman of the House select committee. Thompson also serves as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, the first Democrat to hold the position. As chairman of the Homeland Security panel, Thompson introduced and oversaw the House’s passage of the legislative recommendations after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Thompson is a civil rights pioneer who started his political career by registering fellow African Americans to vote in the segregated South. His first political victory was being elected the first Black mayor of his hometown of Bolton, Mississippi. He is the only Democrat serving in Mississippi’s delegation. Thompson views the work of the Jan. 6 committee in the same vein as his work in the civil rights struggle.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar: Aguilar is a Democrat from Southern California. Before coming to Congress, he served as the mayor of Redlands, California. Aguilar is considered a rising star in the House Democratic Caucus. As vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus he is the highest-ranking Latino member in congressional leadership. In addition to his role on the Jan. 6 committee, Aguilar has several high-profile committee assignments. He also is a member of the committees on Appropriations and House Administration. Aguilar believes the committee’s most important job is creating a full, comprehensive record of what led to the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren: Lofgren is a Democrat from California who served as an impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial against Trump. Lofgren is also chair of the Committee on House Administration. She was first elected to Congress in 1994 and also served as a staffer on Capitol Hill for eight years. Lofgren has a background as an immigration lawyer and has made reforming immigration law a key part of her portfolio as a member of Congress. She also represents a big part of the Silicon Valley and as a result has had a heavy focus on tech related issues. She is a long-time ally and friend to Pelosi. The duo has served in the California Congressional delegation together for close to three decades and both represent different parts of the bay area in Northern California.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria: Luria is a Democrat from the Virginia Beach area who represents a community with a significant number of constituents connected to the military. Luria is a Navy Veteran. She served 20 years as an officer on Navy ships, retiring as a commander. She has attributed her military background as part of her motivation for serving on the Jan. 6 committee and getting to the bottom of what happened on that day. Of the nine members of the committee, Luria is facing the toughest general election in the fall midterms.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy: Murphy is a Democrat from Florida and is the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress. Before serving in Congress, Murphy was a national security specialist in the office of the US Secretary of Defense. Murphy said the challenge for committee members is to translate the mountains of information learned through the investigation into a digestible narrative for the American people. Murphy announced in December 2021 that she would not be seeking reelection.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin: Raskin is a Democrat from Maryland who previously served as the lead impeachment manager for Democrats during Trump’s second impeachment trial. In the days before the Capitol insurrection, Raskin announced the death by suicide of his 25-year-old son, Tommy, on New Years Eve 2020. Raskin reflected on the tragic loss of his son, and his experience living through the attack on the Capitol, in his book “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth and the Trials of American Democracy.” Raskin said that becoming the lead House impeachment manager last year served as a “lifeline” in the aftermath of his son’s death, describing to David Axelrod on “The Axe Files” podcast how Pelosi asked him to lead the second impeachment managers.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff: Schiff is a Democrat from California and also serves as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the lead impeachment manager representing Democrats during Trump’s first impeachment trial. “January 6 will be remembered as one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. Yet, more than a year later, the threat to our democracy is as grave as ever. January 6 was not a day in isolation, but the violent culmination of multiple efforts to overturn the last presidential election and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in our history,” Schiff said in a statement to CNN.\n\nRepublicans\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chair: Cheney, who represents Wyoming, serves as the vice chairwoman on the committee. Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump and was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach him. House Republicans have punished her for her public opposition to Trump by removing her as their party’s conference chairwoman in May of last year and she faces a Trump-endorsed challenger in the GOP primary in her reelection bid. That primary is in August. Cheney told CBS in an interview that aired over the weekend that she believes the January 6 attack was a conspiracy, saying when asked, “I do. It is extremely broad. It’s extremely well organized. It’s really chilling.” She has even gone as far to say that Trump’s inaction to intervene as the attack unfolded was a “dereliction of duty.”\n\nAdam Kinzinger: Kinzinger of Illinois broke with his party by accepting the appointment from Pelosi. Kinzinger, once thought to have a bright future in GOP politics, has taken heavy criticism from his colleagues because of his criticism of Trump. He has placed much of the blame of inciting the violence that day on Trump and his allies. Kinzinger is one of 10 Republicans who voted twice to impeach Trump after the Capitol insurrection. He also voted for the bipartisan independent commission to investigate the riot. His willingness to take on Trump led to the former President personally promising to back a primary opponent. Instead of facing the prospect of a Trump back challenge, he chose to retire from Congress at the end of his current term.'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/politics/arizona-bill-reject-election-results/index.html', 'Headline': 'An Arizona bill would empower state legislators to reject ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Arizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.', 'Full_text': 'Republican lawmakers in Arizona are pushing a raft of major changes to the state’s voting laws, including a controversial bill that would empower legislators to reject election results.\n\nThe proposal, sponsored by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers, also seeks to overhaul several established election procedures in the battleground state. It would mandate, for instance, that election workers hand-count ballots instead of using electronic equipment to tabulate results.\n\nThe bill would “create a system where losers can set aside the will of the people,” said Alex Gulotta, who runs the Arizona chapter of the voting rights group All Voting is Local. “This is an all-out assault on the freedom to vote.”\n\nThe bill’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. John Fillmore, told CNN in a telephone interview that he’s trying to “ensure the integrity of the voting process.”\n\nUnder his proposal, lawmakers would meet to either “accept or reject election results” following primary and general elections. If legislators reject the results, any qualified voter “may file an action in the Superior Court to request that a new election be held,” according to the bill.\n\nFillmore said lawmakers should possess authority as “representatives of the people” to review the vote count. But, he said, “if there’s a problem, we’re not overturning anything. We’re just trying to put the skids on it and say, ‘This has to be adjudicated.’ “\n\nCurrently, in Arizona, the secretary of state certifies the statewide election results, which also are signed by the governor, state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also would eliminate the state’s widely used early voting-by-mail program and prohibit officials from requiring voters to wear masks at polling places.\n\nFifteen other lawmakers have cosponsored Fillmore’s bill, including state Rep. Mark Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed his bid to become Arizona’s election chief.\n\nFinchem did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n\n“The fact that (Arizona lawmakers) are willing to put their names on these democracy-ending bills is a sign of where we’re going to go if we don’t, as a country, start speaking out against this stuff,” Gulotta said.\n\nArizona – a state President Joe Biden flipped by fewer than 11,000 votes – has been at the forefront of brazen attempts by Trump loyalists to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate last year commissioned an error-plagued hand count of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix.\n\nThe review, undertaken by a Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas, affirmed Biden’s win, but election officials widely discredited the company’s methods and most of its conclusions. The firm recently shut down.\n\nThe state will hold one of the marquee US Senate contests this year as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection to a full term. Kelly, one of the chamber’s most vulnerable incumbents, won a special election in 2020 to fill the seat once held by late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.\n\nIt’s not clear that Fillmore’s measure will gain traction in the legislature.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers, but by narrow margins. As a result, a handful of GOP defectors can sink legislation pushed by others in their party. Last year, a GOP proposal that would have allowed the state legislature to revoke presidential electors chosen through the popular vote and appoint its own slate failed.\n\nFillmore’s proposal – along with his recent remarks suggesting the state return to what he described as 1950s voting practices – sparked rebukes.\n\n“We need to get back to 1958-style of voting,” Fillmore said during a House committee meeting Wednesday – as he argued that voters should cast paper ballots, in person, on Election Day.\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, denounced the comments.\n\n“Republicans have started saying the quiet part out loud: their restrictive voting laws have nothing to do with promoting safe and accessible elections — they just want to drag us back to before the Civil Rights Movement,” Gabrielle Chew, the group’s vice president of communications, said in a statement.\n\nIn the interview with CNN, Fillmore said that by calling it a “1958 bill” he was describing the procedures he prefers, not an era. “In person, no electronics, on paper, count the ballots that day,” he added, ticking off his preferred voting rules.\n\nSo far this year, Arizona Republicans have introduced dozens of bills they say are needed to restore voter trust in elections.\n\nOne, approved by a House committee this week, would ban the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes. Another bill would create a new “bureau of elections” in the governor’s office with a $5 million budget and subpoena powers to “investigate allegations of fraud in any state county or local government election.” (It follows a proposal that Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis first advanced last November to establish a new elections police force with 52 employees.)'}}",96.25,1

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s foremost experts on infectious diseases, has at long last reached the end of his rope. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was hectoring him in a congressional hearing, when he said, “You are the lead architect responsible from the government, and now 800,000 people have died.”\n\nAs Fauci began his response, stressing masks and vaccines for the umpteenth time, Paul interrupted, “and you have advocated to make it coercive and done by force, and you’ve advocated it be done by mandate.”\n\nRising to high moral dudgeon, Paul resorted to sarcasm: “You have advocated that your infallible opinion be dictated by law.”\n\nFauci had had enough. He put Paul’s attacks into context – and the context is dark.\n\n“I have threats upon my life,” he said. “Harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci then got into specifics, and they are chilling: “Just about three or four weeks ago, on December 21, a person was arrested who was on their way from Sacramento to Washington, DC at a speed stop in Iowa. And the police asked him where he was going. And he was going to Washington, DC to kill Dr. Fauci. And they found in his car an AR-15 and multiple magazines of ammunition, because he thinks that maybe I’m killing people.”\n\nNow we know the threat of physical violence is real. The Capitol itself was the scene of a violent and vicious attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and grievously wounded by a gunman in 2017, and Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head at point blank range in 2011 by a man who murdered a federal judge and five others in the attack.\n\nBut Fauci took it one step further on Wednesday, offering a theory behind Paul’s attacks. He displayed screen shots he said were from one of Paul’s political websites, seeking to raise campaign donations from his attacks on Fauci.\n\nHaving been through more political song and dance than I care to recall, I think I can spot insincerity. Fauci’s response, I believe, was real. It was raw. And it was righteous.\n\nFauci is not infallible, but he is a dedicated public servant who has spent his long career trying to protect Americans from illness and death. He deserves tough questions, to be sure, and even criticism where warranted. But at a time when national security officials warn that, “We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists,” Paul seems to have crossed a line.\n\nThe fact the Rand Paul for Senate committee is raising money on a website called firefauci.org suggests that politics, rather than public health, might be part of the motivation of the junior senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe Senate has always had demagogues, liars and outliers who go too far. Fauci’s measured but heartfelt takedown should have been a Joseph Welch moment. Welch was the lawyer for the US Army when the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was spreading hysterical chargers that communists had infiltrated the army, along with the State Department, Treasury and even the White House.\n\nWhen McCarthy impugned a young lawyer from Welch’s firm, the soft-spoken, bespectacled Welch could take it no more. “Until this moment, senator,” he said, “I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” McCarthy was stunned into silence, as Welch continued, “Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nWelch’s response broke the fever. Six months later, McCarthy was formally censured by his Senate colleagues 67-22. Half of the Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn their fellow Republican.\n\nNot now. Paul’s rant against Fauci produced a strong and immediate condemnation from Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Thank you, first of all, for what you do,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to put your life at risk…. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt to score political points, to build a political power base around the denial of science and around personal attacks on you and your family.”\n\nBut where was the GOP condemnation of Paul? Nearly nonexistent.\n\nTo his credit, though, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah defended Fauci. “Some of what we do [in these hearings] is performing,” he said, in an apparent reference to Paul’s attack. “And some of what we do is to become informed.”\n\nHe went on to stress his appreciation for Fauci and the other scientists who were testifying. “I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people of our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians. Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost.”\n\nTwo cheers for Romney for defending Fauci and for labeling the attacks on him as political. But I do wish he had followed through and condemned his GOP colleague the way Republicans condemned McCarthy decades ago. Perhaps that’s too much to ask in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nPerhaps Romney has assessed that condemning Paul might have opposite effect of the censure of McCarthy; that if he were to condemn Paul the result would be a diminution of Romney’s political strength within the Trumpified GOP, while strengthening Paul even more.\n\nThat is a depressing thought, but likely accurate. So long as there is money to be raised, clicks to be earned, votes to be gained, we can expect power-hungry politicians to, well, be reckless and dangerous – even during a deadly pandemic. It seems that political decency is not as contagious as Omicron.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?520938-1/senate-committee-hearing-federal-response-covid-19', 'Headline': 'Senate HELP Committee Hearing on the Federal Response to COVID-19', 'Snippet': 'Dr. Anthony Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and other health officials testified at a Senate hearing on the B… September 30, 2021 Education and HHS Secretaries Testify on School ...', 'Full_text': ''}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fauci-says-sen-paul-s-attacks-kindle-crazies-who-have-n1287299', 'Headline': ""Fauci says Sen.

After the back-and-forth, Fauci could be heard saying, “What a moron. Jesus Christ.”\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” Tuesday evening, Fauci said public health officials “should be having to respond to tough questions.”\n\n“And yet, the only thing that came out of Sen.

Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on Tuesday.\n\n“Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed.

The only issue, as Fauci pointed out, is that his financial disclosure is public. “You are totally incorrect,” said a flabbergasted Fauci.\n\nMarshall went after Fauci hard on Tuesday, but no lawmaker has attacked him as consistently and ardently as Rand Paul. The anti-vax senator from Kentucky has not only bashed the nation’s top infectious disease expert as an egomaniacal tyrant destroying America, but as someone who is responsible for the disease existing in the first place. Fauci during the hearing shed some light on why Paul might be spreading lies about him.\n\n“Why would a senator want to do this?” Fauci said. “Go to Rand Paul’s website, and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here.

Such exchanges are now customary whenever Fauci appears before the Senate. He was particularly exasperated as ever on Tuesday given how Omicron is causing case rates to skyrocket. “We are here at a committee to look a virus now that has killed nearly 900,000 people,” Fauci said. “And the purpose of the committee was to try to get things out, how we can help the American public. And you keep coming back to personal attacks on me.”\n\nFauci eventually dropped the hammer, explaining that the harassment of his family and death threats against himself before recounting how a man who was arrested last month in Iowa was on his way from California to Washington, D.C., to kill Fauci and others. He wondered why a senator would tell lies to inspire such animosity against someone who is basically just sharing the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. The reason is because Paul thinks it’s good for him politically, and there’s no clearer proof than the billing his #FireFauci campaign gets on his website next to all those donation buttons.\n\nPaul has been one of the Republican Party’s most prolific superspreaders of Covid misinformation in addition to attacking Fauci. YouTube has removed several of Paul’s Covid videos for violating their policy on Covid misinformation, prompting Paul to announce earlier this year that he’s leaving the platform.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden administration suspends funding for Wuhan lab', 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that ...', 'Full_text': 'The Biden administration has suspended funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology following a monthslong review that determined that the Chinese research institute “is not compliant with federal regulations and is not presently responsible,” according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS, which conducted the review, also proposed barring the Wuhan Institute from doing business with the federal government going forward, according to the memo, which is dated to Monday and was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe lab has not received any federal funding from the US National Institutes of Health since July 2020, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe determination came after the research institute failed to provide the National Institutes of Health with requested documents amid reported safety concerns at the lab.\n\n“This action aims to ensure that WIV does not receive another dollar of federal funding,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The move was undertaken due to WIV’s failure to provide documentation on WIV’s research requested by NIH related to concerns that WIV violated NIH’s biosafety protocols.”\n\nIn Monday’s memorandum, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition concludes that the Wuhan Institute’s “disregard of the NIH’s requests” and the NIH’s conclusion that the institute’s research likely violated biosafety protocols present a risk that the institute “not only previously violated, but is currently violating, and will continue to violate, protocols of the NIH on biosafety.”\n\n“Therefore, I have determined that the immediate suspension of WIV is necessary to mitigate any potential public health risk,” the official, whose name is redacted, writes in the memo.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01566-0', 'Headline': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research - Nature', 'Snippet': 'NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research EcoHealth Alliance lost funding during the Trump administration, but can now proceed with its research — under extensive restrictions. By', 'Full_text': 'The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reinstated a grant to a highly scrutinized research organization that studies bat coronaviruses — but the agency has placed several stipulations on the scope of the research and on the organization’s accounting practices.\n\nThe move caps a years-long saga that has thrust the EcoHealth Alliance, a small non-profit organization in New York City, into the political fray for its collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In April 2020, after then-US-president Donald Trump hinted that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a WIV laboratory, the NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant. Its goal was to study how coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, jump from bats to humans. A few months later, the NIH reinstated and immediately suspended the award until certain conditions were met that, at the time, EcoHealth said were impossible to complete.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature applaud the renewal, adding that this type of research is essential to avert the next pandemic. They claim that the NIH’s termination and subsequent suspension were politically motivated, and that, although long overdue, this renewal ends — for now — a drama-filled exchange between the agency and EcoHealth.\n\n“It’s about goddam time,” says Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, who organized researchers to push back against EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020. “The integrity of science requires a barrier against political interference,” he says.\n\nThe NIH “routinely considers processes and measures for strengthening [its] oversight over federal funds” and has been working with EcoHealth to strengthen its “administrative processes to meet NIH’s expectations”, says Amanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Washington DC.\n\nLengthy list of conditions\n\nAlthough the organization will now be able to continue its bat coronavirus research for the first time since the saga began, the NIH placed an extensive list of restrictions on the four-year, US$2.9-million award. None of the researchers who spoke to Nature had ever seen a grant with so many stipulations.\n\nAmong other things, EcoHealth is specifically forbidden from performing any in-country research in China, including with the WIV, or collecting any new samples from vertebrates — such as bats. The revised grant also mandates greater scrutiny of EcoHealth’s finances and accounting practices, driven in part by a federal watchdog report, released in January, finding that EcoHealth had misreported about $90,000 in expenses. The report also faulted the NIH for improperly terminating EcoHealth’s grant.\n\nFurthermore, EcoHealth will be forbidden from performing any work that is deemed by the NIH’s parent organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to have the potential to enhance the virulence or transmission of a virus. This restriction stems, in part, from criticism that research done at the WIV and funded by an EcoHealth subaward qualified as ‘gain of function’ research.\n\nDisputed research\n\nCongressional Republicans have alleged that this research, which involved attaching spike proteins from wild bat coronaviruses to an unrelated virus to determine whether the wild pathogens could infect human airway cells, should have undergone HHS review. Anthony Fauci, then-director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the agency concluded that these experiments did not meet the bar to undergo such review, and noted that the WIV did not intend to enhance the viruses.\n\nTens of thousands of people exposed to bat coronaviruses each year\n\nVirologists say this type of research is essential for developing vaccines and therapeutics against emerging pathogens and for understanding how likely a pathogen is to spark a pandemic. The NIH and HHS have been finalizing guidance that will probably tighten the oversight of such research in the United States.\n\n“I don’t know if any other single grantee from NIH has been subjected to this level of oversight,” says Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. Yet he is “positive and optimistic” about the grant restart, despite all the restrictions. A key priority for the newly released funds will be analysing nearly 300 partial or complete genomes of SARS-related coronaviruses from samples that the organization collected before the funding halt, he says.\n\nThird rail of virology\n\nThese restrictions seem reasonable, in light of the enormous public attention to and scrutiny of gain-of-function research, says Lawrence Gostin, a health-law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Still, Gostin says he is surprised the agency restarted its funding for EcoHealth, given that it has been the “third rail of politics” the past few years.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, says she is pleasantly surprised to see the grant renewed, but worries about the “terrible precedent” that the NIH set by “arbitrarily” terminating an award on the basis of “unfounded rumours” regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. She hopes that these same restrictions will not apply to other scientists doing similar work, but is encouraged by the number of research groups that are now studying coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/18/bu-lab-wasnt-required-to-clear-potentially-controversial-study-with-nih-director-says/', 'Headline': 'BU lab wasn’t required to clear Covid study with NIH, director says', 'Snippet': 'The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the NIH ...', 'Full_text': ""The director of a Boston University laboratory that conducted potentially controversial research on the viruses that cause Covid-19 said his institution didn’t clear the work with the National Institutes of Health because it wasn’t funded by the federal agency.\n\nRonald Corley said the research, which was designed to explore what makes some SARS-CoV-2 viruses more pathogenic than others, was paid for with money from the university itself. The work was approved by the institutional biosafety committee of BU’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, and by Boston’s Public Health Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists from the BU facility posted results from their work in a preprint, a study that has yet to go through peer review. The British tabloid The Daily Mail published an explosive article about the work on Monday, suggesting the group had fabricated a more dangerous version of the SARS-2 Omicron variant.\n\nIn response to questioning from STAT, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which had awarded two grants to the research group, said on Monday that it should have been informed about the nature of the work beforehand, in order for a review to be conducted.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nEmily Erbelding, director of NIAID’s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, said that is the policy set out in what’s known as the P3CO framework, which lays out the rules for work that could lead to enhancement of dangerous pathogens.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What we would have wanted to do is to talk about exactly what they wanted to do in advance, and if it met what the P3CO framework defines as enhanced pathogen of pandemic potential, ePPP, we could have put a package forward for review by the committee that’s convened by HHS, the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. That’s what the framework lays out and that’s what we would have done,” she said.\n\nBut the policy only applies to work of this type that is funded by the federal government. And NIAID money was not used for this research, Corley said.\n\nSome funding from NIAID went towards work that might be considered foundational to the questioned research. Corley said the team used some of the federal funds to develop a system for making plasmids it would need to do the later work.\n\nHe acknowledged it can be difficult to see where lines are drawn, when research groups are using different pots of money to fund their work.\n\n“It is a murky world, but in our view because the funding was not supporting the work that was supported in this paper, that it wasn’t necessary to report it to NIH,” he said.\n\nSTAT asked the NIAID if it was satisfied with Boston University’s response. The agency’s response, received by email on Tuesday evening, did not directly answer the question, though it indicated the situation is still being investigated.\n\n“NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the HHS Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO framework),” the statement said.\n\nCorley also challenged the notion that the work done by scientist Mohsan Saeed and colleagues was what is known as “gain of function” research. The group created a hybrid or chimeric virus — in which the spike protein of an Omicron version of SARS-2 was fused to a virus of the Wuhan strain, the original version that emerged from China in 2020. Omicron viruses first emerged in late 2021 and have since splintered into multiple different subvariants.\n\nThe purpose of the work was to see if the mutations in the Omicron spike protein were responsible for the lower rate of severity caused by Omicron viruses.\n\nThe testing actually showed, though, that the chimeric virus was more lethal to a type of lab mice than Omicron itself, killing 80% of the mice infected. But the original Wuhan strain killed 100% of mice it was tested in. That suggests that the spike protein itself is not responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-2 viruses, Corley said.\n\nHe noted that because the chimeric virus was less dangerous in mice than the original strain, this work could not be characterized as gain of function research. That is unlikely to assuage critics of the work, who may argue that the Wuhan strain is not the right benchmark to use as a comparison, given that it no longer circulates. The chimeric virus was more pathogenic than the currently circulating SARS-2 viruses, which are Omicron variants.\n\nBut it is important to note that the severity in the species of mice used in the experiment is not reflective of what happens in people. All of the mice exposed to the original SARS-2 viruses died. Less than 1% of people who contracted those viruses died.\n\nCorley said that BU safety protocols require that if researchers produce a pathogen that is more virulent than the Wuhan strains, they must immediately report it to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Saeed’s study protocol further stipulated that if such an event occurred, he would immediately stop the work and destroy the viruses, Corley noted.\n\nSTAT approached Saeed for an interview but he did not respond to the request.\n\nCorley said the principal investigators of the study — Saeed is one of two — spoke Tuesday with their program managers at the NIH.\n\n“They support the work that we’re doing and we certainly want to make sure that we are on comfortable ground,” Corley said.\n\n— This article has been updated with a comment from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/covid-origins-researchers-house-subcommittee-hearing/index.html', 'Headline': 'Scientists at House hearing refute claims they were bribed and ...', 'Snippet': 'Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei, Province on January 11 ...', 'Full_text': 'Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic said they aimed to use a hearing Tuesday to set the record straight on Republicans’ claims that Drs. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins steered scientists investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic away from the idea that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn a report released in advance of the hearing, Democrats highlighted sworn testimony by authors of the “Proximal Origin” paper that was published in March 2020 in the journal Nature – the paper that first concluded that the pandemic was most likely caused by a viral spillover event from animals to humans.\n\nThat testimony, they said, shows that Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British biomedical scientist who was then director of the Wellcome Trust health research charity and is now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, organized and led the scientific effort that produced both that paper and the February conference call that laid the groundwork for it, rather than Fauci or Collins. Fauci was then head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Collins was head of the National Institutes of Health. Both played critical roles in the nation’s pandemic response.\n\nThe conference call and the paper have become fodder for conspiracy theories claiming that Fauci and Collins pressured scientists to abandon the “lab leak” theory in favor of the natural origins hypothesis.\n\nDr. Kristian Andersen, who studies the genetics of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute, testified Tuesday that in the early days of the pandemic, he first thought the virus that causes Covid-19 had genomic features that might have pointed to laboratory manipulation.\n\n“My initial hypothesis was that SARS-CoV-2 was likely an engineered virus,” Andersen told the committee. “This was based on limited data and preliminary analyses where I had observed features that appeared to be unique.”\n\nHe shared those early concerns with Fauci, who advised him to draft a scientific paper outlining his theory. But Andersen said he changed his mind after learning more about these kinds of viruses.\n\n“We soon discovered that those features are readily found in related coronaviruses, and the virus itself looks to be a clear product of natural selection and not actual engineering,” he said.\n\nHe said scientists often adjust their thinking in the face of evidence. It’s not a flip-flop but how the scientific process works.\n\nAndersen, who said he found his name on online “kill lists” because of allegations that he was part of a coverup, also disputed allegations that he and his co-authors were bribed to change their public statements with promises of grant money.\n\n“It has also been suggested that a grant awarded to myself and colleagues from five different countries was a quid pro quo for changing our conclusions. These allegations are false,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee weren’t happy with those explanations.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, pressed Andersen to explain the change in his thinking.\n\n“Within a matter of days, something changed,” she said, between Andersen’s emails and calls to Fauci in late January 2020 and the February 1, 2020, conference call with about a dozen other researchers from around the world. “And that’s what this committee is trying to get to the bottom of. What happened within that three-day period between the conference call and the paper that all of a sudden you did a 180, and it couldn’t possibly come from a lab?” she asked. “What happened in those three days?”\n\nDr. Robert Garry, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tulane University, explained that they examined the genomes of other coronaviruses.\n\n“Well, we examined the genomes more closely. We looked at other coronaviruses. And there was some new data that came. There was the data come from the scientific literature,” he said.\n\nGarry said the publication of a similar coronavirus isolated from animals called pangolins showed some of the same changes as the virus that eventually infected humans.\n\n“It was a very important piece of data, because it showed that a lot of the theories about the virus having been engineered or put together in a laboratory were not true, because here was a virus in nature that had a receptor-binding domain with exactly” the same features, he said.\n\nAndersen said the genetic adaptation that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans was “suboptimal,” suggesting to him that it was of natural origin. If the virus had been engineered in a lab, he said, the changes probably would have been more precise.\n\nAndersen also pushed back on the timeline repeated by Republicans on the committee: He said he didn’t change his mind in three days but within about 45 days, as he drafted the Nature paper.\n\nBoth scientists said that if convincing evidence were to emerge that supported the theory that the virus came from lab manipulation, they would consider it.\n\n“It is still my opinion that there is no credible scientific evidence for a lab-based origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Garry said.\n\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican physician from Pennsylvania, asked how some US intelligence agencies – namely the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – had concluded that the virus probably came from a lab.\n\n“Dr. Andersen, you also said in your testimony, ‘we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ and yet two conclusions by the Department of Energy and the FBI directly contradict your position. How do you bring that together?” Joyce said.\n\n“I think you could say that our conclusions completely contradict their conclusions, too,” Andersen said. “I think it’s important to understand that we’re looking at different things here. You’re talking about the intelligence community. If you look at the scientific literature, the scientific evidence for this pointing to a single market in the middle of Wuhan is overwhelming.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, an ER doctor who is ranking member of the committee, said that months of the panel’s work had been a biased effort that had shed no additional light on the pandemic’s origins but had sown mistrust in science and the nation’s scientists.\n\n“We have undertaken all of this work, but to what end? Has targeting these researchers and probing the publication of this paper meaningfully advanced our efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics?” he asked.\n\n“Or has it been about fishing for evidence to prove their confirmation bias, their theories with a goal of advancing a predetermined partisan narrative targeting Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins and our nation’s scientists and public health officials.”\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, chided her Republican colleagues for feeding public hatred of scientists and public servants.\n\n“I am so offended by some of the things I’ve heard today, of baseless allegations against our nation’s scientists, our public health experts, including Drs.

NIH verified to the Bulletin that the letters were authentic.\n\nA letter from NIH to EcoHealth staff, also dated Aug. 19, said the NIH is taking action because EcoHealth did not include terms and conditions on its sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including a requirement that EcoHealth Alliance be allowed access to the institute’s records and financial statements. “NIH has determined that [Wuhan Institute of Virology’s] refusal to provide the requested records, and [EcoHealth’s] failure to include the required terms in [the] subaward agreement represent material failures to comply with the terms of award,” the letter said.\n\nBetween June 2017 and May 2019, scientists working on EcoHealth’s grant tested genetically engineered coronaviruses with the backbone of one virus and the spike proteins—which bind to host cells—of another on mice that expressed human cell receptors. In one case, the NIH reported last fall, one of the chimeric viruses caused mice to become “sicker.” EcoHealth reports show that in the infection experiments, conducted in years four and five of the grant, chimeric viruses replicated faster in mice lungs and killed a higher percentage of mice than the unmodified virus. Last fall, the NIH said that EcoHealth was supposed to report the increased viral growth to the agency “immediately” to assess whether further biosafety measures were necessary.\n\nThe NIH said the Wuhan institute’s experiments under the EcoHealth grant involved viruses that were too genetically distant to have evolved to become SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But some critics of so-called gain-of-function experimentation—in which pathogens are enhanced in way that makes them, say, more transmissible—have said last fall’s revelations point to risky research projects being undertaken at the laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the first reported cases of COVID were reported. Research published recently in Science points to the pandemic having sprung from a seafood market in the city where animals that could have harbored coronavirus infections were kept. That research has served as a new focus of controversy, as researchers argue over whether it does or does not greatly reduce (or even eliminate) the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic started with the leak of a virus from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth has not responded to a request for comment about NIH’s decision to partially terminate its grant.\n\nAccording to the new NIH letters, EcoHealth can work with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to revise the grants without involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If that is not possible, the NIH will ask that the grant be “bilaterally terminated.” Should a reworked grant be possible, the agency will add new terms to it, including increased NIH oversight over EcoHealth for at least three years and increased reporting requirements for the nonprofit. The nonprofit will also be required to visit its sub-awardees every six months to ensure compliance with the grant.'}, 7: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/extremely-disconcerting-nih-didnt-track-us-funds-going-to-chinese-virus-research-watchdog-finds-004808475.html', 'Headline': ""'Extremely disconcerting': NIH didn't track U.S. funds going to ... - Yahoo"", 'Snippet': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a new government ...', 'Full_text': 'The National Institutes of Health failed to provide adequate oversight of an American organization that funded controversial research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, according to a new government report that is sure to raise new questions about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report is evidence of “major failures in past NIH oversight of high-risk research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright told Yahoo News in an email.\n\nIssued by the inspector general of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the new report says nothing about the origins of the coronavirus. For the most part, it concerns research that took place well before the first cases of what came to be known as SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in China in late 2019.\n\nBut it does note that the American organization in question, the EcoHealth Alliance, should have been more rigorously scrutinized by federal officials regarding assurances that its partner lab in Wuhan was not using U.S. funds to conduct gain-of-function research, which boosts viruses to study how they might evolve in nature.\n\n“The entire picture starts to look extremely disconcerting,” mathematical biologist Alex Washburne told Yahoo News. He said that a project on coronaviruses originating in bats, for which the EcoHealth Alliance had given a grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “was clearly gain-of-function research.”\n\nRepublicans seized on the findings, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — a skeptic of virtually every aspect of the official coronavirus narrative — charging that the NIH “failed to conduct adequate oversight.”\n\nChina hawks will also be emboldened, accusing President Biden of not being forceful enough with the East Asian superpower.\n\nBut it is the NIH that is bound to face the most intense scrutiny. In a Twitter message, House Republicans promised that “oversight & accountability” are coming to the federal biomedical establishment, which has been celebrated by some but demonized by others.\n\nThe new report is likely to feature prominently in hearings they plan to hold.\n\nPolitics aside, Wednesday’s report raises important questions about how federal funds are monitored when they flow to foreign governments and organizations. Though the context is different, similar questions have been asked about the billions of dollars in U.S. military and civilian support to Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a damning indictment of N.I.H.,” Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin told the New York Times.\n\nThe new report examines a series of grants — $8 million total, awarded during both the Obama and Trump administrations — to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that subsequently sent a total of $598,611 to the Wuhan virology lab between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, Christi Grimm, found that the “NIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth’s compliance with some requirements” to report research being conducted in Wuhan with U.S. funds.\n\n“Deficiencies in complying with those procedures limited NIH and EcoHealth’s ability to effectively monitor Federal grant awards and subawards to understand the nature of the research conducted, identify potential problem areas, and take corrective action,” Grimm concluded.\n\nThe NIH “raised concerns” about some of the research EcoHealth was funding in China but ultimately did not put a halt to any of the work, Grimm wrote in her 64-page report. Crucially, EcoHealth failed to produce a progress report about its subgrants in the summer of 2019, just months before the advent of the coronavirus.\n\nDespite these concerns, EcoHealth continues to work with the federal government; the organization was recently the recipient of $3 million from the Department of Defense to study viruses in the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement, EcoHealth said it “welcomes” the inspector general’s “oversight and collaborated fully and transparently with this audit.” The organization also provided point-by-point responses to the inspector general’s findings that defended its work in China.\n\nSince the first months of the pandemic, EcoHealth Alliance has been at the center of both legitimate and conspiratorial inquiries into how, and where, the coronavirus originated. Although it was originally thought that the virus originated at a wildlife market, no explanation has been sufficiently convincing to allow for anything approaching scientific consensus.\n\nOne attempted explanation is the so-called lab leak theory, which claims that the virus escaped from a laboratory — with the Wuhan Institute of Virology being the most likely candidate — into the general population. The hypothesis was initially dismissed as a conspiracy theory but has since been acknowledged as plausible by many experts.\n\nEvidence, however, remains circumstantial, and most scientists subscribe to a model of pathogenesis involving an animal-to-person “spillover.” Ebola and HIV took the same route to becoming infectious diseases in the human population.\n\nWednesday’s report could invigorate investigators who continue to believe that China is hiding crucial evidence, including about a potential accident.\n\nWhen the pandemic began, EcoHealth president Peter Daszak argued that criticizing the zoonotic spillover hypothesis — that is, the notion that the coronavirus came from an animal, possibly one sold at a wildlife market — would only stoke xenophobia.\n\nDaszak compelled members of the scientific community to sign a letter, published in February 2020 in the Lancet — one of the world’s most esteemed medical journals — criticizing the suggestion that a laboratory accident (a not-uncommon occurrence in either China or the West) could have been involved.\n\n“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the letter said. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”\n\nBut after the extent of EcoHealth Alliance’s work in China became known in 2021, the Lancet had to publish an addendum acknowledging Daszak’s potential conflict of interest in defending China.\n\nThe new report comes as House Republicans prepare to probe several aspects of the nation’s pandemic response, including how the virus originated. Among the lawmakers named to the committee is far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has suggested that the coronavirus was the result of a bioweapons experiment. She has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of complicity in those experiments — of which no evidence exists — and called for his firing as the nation’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nFauci, who retired at the end of last year, has defended working with Chinese partners. But he has also conceded that much about how the virus came to be remains unknown.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China has been at the centre of the debate over COVID-19’s origins. ... NIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research. The NIH’s dealings with ...', 'Full_text': 'Researchers are upset over a new policy released by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tighten oversight of its ‘subawards’. These are funds that a primary grant recipient can give to a collaborator to perform research on their behalf. The biomedical funder’s policy, set to go into effect on 1 October, specifies that foreign subaward recipients, in particular, will be subject to extra scrutiny.\n\nForeign collaborators will have to provide copies of all relevant laboratory notebooks, data and documentation to the primary recipient every few months. The NIH also reserves the right to request access to this supporting documentation as part of its oversight responsibilities.\n\nNIH reinstates grant for controversial coronavirus research\n\nThe NIH’s dealings with foreign researchers have drawn attention as debate rages over whether the COVID-19 pandemic started with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 passing from animals to humans or from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, which is located in the city where early cases were detected.\n\nThe non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York City, has been especially scrutinized. It had received NIH funds to study coronaviruses, and the WIV received a subaward on this grant to study bat coronaviruses in the wild and their potential to infect people. Part of this work involved creating hybrid bat coronaviruses, which some critics have decried as risky ‘gain of function’ research. (On the basis of EcoHealth’s grant application, the NIH determined that this study didn’t meet the bar for risky research.)\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature worry that the change to the NIH’s subawards policy will have a chilling effect on international collaborations; foreign researchers might forgo partnerships because of the requirements. They also say that scientists will have to spend an unreasonable amount of time on administrative tasks to comply with the policy.\n\nThe policy is “heavy handed” and disrespectful to international collaborators, says Sheela Shenoi, an infectious-disease physician at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “It suggests that international collaborators need additional oversight — that they don’t have capacity to do their own research in a rigorous and robust way.”\n\nAmanda Fine, a spokesperson for the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, responds that this provision “empowers primary recipients to obtain, on a regular basis, records and data from foreign subrecipients without having to worry that they will not be able to access materials when needed”. She adds: “As part of high-quality science, there should be a free flow of information, documents and data.”\n\nUnder fire\n\nThe NIH has come under fire from federal auditors for, among other things, its handling of the EcoHealth grant. When it first funded EcoHealth, the NIH instructed the organization to report any evidence of unexpected transmissibility or virulence of the hybrid viruses. A progress report from EcoHealth was two years late owing to a miscommunication and a technical glitch, the organization has said. Federal auditors have criticized the NIH for not pursuing the late report and recommended that the agency intensify its monitoring of foreign subaward recipients.\n\nThe shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ research\n\nThe NIH terminated EcoHealth’s grant in 2020, but then said it would reinstate it if EcoHealth could meet certain conditions, including obtaining the WIV’s lab notebooks. In part because EcoHealth was unable to do so, last August the NIH terminated the subaward altogether.\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, responds that oversight of federally funded research is important, but that the subaward policy might have unintended consequences that are counter to its mission. “This might lead to countries cutting collaborative ties with US scientists, rather than handing over their laboratory notebooks,” he says. “This would weaken America’s pandemic preparedness at the very time when we need to be developing partnerships in regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate.”\n\nConcerns voiced\n\nResearchers have condemned the policy’s focus on foreign subrecipients. Stefano Bertuzzi, chief executive of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington DC, says he supports extra accountability and oversight for subawards, but he is “puzzled by why only foreign entities are singled out”.\n\nA virologist from Brazil, who requested anonymity out of fear that their chances of receiving funding could be harmed, says the policy adds a layer of bureaucracy, crafted with politics — not science — in mind.\n\n‘Heinous!’: Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions\n\nIn addition to concerns about international partnerships, Gerald Keusch, associate director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Boston University in Massachusetts, says that the policy imposes an administrative burden without providing more funding to meet the requirements. Keusch organized researchers to protest EcoHealth’s grant termination in 2020.\n\nFor some researchers, this isn’t a trivial matter. Oleksandr Zeziulin, a specialist in drug abuse and mental health at the Ukrainian Institute on Public Health Policy in Kyiv, says that, because of Russia’s invasion last year, Ukraine has been struggling with constant power outages. “During the winter, we were struggling with our normal schedule, and we’re expecting the same next winter, given Russia’s attacks on power plants,” says Zeziulin, who is a subrecipient of a grant with Shenoi. “If this policy will require an extra 10% of our time, I think it’s going to be [difficult], given the situation we’re in.”\n\nNot all researchers think the policy is unreasonable, however. David Relman, a microbiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, says it addresses concerns that “US expectations and standards for research reproducibility and transparency may not be shared elsewhere in the world”. But he has concerns that it might discourage international collaborations and worries that it’s unclear which elements of lab notebooks would need to be shared. He calls on the NIH to clarify this provision and to clearly communicate to the research community the motivations and goals of the policy.\n\nThe ambiguity could mean that the policy will face legal challenges in some countries, says the Brazilian virologist. Many researchers work on several overlapping research projects from various funders, and some countries carefully safeguard data — for instance, biodiversity data in Brazil — that will be difficult to keep separate.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the policy until 26 June, but it’s unclear whether it will make revisions based on feedback. Fine says: “These changes have been made, they are not proposed.”'}, 9: {'URL': 'https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/', 'Headline': ""NIH director Francis Collins wanted a 'take-down' to stifle ... - STAT"", 'Snippet': 'In October 2020, the U.S. needed scientific debate on how best to control Covid-19. NIH director Francis Collins tried to quash it.', 'Full_text': 'This week, emails released through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Institute for Economic Research revealed what I see as worrisome communication between Francis Collins, Anthony Fauci, and others within the National Institutes of Health in the fall of 2020. At issue was the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter written in October 2020 and eventually signed by thousands of scientists. It argues that Covid-19 policy should focus on protecting the elderly and vulnerable, and largely re-open society and school for others.\n\nAt the time, Americans would have benefited from a broad debate among scientists about the available policy options for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, and perhaps a bit of compromise. The emails tell us why that isn’t what we got.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn email written by Collins, the director of the NIH, which was addressed to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several others read:\n\nCollins appeared on television this week to confirm that the email was authentic, and that he stood by the message. At the time, he believed the Great Barrington Declaration idea of focused protection would result in more deaths than the alternative view of one-size-fits all restrictions. Collins also confirmed that he believed the three authors of the declaration were “fringe” scientists.\n\nOctober 2020, when Collins wrote that email, was a time fraught with uncertainty. Positive results from Pfizer’s ongoing vaccine trial were still four weeks away. Many Americans were fatigued with ongoing restrictions, either imposed by governments or self-imposed. And two dueling documents — the Great Barrington Declaration and the John Snow Memorandum — were released and garnered thousands of signatures. The declaration argued for focused protection and permitting many people to return to normal life. The memorandum favored prolonged one-size-fits all restrictions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the time, I did not take sides, and urged public dialogue between scientists who held both views. We needed “a Covid policy response that engages with people who hold views and perspectives different than our own,” I wrote then.\n\nWhat concerns me about the NIH director’s email and his interview on television is that he appeared unwilling to have this dialogue. Collins’s day job does not make him arbiter of scientific truth, the Pope for all scientists. On questions of unprecedented pandemic policy, he is surely entitled to his opinion — as we all are — but his is just one opinion of many.\n\nWhen it comes to lockdowns or school closures, the answer to the question of whether the benefits exceed the harms and, if so, under what conditions, is far from certain, and scientists will continue to study this for decades. As a good scientist, Collins should have recognized the massive uncertainty around these policies.\n\nCollins’s response to a memo signed by thousands of scientists should not have been to call for an immediate and devastating take down, but to use his pulpit as NIH director to hold a series of public discussions and dialogues. In a world where scientists were trapped in their own homes for months, a series of dialogues — even virtual ones — made available for the broader scientific community, policy makers, and the public would have benefited us all.\n\nIt is possible that through the heat of dialogue, weak premises of the argument for focused protection might have been revealed. But it is also possible that the idea might have attracted even more scientists to devise creative ways to achieve the goal, and who would have recognized the gargantuan trade-offs involved in pandemic policy to date.\n\nIt’s also possible that compromises might have been struck. One tenet of the Great Barrington Declaration was that schools should reopen immediately and broadly. In hindsight, it is now clear that reopening schools could have been done safely, as was done in many European nations in 2020 and in the U.S. in the fall of 2021, even before vaccines became available for children. A public forum between scientists might not have accepted all of the reasoning in the declaration, but might have reached a vital compromise, which would have benefitted millions of children, particularly poor or disadvantaged children — and their parents. Unfortunately, we failed them all.\n\nA dialogue might also have led to better strategies for nursing home residents, the group most decimated by Covid-19. The U.S. did not — but could have — launched a large, registry-based randomized trial in this cohort, similar to the U.K.’s recovery trial. Such a trial might have helped vaccinate more of these at-risk individuals sooner and, with the first hint of vaccine efficacy in November 2020, all participants could have been crossed over to receive vaccines. Other intense strategies to aggressively test nursing home workers may have been proposed and received unanimous support.\n\nJeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, and I called for dialogue and debate among scientists without demonization in April 2020. I’m disappointed to see a few months later that the NIH director, a man uniquely positioned to foster such a debate, had actively sought to thwart and discredit scientists with alternative ideas to the pandemic response. His ad-hominem comment that the authors were “fringe” was unnecessary and unhelpful. In the weeks that followed, more and more mud would be slung against the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, as well as against scientists who held alternative policy views, and favored more and stronger restrictions. The vitriol ensured that the country would not have the dialogue it so desperately needed.\n\nI must admit that I don’t know what would have happened had scientists been more willing to talk to each other. I believe that the world of social isolation — a world of seeing each other through the Post-it-sized Zoom squares — led to dehumanization and irrational hatred, which led to two entrenched policy poles with little room for compromise.\n\nHad Collins, a man who has contributed greatly to science, chosen dialogue instead of contributing to animosity and combativeness, we might have been in a better place today.\n\nVinay Prasad is a hematologist-oncologist, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco, and author of “Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Evidence Harm People with Cancer” (Johns Hopkins University Press, April 2020).'}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp2305081', 'Headline': 'The Origins of Covid-19 — Why It Matters (and Why It Doesn’t)', 'Snippet': 'The WHO director-general im- ... failed to adequately oversee an EcoHealth Alliance grant for research into bat viruses at Wuhan Institute of Virology ... controversy has con-tinued.

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system.\n\nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\n\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66983060', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists behind mRNA Covid vaccines - BBC', 'Snippet': 'EPA.

But Katie and I kept pushing,"" Professor Wiseman told the BBC\'s Newshour programme.\n\nAsked about how the pair first reacted to hearing the news that they had won the prize, Professor Kaliko said she thought it was ""just a joke"" initially.\n\nIn a similar vein, Professor Weissman said: ""I was you know, sort of overjoyed and then disbelief, and a little bit suspecting that there was some anti-vaxxer playing a prank on us.""\n\n""But when we saw the announcement, we knew it was real and there was just a fantastic feeling.""\n\nAn mRNA Covid vaccine contains the genetic instructions for building one component - a protein - from the coronavirus.\n\nWhen this is injected into the body, our cells start producing lots of the viral protein.\n\nThe immune system recognises these as foreign so it attacks and has learned how to fight the virus, and therefore has a head start when future infections occur.\n\nThe big idea behind the technology is that you can rapidly develop a vaccine against almost anything - as long as you know the right genetic instructions to use.\n\nThis makes it far faster and more flexible than traditional approaches to vaccine development.\n\nThere are even experimental approaches using the technology that are teaching patients\' bodies how to fight their own cancers.\n\nScientists analyse a patient\'s tumour, look for abnormal proteins being produced by the cancer that are not in healthy tissue and develop a vaccine to target those and inject that into the patient.\n\nProfs Kariko and Weissman made the crucial breakthroughs that made mRNA vaccines happen.\n\nThe principle taps into normal human biology. RNA\'s role in our body is to convert the instructions that are locked away in our genetic code, or DNA, into the proteins that our body is built from.\n\nHowever, there were challenges. But by refining the technology, the researchers were able to produce large amounts of the intended protein without causing dangerous levels of inflammation that had been seen in animal experiments.\n\nThis paved the way for developing the vaccine technology for use in people.\n\nKatalin Kariko is now a professor at Szeged University in Hungary and Drew Weissman is still working as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPrevious Nobel winners'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/mrna-vaccines-may-make-unintended-proteins-there-s-no-evidence-harm', 'Headline': 'mRNA vaccines may make unintended proteins, but there’s no ... - AAAS', 'Snippet': 'Even after the billions of doses given during the pandemic, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines still hold surprises.

Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://time.com/6319654/nobel-prize-awarded-to-mrna-pioneers/', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize Awarded to Work Behind COVID-19 Vaccine | TIME', 'Snippet': 'Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020.

Their discovery led to the first approved mRNA vaccines, targeting the COVID-19 virus, in 2020. And that success is seeding mRNA-based strategies across a number of different conditions, including other infectious diseases as well as cancer.\n\nKariko’s husband answered the call from Stockholm early in the morning on Oct. 2 at their home in a Philadelphia suburb. She told nobelprize.org that she initially thought “somebody was just joking.” While she said the conversation involved detailed scientific information that would have been hard to fake, “you never know in these days,” she said.\n\nTrue to their long-time partnership, Kariko then called Weissman to break the good news. In fact, the early morning call likely reminded him of years of similar emails he and Kariko would exchange at dawn when they were working to crack the problem of turning mRNA into reliable therapies.\n\nThat collaboration began at the copy machine between their offices at the University of Pennsylvania. Kariko was obsessed with mRNA, which is the part of DNA that codes for proteins, convinced that it would be the key to developing new treatments for heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Few scientists at the time agreed, since RNA was much less stable than DNA, and despite years of dedicated, unflagging research, Kariko had little to show in the form of results.\n\nThen came the chance meeting with Weissman at the copier in 1997. Weissman is an immunologist and physician and had come to Penn from the National Institutes of Health to continue developing a vaccine against HIV. The more gregarious Kariko tried to sell her colleague on the merits of mRNA, and Weissman listened.\n\nTo make mRNA a useful tool for treating people, however, Kariko needed to find a way to suppress its tendency to aggravate the immune system, which ended up creating a dangerous inflammatory reaction and destroying the very mRNA that was supposed to be therapeutic. Their personalities couldn\'t be more different—according to Kariko, Weissman said she tended to zig and zag to generate ideas, while he preferred the more straightforward approach. Still, “we worked side by side,"" said Weissman. But their research wasn\'t popular, either with the leadership at the university, or with the scientific community. ""We couldn’t get funding [for our research] we couldn’t get publications [for our work], we couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said during a press briefing after the Nobel announcement. “RNA had failed in clinical trials, and pretty much everybody had given up on it.”\n\nBut the over the next decade or so, Kariko and Weissman tenaciously proved the doubters wrong. They eventually figured out that changing one portion of the mRNA code would make it less likely to stimulate the immune system. Not only that, the change also led cells in animals to produce more of the desired protein coded for by the mRNA—exactly what they needed to turn mRNA into a robust vaccine or other treatment.\n\nBut even when the scientists published what they thought was their ground-breaking finding in 2005, the scientific community barely noticed. Doubters still prevailed, and Kariko was “kicked out from Penn, and forced to retire,” she said. Eventually, she was hired by BioNTech, a German biotech that shared Kariko’s vision about the promise of mRNA technology. When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Penn did not directly address the circumstances of Kariko\'s leaving the university.\n\nThat faith was finally borne out when two mRNA-based vaccines, including one made by BioNTech and Pfizer and another by U.S. biotech Moderna, became the first to be authorized and approved to treat SARS-CoV-2, and remain the foundation for the pandemic response. Kariko’s conviction was finally justified—more than two decades later—that mRNA would make an efficient, and potentially more powerful platform for treating disease. Now, researchers are developing mRNA-based vaccines to target other infectious diseases such as mpox and influenza, and the strategy is even showing promise against cancer, as a way to train the immune system to recognize tumors. Because the technology is still so new, scientists are still learning about any side effects of the platform—mRNA vaccines have so far been linked to a slightly higher risk of some heart inflammation, for example—but given that millions of people have received the shots, so far the benefits appear to outweigh the risks.'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202941256/nobel-prize-goes-to-scientists-who-made-mrna-covid-vaccines-possible', 'Headline': 'Nobel Prize goes to scientists who made mRNA COVID vaccines possible', 'Snippet': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Full_text': 'A biochemist born in Hungary and an American immunologist have won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for research that led to the development of the two most important COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman met at copy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and collaborated for decades to try to find ways to use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to make vaccines.\n\nThe scientists discovered that modifying a chemical building block of mRNA kept the immune system from destroying the material and enabled it to instead stimulate protection against viruses.

The rapid development of these vaccines changed the course of the pandemic, providing protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nBut these vaccines would not have been possible it if weren’t for the pioneering work of this year’s winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine decades earlier.\n\nDr Katalin Karikó and Dr Drew Weissman, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, have been given the prestigious award for their discoveries into mRNA biology. The pair were the first to discover a way of modifying mRNA that allowed it to successfully be delivered to cells and replicated by them.\n\nTheir discovery was not only integral to COVID-19 vaccine development, but may also lead to the development of many other therapies – such as vaccines for cancer.\n\nLife’s work\n\nKarikó is a Hungarian biochemist and Weissman an American physician scientist. The two began working together in 1985 when Karikó was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where Weissman was already working as an immunologist. They had a shared interest in how mRNA could be used to make new therapies.\n\nMessenger RNA (better known as mRNA) is an essential molecule to life. It’s made in the body from our very own DNA in a process called translation. DNA is our special encoded handbook of instructions for manufacturing proteins, which are the building blocks for material in the body.\n\nOur mRNA copies and carries these genetic instructions from our DNA to our cells. The cells then make whatever protein they’ve been instructed to, such as haemoglobin which helps red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n\nKarikó and Weissman thought that if it was possible to commandeer this process, mRNA could be used to instruct cells to essentially make their own cures. But at the time they started working together, attempts by other researchers to do this had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe researchers faced two major challenges as they began their work. The first was being able to prevent the host from mounting an immune response against the modified mRNA. The second was being able to deliver the mRNA into the host safely without it degrading.\n\nTo understand how they overcame the first barrier, it’s important to understand mRNA’s structure. Normally, mRNA molecules contain four types of smaller molecules known as bases (nucleosides): A (adenine), U (uridine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). Different sequences of these bases can be strung together to produce the basis of an mRNA molecule.\n\nIn early experiments, Karikó and Weismann found that injecting normal mRNA molecules into mice led to an immune response. This meant the mouse’s immune system saw the new mRNA as an invading pathogen and the immune cells would destroy it, instead of replicating it.\n\nSo the researchers modified the U nucleoside to create a pseudouridine, a chemical compound which stabilises RNA’s structure. When they repeated their experiment with the modified mRNA, the mice exhibited no immune response.\n\nBut Karikó and Weismann still faced the second challenge of being able to deliver the bespoke mRNA without it degrading.\n\nThey decided to use lipids (a nanoparticle) to deliver it. These fatty chemical compounds are an essential part of the cell membrane, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. Specially created lipids allowed the mRNA molecules to be delivered without being degraded or broken down by the immune system.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s research had successfully eliminated the obstacles that had previously stood in the way of using mRNA clinically. Being able to instruct the body to replicate virtually any harmless protein could have potential for treating a range of diseases and even protect against viral infections.\n\nCOVID vaccines\n\nWhen their research was first published, it didn’t garner much attention. But in 2011, two biotech companies – Moderna and BioNTech – took notice and began research into mRNA medicines.\n\nIt’s no wonder why. Traditional vaccine production methods are time consuming, expensive and don’t work for every vaccine. But Karikó and Weissman’s work showed that synthetic mRNA could be made at a large scale.\n\nResearchers had already been working on developing mRNA vaccines before the pandemic, such as a vaccine for Ebola that didn’t receive much commercial interest. But in 2020, when COVID-19 began spreading around the globe, vaccines were needed quickly to offer protection.\n\nUsing the foundational work of Karikó and Weissman, scientists developed a bespoke mRNA sequence which mimicked the spike protein (which allows the virus to enter our cells). This produced a harmless COVID particle which our cells then replicated, allowing our bodies to protect us from severe COVID infections when it encountered the real virus.\n\nKarikó and Weissman’s discoveries years earlier were critical in making the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines possible. But these aren’t the only ways their work could be applied.'}, 8: {'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nobel-prize-medicine-1.6984244', 'Headline': 'Scientists who spurred development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving ...', 'Full_text': 'Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries they made at the University of Pennsylvania that enabled the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nKariko and Weissman were honoured for ""their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,"" the body said.\n\n""MRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 vaccines, have been administered over 13 billion times.

""I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.""\n\nKariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA.\n\nTogether with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNA\'s genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune system\'s radar.\n\n""We couldn\'t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,"" Weissman said on Monday. ""Pretty much everybody gave up on it.""\n\nMessenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body\'s production of proteins.\n\nThe technology breaks from established biotech medicines, generated in complex reactors by genetically modified living cells, then isolated and purified. Messenger RNA, by contrast, works like a software that can be injected into the body to instruct human cells to churn out the desired proteins. Prospective uses include drugs against cancer and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.\n\nPfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, and Moderna were able to develop mRNA vaccines based on the foundational work conducted by Kariko and Weissman, as well as other scientists, enabling a rapid response as a COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2020.\n\nSince that time, a vocal anti-vaccine movement has emerged. Olle Kämpe of the Karolinska Institute, responding to a reporter question, said the award would probably not sway those most resistant to receiving vaccines, but that, ""giving a Nobel Prize for this COVID-19 vaccine may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure it\'s very efficient and safe.""\n\nGunilla Karlsson Hedestam, also from the institute, said scientists must be transparent and communicate clearly to wider audiences. While the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were accelerated, she said, it was important for people to undertstand that the origins of the work enabling the development of mRNA vaccines date back to the 1990s.\n\nSir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca, said it was ""absolutely right that the ground-breaking work"" done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.\n\nPeace Prize revealed on Friday\n\nPrizes in physics, chemistry and literature will be announced this week, with the Nobel Peace Prize winner to be revealed on Friday. The economics prize is announced on Oct. 9.\n\nWinners of this year\'s Nobel Prizes will get an extra 1 million crowns compared to last year, partly because the Swedish crown has lost around 30 per cent of its value against the euro the past decade.

I'm chief data and AI officer at Moderna. mRNA is essentially an information molecule. It's encoded, a sequence of amino acids, which when they enter the cell in your body, it produces a protein and that protein can perform a variety of different functions in your body from curing a rare disease, potentially attacking cancer, or even a vaccine to battle of virus like we've seen with Covid.\n\nWhat's so fundamentally different about this approach from the typical pharmaceutical development is it's much more of a design approach. We're saying we know what we want to do. And then we're trying to design the right information molecule, the right protein, that will then have that effect in the body.\n\nAnd if you know anything about pharmaceutical development, it tends to be a very serial process. You know, you start with some kind of initial concept, some initial idea and you test it in Petri dishes or in, you know, small experiments. And then you move on to preclinical testing. And if all of that looks good, then you're finally moving off to, to human testing and you go through several different phases of clinical trials where phase three is the, the largest one where you're proving the efficacy of this drug.\n\nAnd that whole process from end to end can be immensely expensive, cost billions of dollars and take, you know, up to a decade to do that. And in many cases, it still fails. You know, there's countless diseases out there right now that have no vaccine for them, that have no treatment for them. And it's not like people haven't tried, it's just, they're, they're challenging.\n\nAnd so we built the company thinking about: how can we reduce those timelines? How can we target many, many more things? And so that's how I kind of entered into the company. You know, my background is in software engineering and data science. I actually have a PhD in what's called information physics—which is very closely related to data science.\n\nAnd I started when the company was really young, maybe a hundred, 200 people at the time. And we were building that early preclinical engine of a company, which is, how can we target a bunch of different ideas at once, run some experiments, learn really fast and do it again. Let's run a hundred experiments at once and let's learn quickly and then take that learning into the next stage.\n\nSo if you wanna run a lot of experiments, you have to have a lot of mRNA. So we built out this massively parallel robotic processing of mRNA, and we needed to integrate all of that. We needed systems to kind of drive all of those, uh, robotics together. And, you know, as things evolved as you capture data in these systems, that's where AI starts to show up. You know, instead of just capturing, you know, here's what happened in an experiment, now you're saying let's use that data to make some predictions.\n\nLet's take out decision making away from, you know, scientists who don't wanna just stare and look at data over and over and over again. But let's use their insights. Let's build models and algorithms to automate their analyses and, you know, do a much better job and much faster job of predicting outcomes and improving the quality of our, our data.\n\nSo when Covid showed up, it was really, uh, a powerful moment for us to take everything we had built and everything we had learned, and the research we had done and really apply it in this really important scenario. Um, and so when this sequence was first released by Chinese authorities, it was only 42 days for us to go from taking that sequence, identifying, you know, these are the mutations we wanna do. This is the protein we want to target.\n\nForty-two days from that point to actually building up clinical-grade, human safe manufacturing, batch, and shipping it off to the clinic—which is totally unprecedented. I think a lot of people were surprised by how fast it moved, but it's really… We spent 10 years getting to this point. We spent 10 years building this engine that lets us move research as quickly as possible. But it didn't stop there.\n\nWe thought, how can we use data science and AI to really inform the, the best way to get the best outcome of our clinical studies. And so one of the first big challenges we had was we have to do this large phase three trial to prove in a large number, you know, it was 30,000 subjects in this study to prove that this works, right?\n\nThat's a huge study. Covid had been flaring, um, infecting countless people. And we had to figure out: where do we run our studies? We're gonna pick a hundred locations in the US to run this study and we needed to balance finding places where we have kind of the right racial diversity that's the right makeup for the country.\n\nWe needed to balance… kind of practical concerns. If we need a, you know, the right size facility and clinical trial sites that can deliver quality data. And we need to find places where Covid has not already hit. So at the time New York, for example, was already heavily hit. And so it wouldn't be an ideal place to run a clinical study because we have to accrue cases of it.\n\nSo we had to find places that weren't quite yet hit, but places that we expected to actually, you know, surge, you know, maybe six weeks after the study started after people had been inoculated. So that's a really challenging problem we had to solve. And I wanna say, you know, we, we didn't do this all entirely internally.\n\nWe worked with countless external partners. And I can't tell you the number of different epidemiology models that we saw. It seemed like everybody was an epidemiologist all of a sudden. But we incorporated all that learning all that information into our internal decision making and used that to try to find: these are the optimal places that we should run this study.\n\nAnd then even while we were running this study, we were saying, how can we continue to optimize and do better? You know, we built real time analytics into our studies enrollment. So as patients or subjects enrolled into the study, were treated with our vaccine, we are monitoring the diversity of this: the age, the gender, and racial diversity to ensure that the final makeup of this study, when all said and done was representative of the US.\n\nWe got, I wanna say, maybe 80% of the way through the study. And we realized, look, we are not gonna meet our, our objectives because the level of volunteers aren't quite what we wanted. And so we made the, the really difficult decision to say, look, we need a throttle, some areas of the country and focus on outreach in different areas to get the right makeup so that the study was representative.\n\nAll told, it was about a year from when we, you know, started this journey on Covid to when we got the emergency use authorization for the vaccine—which again is really unprecedented for something that usually takes many years. And I'll say for myself personally, it was just such an amazing kind of emotional moment of, you know, I joined the company almost eight years earlier, not thinking necessarily I would ever use one of our own medicines because we weren't even doing vaccines at the time. But to have that injected in my arm and for my family to get it for my friends and everyone else to, to see that benefit and for so many other people in the world, was just an amazing moment for us.\n\nJennifer Strong: I Was There When... features stories from people who witnessed or created breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and computing.""}, 10: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03046-x', 'Headline': 'Pioneers of mRNA COVID vaccines win medicine Nobel - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Although COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.” Nature 622 , 228-229 (2023)', 'Full_text': 'This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to biochemist Katalin Karikó and immunologist Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccines have been administered billions of times, saved millions of lives and prevented millions of cases of severe COVID-19, said the Nobel committee.\n\nKarikó, who is at Szeged University in Hungary, and Weissman, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia (UPenn), paved the way for the vaccines’ development by finding a way to deliver genetic material called messenger RNA into cells without triggering an unwanted immune response.\n\nThey will each receive an equal share of the prize, which totals 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million).\n\nKarikó is the 13th female scientist to win a Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology (see ‘Nobel imbalance’). She was born in Hungary, and moved to the United States in the 1980s. “Hopefully, this prize will inspire women and immigrants and all of the young ones to persevere and be resilient. That’s what I hope,” she tells Nature.\n\nA new chapter\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and the Pfizer–BioNTech collaboration deliver mRNA that instructs cells to create copies of a protein that is found on SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, called the spike protein. This stimulates the body to make antibodies that target the protein, as well as triggering other immune responses.\n\nThe tangled history of mRNA vaccines\n\nFor decades, mRNA vaccines were considered unfeasible because the injection of mRNA into the body triggered an immune reaction that immediately broke down the mRNA. In the mid-2000s, working at UPenn, Karikó and Weissman demonstrated that swapping one type of molecule in mRNA, called uridine, with a similar one called pseudouridine bypasses the cells’ innate immune defences1.\n\n“I’m delighted to see them recognized,” says Robin Shattock, a vaccine scientist at Imperial College London who has worked on mRNA vaccines. “Their contribution was really fundamental in the success of the COVID-19 vaccines, and I think will underlie RNA technology for some time to come.”\n\n“They demonstrated that changing the type of the RNA nucleotides within the vaccine altered the way in which cells see it,” said John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist at Imperial College London, in a press statement for the UK Science Media Centre. “This increased the amount of vaccine protein made following the injection of the RNA, effectively increasing the efficiency of the vaccination: more response for less RNA.”\n\n“This discovery has opened a new chapter for medicine,” said Nobel committee member Qiang Pan Hammarström, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference after the prize announcement. “Investment in long-term basic research is very important.”\n\nVaccine revolution\n\nThere are now mRNA vaccines in development for a number of other diseases, including influenza, HIV, malaria and Zika.\n\n“It’s really like a revolution starting since the COVID pandemic,” says Rein Verbeke, an mRNA vaccine researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. He adds that Karikó and Weissman’s contributions were essential to the vaccines’ success during the pandemic, and beyond. “Their part was really crucial to the development of this platform.”\n\nA COVID-19 mRNA vaccine containing unmodified RNA, developed by CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, was widely seen as a flop after its mediocre performance in clinical trials.\n\nCOVID advances win US$3-million Breakthrough prizes\n\nAnother key component of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that surround the modified RNA and ease its entry into cells. Numerous scientists contributed to the development of LNPs, says Verbeke, and it would have been nice if the Nobel committee had also recognized their contributions to mRNA vaccines. The modification of mRNA and the development of LNPs “were the two major steps that were necessary to have mRNA vaccines working”, he says.\n\nMany people were involved in developing LNPs, however, and it would be difficult to single out any one contribution, says Pierre Meulien, who worked on using mRNA to trigger immune responses in the 1990s at Transgène, a small biotech firm near Strasbourg in France. Karikó and Weissman “really created the key to success of the whole enterprise around mRNA vaccines”, he adds.\n\nThe development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics is still in its infancy, says Shattock. Scientists and biotechnology companies are busy coming up with new applications for mRNA technology, from cancer treatments to next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Many teams are also working on improved ways of delivering mRNA. “What we see used today is not what’s going to be used in the future,” he says. “We’re at the beginning of an RNA revolution.”\n\nAlthough COVID-19 jabs put mRNA vaccines on the map, the technology’s impact is likely to reach far and wide, says Karikó. “It is just limitless.”'}}",99.0,1
