These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation.\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and effect of exposure to unreliable information while searching for information online, study 5 combines survey data with digital trace data. In this final randomized controlled trial (between-respondents study), we collected articles using the same article-selection protocol and, as in study 1, asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles within 72 h of publication and in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was required to search online using Google before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity, whereas the control group was not. For those in the treatment group, we collect the URLs that they visited and the top ten Google search engine results to which they were exposed by means of a custom-made browser plug-in that respondents consented to install. Over this 12 day study, we recruited 1,677 respondents living in the United States through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and presented them with three highly popular articles from mainstream and low-quality sources within 72 h of publication. Over the course of this study, 17 false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in the control (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and treatment (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents) groups. By asking the respondents in both the control and treatment groups to install a custom web extension that collected their web browsing behaviour, we were able to collect digital trace data associated with 73% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the treatment group and 91% of evaluations of false/misleading articles in the control group. This differential attrition was probably due to technical differences between the extension used by the treatment and control groups, but does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey across the groups (further analysis, including difference in means testing, is provided in the Methods). We still collected the survey results for all of the respondents regardless of compliance and used these responses for the analyses in Fig. 2b. We excluded non-compliant responses from our analysis only when we analysed the effect of the quality of search engine results. We excluded all non-compliant respondents in these analyses to limit possible selection effects, but these respondents were included in all of the other analyses.\n\nFigure 2a presents the proportion of the treatment group’s search queries about true and false/misleading articles that return at least one unreliable news source in their Google search engine results. To assess the reliability of a news source, we used classifications from the NewsGuard service, which provides reliability and trustworthiness scores from journalists available at the time of the study (August 2021). Sites with a score of below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score above 60 are deemed to be reliable; a histogram of NewsGuard scores for the majority of online news domains is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Information C. Figure 2a shows that search queries about true articles are much less likely to return unreliable news among search results than search queries about false/misleading articles (22.5 percentage point difference, F = 105.8, P < 0.0001). Only 15% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about true articles, whereas 38% of individuals are exposed to at least one unreliable news link when they search about false/misleading news.\n\nUsing evaluations from study 5, we measured the effect of searching online on the belief in false articles. Figure 2b presents the treatment effect (encouraged to search online) on the probability of believing misinformation using both a dichotomous outcome (rating a false/misleading story as true: 1, yes; 0, no), a seven-point ordinal scale of veracity and a four-point ordinal scale. Like the previous four studies, we found that those who search online about misinformation were more likely to believe false news stories to be true than those who did not. We found that the effect of SOTEN is greater than in the previous studies, which we suspect may be due to the fact that the search treatment is likely stronger in this study relative to the others given that we could verify compliance for full compensation. In this final study, searching online increased the probability that a respondent rated a false or misleading article as true by 0.107 (P = 0.0143, Cohen’s D = 0.21, n = 1,485). Searching online also increased the average score by 0.16 (P = 0.0434, Cohen’s D = 0.16, n = 1,485) on a four-point ordinal scale, but not on a seven-point ordinal scale (P = 0.201, Cohen’s D = 0.10, n = 1,485). We present the differential effect of SOTEN by political ideology in Extended Data Fig. 2 (explanation for how the ideology of each respondent and the ideological perspective of each article is measured can be found in Supplementary Information I and L).\n\nUsing digital trace data collected through the custom browser plug-in, we are able to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation among those exposed to unreliable and reliable information by search engines. To this end, we measured the effect of being encouraged to search online on the belief in misinformation for our control group and two subsets of the treatment group: those who were exposed to Google search engine results that returned unreliable results (defined as at least 10% of links coming from news sources with a NewsGuard score below 60) or very reliable results (defined as the first ten links coming only from sources with a NewsGuard score above 85). Roughly 42% of all evaluations in the treatment group fit in either of these two subsets; although subsetting the data in this way ignores 58% of the treatment group, we are interested in the effect of search among groups exposed to very different levels of information quality. Our next analysis looks at the whole set of responses. Across these two subsets, Fig. 2c shows that the probability that an individual believes false/misleading news stories to be true is substantially higher in the treatment group than the control group among respondents whose news exposure is composed of at least 10% unreliable news sites (n = 1,027, P = 0.0035, Cohen’s D = 0.29), but it is not higher among those in the treatment group who are only exposed to very reliable news sites (n = 940, P = 0.926, Cohen’s D = 0.01) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.147) in favour of the null hypothesis). These results are consistent with the theory that lower-quality search engine results can increase belief in misinformation by returning low-quality results. As further evidence, in Fig. 2d, we used the entire sample and calculated the probability of rating misinformation as true by quartile of the mean news quality across the top ten links returned by Google during the evaluation, leading to similar results. Figure 2d shows that respondents who are exposed to search engine results with the lowest-quality news are more likely to rate false/misleading news as true (n = 1,006, P = 0.0241) compared with those who are not asked to search, whereas those who are exposed to the highest-quality news are not more likely to rate a false/misleading article as true than those in the control group (n = 1,008, P = 0.420) (we confirmed this null result using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.182) in favour of the null hypothesis). This again suggests that exposure to unreliable news may explain why SOTEN increases belief in misinformation. Moreover, we found that respondents who are exposed to the top half of information quality in our sample information (top 50%) are no more likely to believe misinformation than those in the control group (n = 1,113, P = 0.429) (we confirmed this null finding using a Bayesian independent samples t-test (interquartile range = 0.707, BF10 = 0.103) in favour of the null hypothesis). To be clear, the information returned by the Google search results is post-treatment, so this analysis does not infer a causal relationship32, but it provides evidence consistent with the theory that low-quality information returned by search engines could explain the search effect that we identify. Note that we did not find a statistically significant differential effect of low-quality information on belief across different levels of ideological congruence to the news article (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nIf our proposed explanation is indeed correct and exposure to low-quality search results is associated with belief in misinformation, it remains unclear why certain individuals are exposed to low-quality news sources whereas others are not. In the next section, we investigate the search terms that individuals use to see whether this is associated with exposure to low-quality results. Specifically, we consider whether evidence from our study is consistent with two plausible interpretations for why individuals use search terms that are more likely to return low-quality information: ideological congruence with the perspective of the misinformation and digital literacy.\n\nIn all six studies, we received informed consent from all of the participants. We also excluded participants for inattentiveness. The researchers were not blinded to the hypotheses when carrying out the analyses. All experiments were randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\n\nThe preregistration for studies 1 and 2 is available online (https://osf.io/akemx/). The methods that we use for all six studies are based on the analysis outlined by this preregistration. It specified that all analyses would be performed at the level of the individual item (that is, one data point per item per participant) using linear regression with standard errors clustered on the participant. The linear regression was preregistered to have a belief in misinformation dummy variable (1 = false/misleading article rated as ‘true’; 0 = article rated as ‘false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’) as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: treatment dummy (1 = treatment group; 0 = control group), education (1 = no high school degree; 2 = high school degree; 3 = associates degree; 4 = bachelors degree; 5 = masters degree; 6 = doctorate degree), age, income (0 = US$0–50,000; 1 = US$50,000–100,000; 2 = US$100,000–150,000; 3 = US$150,000+), gender (1 = self-identify as female; 0 = self-identify as not female) and ideology (−3 = extremely liberal; −2 = liberal; −1 = slightly liberal; 0 = moderate; 1 = slightly conservative; 2 = conservative; 3 = extremely conservative). A full description of our variables used in studies 1–4 and study 5 is provided in Supplementary Information I and J. We also stated that we would repeat the main analysis using seven-point ordinal form (1,: definitely false to 7, definitely true) in addition to our categorical dummy variable. Our key prediction stated that the treatment—encouraging individuals to search online—would increase belief in misinformation, which is the hypothesis tested in this study.\n\nHowever, such an analysis does not account for the likely heterogenous treatment effect across articles evaluated or whether the respondent was ideologically congruent to the perspective of the article. Given this, we deviated from our preregistered plan on two distinct points: (1) to control for the likely heterogeneity in our treatment effect across articles, we add article fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the article level45 in addition to at the individual level; and (2) we replace the ideology variable with a dummy variable that accounts for whether an individual’s ideological perspective is congruent with the article’s perspective. Given that the congruence of one’s ideological perspective with that of the article, and not ideology per se, likely affects belief in misinformation, we think that this is the proper variable to use. Although we deviate from these aspects of the preregistered analysis, the results for studies 1–4 using this preregistered model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The results from these models support the hypothesis even more strongly than the results that we present in the main text of this paper.\n\nArticle-selection process\n\nTo distribute a representative sample of highly popular news articles directly after publication to respondents, we created a transparent, replicable and preregistered article-selection process that sourced highly popular false/misleading and true articles from across the ideological spectrum to be evaluated by respondents within 24–48 h of their publication. In study 4 (in which we sent only articles about COVID-19 to respondents), we delayed sending the articles to respondents for an additional 24 h to enable us to receive the assessment from our professional fact-checkers before sending the articles out to respondents. Doing so enabled us to communicate fact-checker assessments to respondents once they had completed their own assessment, therefore reducing the chance of causing medical harm by misinforming a survey participant about the pandemic.\n\nWe sourced one article per day from each of the following five news streams: liberal mainstream news domains; conservative mainstream news domains; liberal low-quality news domains; conservative low-quality news domains; and low-quality news domains with no clear political orientation. Each day, we chose the most popular online articles from these five streams that had appeared in the previous 24 h and sent them to respondents who were recruited either through Qualtrics (studies 1–4) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (study 5). An explanation of our sampling technique on Qualtrics and Mechanical Turk, why we chose the services and why we believe that these results can be generalized is provided in Supplementary Information D. Collecting and distributing the most popular false articles directly after publication is a key innovation that enabled us to measure the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation during the period in which people are most likely to consume it. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication.\n\nTo generate our streams of mainstream news, we collected the top 100 news sites by US consumption identified by Microsoft Research’s Project Ratio between 2016 and 2019. To classify these websites as liberal or conservative, we used scores of media partisanship from a previous study46, which assigns ideological estimates to websites on the basis of the URL-sharing behaviour of social media users: websites with a score of below zero were classified as liberal and those above zero were classified as conservative. The top ten websites in each group (liberal or conservative) by consumption were then chosen to create a liberal mainstream and conservative mainstream news feed. For our low-quality news sources, we relied on the list of low-quality news sources from a previous study3 that were still active at the start of our study in November 2019. We subsequently classified all low-quality sources into three streams: liberal leaning sources, conservative leaning sources and those with no clear partisan orientation. The list of the sources in all five streams, as well as an explanation for how the ideology for low-quality sources was determined, is provided in Supplementary Information E (Supplementary Tables 67–71).\n\nOn each day of studies 1, 2 and 5, we selected the most popular article from the past 24 h. We used CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform that tracks the popularity of URLs on Facebook pages, for the mainstream sources, and RSS feeds, for the low-quality sources, from each of the five streams. We used RSS feeds for the low-quality sources instead of CrowdTangle because the Facebook pages of most low-quality sources had been banned and were therefore not tracked by CrowdTangle. Articles chosen by this algorithm therefore represent the most popular credible and low-quality news from across the ideological spectrum. The number of public Twitter (recently renamed X) posts and public Facebook group posts that contained each article in studies 1, 2 and 3 is provided in Supplementary Tables 72 and 73 in Supplementary Information G. In study 3, we used the same articles used in study 2, but distributed them to respondents 3 to 5 months after publication. In study 4, to test whether this search effect is robust to news stories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sampled only the most popular articles of which the central claim covered the health, economic, political or social effects of COVID-19. During study 4 and 5, we also added a list of low-quality news sources known to publish pandemic-related misinformation, which was compiled by NewsGuard.\n\nIt is important to note that we are testing the search effect during the time period in which our studies run (from study 1 in late 2019 to study 5 in late 2021). It is possible that, over time, the online information environment may change as the result of new search strategies and/or search algorithms.\n\nSurveys\n\nIn each study, we sent out an online survey that asked respondents a battery of questions related to the daily articles that had been selected by our article-selection protocol, as well as a litany of demographic questions. While they completed the survey within the Qualtrics platform, they viewed the articles directly on the website where they had been originally published. Respondents evaluated each article using a variety of criteria, the most germane of which was a categorical evaluation question: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” to which respondents could choose from three responses: (1) true; (2) misleading/false; and (3) could not determine. The respondents were also asked to assess the accuracy of the news article on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (definitely not true) to 7 (definitely true). In study 5, we also asked the respondents to evaluate articles based on a four-point ordinal scale: “to the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the central claim in the article?” (1) Not at all accurate; (2) not very accurate; (3) somewhat accurate; and (4) Very accurate.\n\nWe ran our analyses using both categorical responses and the ordinal scale(s). To assess the reliability and validity of both measures, we predict the rating of an article on a seven-point scale using a dummy variable measuring whether that respondent rated that article as true on the categorical measure using a simple linear regression. We found that, across each study, rating an article as true on average increases the veracity scale rating on average by 2.75 points on the seven-point scale (approximately 1.5 s.d. of the ratings on the ordinal scale). The full results are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. To ensure that responses that we use were actually from respondents who evaluated articles in good faith, two relatively simple attention checks for each article, which do not depend on any ability associated with the evaluation task, were used. If a respondent failed any of these attention checks, all of their evaluations were omitted from this analysis. These attention check questions can be found in Supplementary Information F.\n\nDetermining the veracity of articles\n\nOne of the key challenges in this study was determining the veracity of the article in the period directly after publication. Whereas many studies use source quality as a proxy for article quality, not all articles from suspect news sites are actually false3. Other studies have relied on professional fact-checking organizations such as Snopes or Politifact to identify false/misleading stories from these sources47,48. However, the use of evaluations from these organization is impossible when sourcing articles in real time because we have no way of knowing whether these articles will ever be checked by such organizations. As an alternative evaluation mechanism, we hired six professional fact checkers from leading national media organizations to also assess each article during the same 24 h period as respondents. In studies 4 and 5, given the onset of the pandemic and the potential harm caused by medical misinformation, the professional fact-checkers rated the articles 24 h before the respondents so that we could show respondents the fact-checkers’ ratings of each article immediately after completion of the survey. These professional fact-checkers were recruited from a diverse group of reputable publications (none of the fact-checkers were employed by a publication included in our studies to ensure no conflicts of interest) and were paid US$10.00 per article. The modal response of the professional fact checkers yielded 37 false/misleading, 102 true and 16 indeterminate articles from study 1. Most articles were evaluated by five fact-checkers; a few were evaluated by four or six. A different group of six fact-checkers evaluated all of the articles during studies 4 and 5 relative to studies 1–3. We use the modal response of the professional fact checkers to determine whether we code an article as ‘true’, ’false/misleading’ or ‘could not determine’. We are then able to assess the ability of our respondents to identify the veracity of an article by comparing their response to the modal professional fact checker response. In terms of inter-rater reliability among fact-checkers, we report a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.42 for all fact-checker evaluations of articles used in this paper. We also report the article-level agreement between each pair of fact-checkers and average weighted Cohen kappa score between each pair of fact-checkers in Supplementary Table 74 in Supplementary Information K. These scores are reported for the articles that were rated by five professional fact-checkers. Although this level of agreement is quite low, it is slightly higher than other studies that have used professional fact-checkers to rate the veracity of both credible and suspect articles using similar scale our fact-checkers used49. This low level of agreement of professionals over what is misinformation may also explain why so many respondents believe misinformation and why searching online does not effectively reduce this problem. Identifying misinformation is a difficult task, even for professionals.\n\nWe also present all of the analyses in this paper using only false/misleading articles with a robust mode—which we define as any modal response of fact-checkers that would not change if one professional fact-checker changed their response—to remove articles where there was higher levels of disagreement among professional fact-checkers. These results can be found in Supplementary Table 74 Supplementary Information K. We found that the direction of our results does not change when using the false/misleading articles with a robust mode, although the effect is no longer statistically significant for 2 out of the 4 studies using the categorical measure and 1 out of the 4 studies using the continuous measure. To determine whether the search effect changes with the rate of agreement of fact-checkers, we ran an interaction model and present the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. We found that the search effect does appear to weaken for articles that fact-checkers most agree are false/misleading. Put another way, the search effect is strongest for articles in which there is less fact-checker agreement that the article is false, suggesting that online search may be especially ineffective when the veracity of articles is most difficult to ascertain. Although this is the case, the search effect for only false/misleading articles with a robust mode (one fact-checker changing their decision from false/misleading to true will not change the modal fact-checker evaluation) is still quite consistent and strong. These results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 2–5 in Supplementary Information M.\n\nStudy 1\n\nIn study 1, we tested whether SOTEN affects belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran for 10 days. During this study, we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window, but asked only one of the groups to do this after searching online. We preregistered a hypothesis that both false/misleading and true news were more likely to be rated as true by those who were encouraged to search online. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nOn ten separate days (21 November 2019 to 7 January 2020), we randomly assigned a group of respondents to be encouraged to search online before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity. Over these 10 days, 13 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not requested to search online (resulting in 1,145 evaluations from 876 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were requested to search online (resulting in 1,130 evaluations from 872 unique respondents). The articles used during this study can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–5 in Supplementary Information A.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. We then presented the participants with three out of five articles selected that day randomly (no articles could be shown to a respondent more than once). For each article, the respondents in each group were asked a series questions about the article, such as whether it is an opinion article, their interest in the article, and their perceived reliability of the source. Those in the control group were presented with the veracity questions most relevant to this study: “What is your assessment of the central claim in the article?” with the following options: (1) true: the central claim you are evaluating is factually accurate. (2) Misleading and/or false: misleading: the central claim takes out of context, misrepresents or omits evidence. False: the central claim is factually inaccurate. (3) Could not determine: you do not feel you can judge whether the central claim is true, false or misleading. The participants were also asked a seven-point ordinal scale veracity question: “now that you have evaluated the article, we are interested in the strength of your opinion. Please rank the article on the following scale: 1 (definitely not true), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (definitely true)”. Differing from the control group, the participants in the treatment group (encouraged to search for additional information) were given instructions before these two veracity questions (see below). These instructions encouraged them to search online and asked the respondents questions about their search online.\n\nInstructions to find evidence to evaluate central claim\n\nThe following instructions were provided to respondents in studies 1–5 before SOTEN.\n\n“The purpose of this section is to find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating. This evidence should allow you to assess whether the central claim is true, false or somewhere in between. Guidance for the finding evidence for or against the central claim you’ve identified:\n\n(1)\n\nBy evidence, we mean an article, statement, photo, video, audio or statistic relevant to the central claim. This evidence should be reported by some other source than the author of the article you are investigating. This evidence can either support the initial claim or go against it.\n\n(2)\n\nTo find evidence about the claim, you should use a keyword search on a search engine of your choice or within the website of a particular source you trust as an authority on the topic related to the claim you’re evaluating.\n\n(3)\n\nWe ask that you use the highest-quality pieces of evidence to evaluate the central claim in your search. If you cannot find evidence about the claim from a source that you trust, you should try to find the most relevant evidence about the claim you can find from any source, even one you don’t trust.\n\nFor additional instructions explaining how to find evidence please click this text” (these additional instructions are provided in Supplementary Information H, and the instructions that we gave respondents for the extra study omitting some instructions are provided in Supplementary Information O).\n\nWe next presented respondents with the following four questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat are the keywords you used to research this original claim? If you searched multiple times, enter just the keywords you used on your final/successful search. If you used a reverse image search, please enter “reverse image search” in the text box.\n\n(2)\n\nWhich of the following best describes the highest quality evidence you found about the claim in your search? Possible responses: (A) I found evidence from a source that I trust. (B) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t know enough about to trust or distrust. (C) I found evidence, but it’s from a source that I don’t trust. (D) I did not find evidence about this claim.\n\n(3)\n\nEvidence link: please paste the link for the highest quality evidence you found (paste only the text of the URL link here. Do not include additional text from the webpage/article, etc.). If you did not find any evidence, please type the following phrase in the text box below: “No Evidence”.\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional evidence links: if you use other different evidence sources that are particularly helpful, please paste the additional sources here.\n\nAfter the participants read the instructions and were asked these questions about their online search, those in the treatment group were presented with the two veracity questions of interest (categorical and seven-point ordinal scale). In both the control and treatment conditions, the response options were listed in the same order as they are listed in this section.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was preregistered (https://osf.io/akemx/).\n\nBalance table\n\nSupplementary Table 95 in Supplementary Information Q compares basic demographic variables among respondents in the control and treatment group. This table shows that respondents were similar across demographic variables, except for income. Those in the control group self-reported making higher levels of income than those in the treatment group. We did not record the data for 83.2% of those who entered the survey and were in the control group and 85.8% of those in the treatment group. The majority of respondents dropped out of the survey at the beginning. About 66% of all respondents who entered the survey refused to consent or did not move past the first two consent questions. Taken together, of all of the respondents who moved past the consent questions, 51% of respondents dropped out of the survey in the control group and 58% of the respondents dropped out of the survey in the treatment group. About 11% of those who did not complete the survey did so because they failed the attention checks and were removed from the survey.\n\nStudy 2\n\nStudy 2 ran similarly to study 1, but over 29 days between 18 November 2019 and 6 February 2020. In each survey that was sent in study 1, we asked respondents in the control group to evaluate the third article they received a second time, but only after looking for evidence online (using the same directions to search online that participants in study 1 received).\n\nThis study measures the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation but, instead of running a between-respondent random control trial, we run a within-respondent study. In this study, the participants first evaluated articles without being encouraged to search online. After providing their veracity evaluation on both the categorical and ordinal scales, they were encouraged to search online to help them re-evaluate the article’s veracity using the same instructions as from study 1. This is probably a more difficult test of the effect of searching online, as individuals have already anchored themselves to their previous response. Literature on confirmation bias leads us to believe that new information will have the largest effect when individuals have not already evaluated the news article on its own. Thus study therefore enables us to measure whether the effect of searching online is strong enough to change an individual’s evaluation of a news article after they have evaluated the article on its own. We did not preregister a hypothesis, but we did pose this as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nDuring study 2, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,054 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 96 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nSimilar to study 1, respondents initially evaluated articles as if they were in the control group, but after they finished their evaluation they were then presented with this text: “Now that you have evaluated the article, we would like you evaluate the article again, but this time find evidence from another source regarding the central claim that you’re evaluating”. They were then prompted with the same instructions and questions as the treatment group in study 1.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nThis analysis was posed as an exploratory research question in the registered report for study 1.\n\nStudy 3\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 3, this study replicated study 2 using the same materials and procedure, but was run between 16 March 2020 and 28 April 2020, 3–5 months after the publication of each these articles. This study set out to test whether this search effect remained largely the same months after the publication of misinformation when professional fact-checks and other credible reporting on the topic are hopefully more prevalent. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nIn total, 33 unique false or misleading articles were evaluated and re-evaluated by 1,011 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–12 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 97 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 4\n\nAlthough no pre-analysis plan was filed for study 4, this study extended study 2 by asking individuals to evaluate and re-evaluate highly popular misinformation strictly about COVID-19 after searching online. This study was run over 8 days between 28 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. In the ‘Article-selection process’ section, we describe the changes that we made in our article-selection process to collect these articles. We collected these articles and sent them out to be evaluated by respondents. This study measured whether the effect of searching online on belief in misinformation still holds for misinformation about a salient event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511). This IRB submission is the same as the one used for studies 1, 2 and 3, but it was modified and approved in May 2020 before we sent out articles related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nA total of 13 false or misleading unique articles was evaluated and re-evaluated by 386 respondents. We then compared their evaluation before being requested to search online (the treatment) and their evaluation after searching online. The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 13–17 in Supplementary Information A. Summary statistics for all of the respondents in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 98 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nStudy 5\n\nTo test the effect of exposure to unreliable news on belief in misinformation, we ran a fifth and final study that combined survey and digital trace data. This study was almost identical to study 1, but we used a custom plug-in to collect digital trace data and encouraged the respondents to specifically search online using Google (our web browser plug-in could collect search results only from a Google search result page). Similar to study 1, we measured the effect of SOTEN on belief in misinformation in a randomized controlled trial that ran on 12 separate days from 13 July 2021 to 9 November 2021, during which we asked two different groups of respondents to evaluate the same false/misleading or true articles in the same 24 h window. The treatment group was encouraged to search online, while the control group was not. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2021-5608).\n\nParticipants and materials\n\nUnlike the other four studies, these respondents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Only workers within the United States (verified by IP address) and those with above a 95% success rate were allowed to participate. We were unable to recruit a representative sample of Americans using sampling quotas owing to the difficulty of recruiting respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were willing to install a web-tracking browser extension in the 24 h period after our algorithm selected articles to be evaluated.\n\nOver 12 days during study 5, a group of respondents were encouraged to SOTEN before providing their assessment of the article’s veracity (treatment) and another group was not encouraged to search online when they evaluated these articles (control). A total of 17 different false/misleading articles were evaluated by individuals in our control group who were not encouraged to search online (877 evaluations from 621 unique respondents) and those in our treatment group who were encouraged to search online (608 evaluations from 451 unique respondents). The articles used during this experiment are provided in Supplementary Tables 18–22 in Supplementary Information A. We do not find statistically significant evidence that respondents who we were recruited to the control group were different on a number of demographic variables. Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q compares those in the treatment and control group. Only 20% of those in the control group who consented to participate in the survey dropped out of the study, whereas 62% of those who entered the survey and were in the treatment group dropped out of the study. This difference in compliance rates can be explained by the difference in the web extension for the treatment group relative to the one given to the control group. For technical reasons related to capturing HTML, the respondents in the treatment group had to wait at least 5 s for the web extension that was installed to collect their Google search engine results, which may have resulted in some respondents accidentally removing the web extension. If they did not wait for 5 s on a Google search results page, the extension would turn off and they would have to turn it back on. These instructions were presented clearly to the respondents, but probably resulted in differences in compliance. This differential attrition does not result in any substantively meaningful differences between those who completed the survey in the treatment and control group as shown in Supplementary Table 99 in Supplementary Information Q.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe participants in both the control and treatment group were given the following instructions at the beginning of the survey: “In this survey you will be asked to evaluate the central claim of three recent news articles”. Those assigned to the treatment group were then asked to install a web extension that would collect their digital trace data including their Google search history. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. To evaluate these news articles we will ask you to search online using Google about each news article online and then use Google Search results to help you evaluate the news articles. We need you to install the web extension and then search on Google for relevant information pertaining to each article in order for us to compensate you”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate the “Search Engine Results Saver”, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-engine-results-sav/mjdfiochiimhfgbdgkielodbojlpfcbl?hl=en&authuser=2). Those assigned to the control group were also asked to install a web extension that collected their digital trace data, but not any search engine results. They were presented with the following text: “In this section we will ask you to install our plugin and then evaluate three news articles. You must install the extension, log in and keep this extension on for the whole survey to be fully compensated”. They were then presented with instructions to download and activate URL Historian, which is available at the Google Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-historian/imdfbahhoamgbblienjdoeafphlngdim). Both those in the control and treatment group were asked to download and install a web extension that tracked their web behaviour to limit varying levels of attrition across both groups, due to the unwillingness or inability of respondents to install this kind of extension. After the respondents downloaded their respective web extension, the study ran identical to study 1.\n\nDigital trace data\n\nBy asking individuals to download and activate web browsers that collected their URL history and scraped their search engine results, we were able to measure the quality of news they were exposed to when they searched online. We were unable to collect this data if respondents did not search on Google, deactivated their web browser while they were taking the survey, or did not wait on a search engine result page for at least 5 s. Thus, in total for the 653 evaluations of misinformation in our treatment group, we collected Google search results for 508 evaluations (78% of all evaluations). We also collected the URL history of those in the control group, but did not use these data in our analyses. For most demographic characteristics (age, gender, income and education), we have statistically significant evidence that respondents from whom we were able to collect search engine results were slightly different compared with those from whom we were not able to collect these results. We find that participants from whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.8 on a seven-point scale, more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy and less likely to self-identify as female. Supplementary Table 100 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the treatment group. Those compliant in the treatment group were slightly younger by two and a half years and slightly more likely to be male.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nNo preregistration was filed for this study.\n\nWhen we analysed the effect of the quality of online information, we included only those in the control group who kept their web extension on during the survey to limit possible selection bias effects. In the control group, 93% of the respondents evaluated a false/misleading article in the control group installed the web extension that tracked their own digital trace data throughout the whole survey. Similar to the treatment group, we do find that those for whom we were able to collect this digital trace data were more likely to self-identify as liberal by about 0.55 on a seven-point scale and more likely to self-report higher levels of digital literacy. The magnitude of these differences are modest and the direction of these differences are identical to the differences in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 101 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying and non-complying individuals within the control group. We do not see large differences in how those who are compliant in the control group differ from those who are compliant in the treatment group. Supplementary Table 102 in Supplementary Information Q compares complying individuals in the treatment and control groups.\n\nTo measure the quality of search results, we use scores from Newsguard, an internet plug-in that informs users whether a site that they are viewing is reliable. NewsGuard employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and rate news and information websites based on nine criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of journalistic credibility and transparency, assigning a score from 0 to 100. Sites with a score below 60 are deemed to be unreliable, and those with a score of above 60 are deemed to be reliable. NewsGuard has ratings for over 5,000 online news domains, responsible for about 95% of all the news consumed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. More information is available online (https://www.newsguardtech.com). A sample of their ratings can be found online (https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/sample-nutrition-labels/). The full list of online news domains and their ratings is licensed by NewsGuard to approved researchers.\n\nStudy 6\n\nStudy 6 tests whether the search effects that we identify on belief in false/misleading and true articles still hold when we change the instructions we present to respondents. To this end, we ran an experiment similar to study 1, but we added two other treatment arms in which we encouraged individuals to search online to evaluate news. This study was approved by the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (IRB-FY2019-3511).\n\nEthics\n\nWe complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All of the studies were reviewed and approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 were approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-351. Study 5 was approved by NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2021-5608. Study 6 was approved by a modified NYU IRB protocol IRB-FY2019-3511. All of the experimental participants provided informed consent before taking part. The participants were given the option to withdraw from the study while the experiment was ongoing as well as to withdraw their data at any time.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-search-engines-boost-misinformation/', 'Headline': 'How Search Engines Boost Misinformation | Scientific American', 'Snippet': 'For example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.”', 'Full_text': ""“Do your own research” is a popular tagline among fringe groups and ideological extremists. Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research.\n\nYet more mainstream groups have also offered this advice. Digital literacy advocates and those seeking to combat online misinformation sometimes spread the idea that when you are faced with a piece of news that seems odd or out of sync with reality, the best course of action is to investigate it yourself. For instance, in 2021 the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General put out a guide recommending that those wondering about a health claim’s legitimacy should “type the claim into a search engine to see if it has been verified by a credible source.” Library and research guides, often suggestthat people “Google it!” or use other search engines to vet information.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nUnfortunately, this time science seems to be on the conspiracy theorists’ side. Encouraging Internet users to rely on search engines to verify questionable online articles can make them more prone to believing false or misleading information, according to a study published today in Nature. The new research quantitatively demonstrates how search results, especially those prompted by queries that contain keywords from misleading articles, can easily lead people down digital rabbit holes and backfire. Guidance to Google a topic is insufficient if people aren’t considering what they search for and the factors that determine the results, the study suggests.\n\nIn five different experiments conducted between late 2019 and 2022, the researchers asked a total of thousands of online participants to categorize timely news articles as true, false or unclear. A subset of the participants received prompting to use a search engine before categorizing the articles, whereas a control group didn’t. At the same time, six professional fact-checkers evaluated the articles to provide definitive designations. Across the different tests, the nonprofessional respondents were about 20 percent more likely to rate false or misleading information as true after they were encouraged to search online. This pattern held even for very salient, heavily reported news topics such as the COVID pandemic and even after months had elapsed between an article’s initial publication and the time of the participants’ search (when presumably more fact-checks would be available online).\n\nFor one experiment, the study authors also tracked participants’ search terms and the links provided on the first page of the results of a Google query. They found that more than a third of respondents were exposed to misinformation when they searched for more detail on misleading or false articles. And often respondents’ search terms contributed to those troubling results: Participants used the headline or URL of a misleading article in about one in 10 verification attempts. In those cases, misinformation beyond the original article showed up in results more than half the time.\n\nFor example, one of the misleading articles used in the study was entitled “U.S. faces engineered famine as COVID lockdowns and vax mandates could lead to widespread hunger, unrest this winter.” When participants included “engineered famine”—a unique term specifically used by low-quality news sources—in their fact-check searches, 63 percent of these queries prompted unreliable results. In comparison, none of the search queries that excluded the word “engineered” returned misinformation.\n\n“I was surprised by how many people were using this kind of naive search strategy,” says the study’s lead author Kevin Aslett, an assistant professor of computational social science at the University of Central Florida. “It’s really concerning to me.”\n\nSearch engines are often people’s first and most frequent pit stops on the Internet, says study co-author Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. And it’s anecdotally well-established they play a role in manipulating public opinion and disseminating shoddy information, as exemplified by social scientist Safiya Noble’s research into how search algorithms have historically reinforced racist ideas. But while a bevy of scientific research has assessed the spread of misinformation across social media platforms, fewer quantitative assessments have focused on search engines.\n\nThe new study is novel for measuring just how much a search can shift users’ beliefs, says Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. “I’m really glad to see someone quantitatively show what my recent qualitative research has suggested,” says Zimdars, who co-edited the book Fake News: Understanding Media and Misinformation in the Digital Age. She adds that she’s conducted research interviews with many people who have noted that they frequently use search engines to vet information they see online and that doing so has made fringe ideas seem “more legitimate.”\n\n“This study provides a lot of empirical evidence for what many of us have been theorizing,” says Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist and media scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People often assume top results have been vetted, she says. And while tech companies such as Google have instituted efforts to rein in misinformation, things often still fall through the cracks. Problems especially arise in “data voids” when information is sparse for particular topics. Often those seeking to spread a particular message will purposefully take advantage of these data voids, coining terms likely to circumvent mainstream media sources and then repeating them across platforms until they become conspiracy buzzwords that lead to more misinformation, Tripodi says.\n\nGoogle actively tries to combat this problem, a company spokesperson tells Scientific American. “At Google, we design our ranking systems to emphasize quality and not to expose people to harmful or misleading information that they are not looking for,” the Google representative says. “We also provide people tools that help them evaluate the credibility of sources.” For example, the company adds warnings on some search results when a breaking news topic is rapidly evolving and might not yet yield reliable results. The spokesperson further notes that several assessments have determined Google outcompetes other search engines when it comes to filtering out misinformation. Yet data voids pose an ongoing challenge to all search providers, they add.\n\nThat said, the new research has its own limitations. For one, the experimental setup means the study doesn’t capture people’s natural behavior when it comes to evaluating news says Danaë Metaxa, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, they point out, didn’t give all participants the option of deciding whether to search, and people might have behaved differently if they were given a choice. Further, even the professional fact-checkers that contributed to the study were confused by some of the articles, says Joel Breakstone, director of Stanford University’s History Education Group, where he researches and develops digital literacy curriculums focused on combatting online misinformation. The fact-checkers didn’t always agree on how to categorize articles. And among stories for which more fact-checkers disagreed, searches also showed a stronger tendency to boost participants’ belief in misinformation. It’s possible that some of the study findings are simply the result of confusing information—not search results.\n\nYet the work still highlights a need for better digital literacy interventions, Breakstone says. Instead of just telling people to search, guidance on navigating online information should be much clearer about how to search and what to search for. Breakstone’s research has found that techniques such as lateral reading, where a person is encouraged to seek out information about a source, can reduce belief in misinformation. Avoiding the trap of terminology and diversifying search terms is an important strategy, too, Tripodi adds.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a multipronged solution to misinformation—one that is much more contextual and spans politics, culture, people and technology,” Zimdars says. People are often drawn to misinformation because of their own lived experiences that foster suspicion in systems, such as negative interactions with health care providers, she adds. Beyond strategies for individual data literacy, tech companies and their online platforms, as well as government leaders, need to take steps to address the root causes of public mistrust and to lessen the flow of faux news. There is no single fix or perfect Google strategy poised to shut down misinformation. Instead the search continues.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/08/correcting-misinformation-about-dr-fauci/', 'Headline': 'Correcting Misinformation About Dr. Fauci - FactCheck.org', 'Snippet': 'Posted on August 25, 2022.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/politics/hillary-clinton-john-durham/index.html', 'Headline': 'Durham interviewed Hillary Clinton on alleged plan to tie Trump to ...', 'Snippet': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes ...', 'Full_text': 'Special counsel John Durham’s report released Monday details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia but which Durham concludes “did not, all things considered, amount to a provable criminal offense.”\n\nDurham reveals in a footnote that he interviewed the former secretary of State in May 2022 as part of his investigation.\n\nThe special counsel was looking into whether any crimes occurred in the handling of an uncorroborated piece of US intelligence indicating Russia knew of a Clinton campaign plan to vilify her opponent, Trump, by tying him to the country.\n\nThe 2016 intelligence got the attention of then-CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed the Obama White House and referred the issue to the FBI.

Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States and current president-elect. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels as hush money to buy her silence over a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a]\n\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA\'s office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump\'s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\n\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for November 26. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling.\n\nBackground\n\nStormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah\'s Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7]\n\nIn 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels\' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump\'s lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story\'s veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story\'s removal.[9]\n\nAs Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels\' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8]\n\nUltimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump\'s claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14]\n\nTrump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump\'s status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump\'s first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17]\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen\'s payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21]\n\nOn May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22]\n\nManhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nFollowing Cohen\'s August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25][b]\n\nThe Manhattan DA\'s office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump\'s corporate tax returns.[28] Trump\'s lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump\'s immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30]\n\nFollowing the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA\'s office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump\'s role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA\'s office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA\'s office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA\'s prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels\' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA\'s office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen\'s reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52]\n\nIn March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels\' allegation and the DA\'s proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump\'s lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City\'s Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump\'s lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59]\n\nIn late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60]\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg\'s allegedly false charge.[76][g]\n\nTrump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86]\n\nEligibility for president\n\nThe Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88]\n\nInitial proceedings\n\nIndictment and charges\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92]\n\nThe indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95]\n\n11 for invoices from Michael Cohen\n\n9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump\n\n9 for checks from Donald J. Trump\n\n3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\n2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust\n\nThe allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump\'s payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97]\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95]\n\nA New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge.\n\nIn later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101]\n\nEach count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] He is permitted to assume the presidency even should he be in prison.[105] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[106]\n\nThe conviction did not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, which he won.[105] (Trump had stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would continue his candidacy even if convicted.)[107][108]\n\nArraignment\n\nTrump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump\'s expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump\'s case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom\'s glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118]\n\nUpon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130]\n\nPossible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump\'s defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131]\n\nImmediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133]\n\nPre-trial proceedings\n\nDuring Trump\'s arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131]\n\nAs he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135]\n\nTrump\'s lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h]\n\nRequest for indictment dismissal\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Trump\'s team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140]\n\nOn April 27, Trump\'s team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA\'s office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump\'s team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump\'s request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149]\n\nDiscovery materials and witnesses\n\nAs of Trump\'s arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150]\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the DA\'s office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm\'s correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151]\n\nOn May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office\'s request to restrict information it turns over to Trump\'s lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155]\n\nOn May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump\'s lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159]\n\nOn August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll\'s civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll\'s lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162]\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump\'s counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165]\n\nOn March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump\'s Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166]\n\nOn April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170]\n\nOn May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution\'s plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg\'s testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173]\n\nRequests for recusal\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump\'s case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175]\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the case citing his daughter\'s position as partner and COO of Authentic Campaigns, a consulting firm that serviced Biden\'s 2020 presidential campaign. The motion additionally alleged that Merchan had encouraged former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to cooperate with the prosecution against Trump in a previous case he had presided over, and that Merchan had made three $10–15 donations to various Democratic causes.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA\'s office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump\'s alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter\'s Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter\'s Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan\'s handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge\'s impartiality.[188][n]\n\nThe same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge\'s daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator\'s statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan\'s expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan\'s daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump\'s campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan\'s daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p]\n\nOn April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206]\n\nRequest for removal to federal court\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Trump\'s lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump\'s inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211]\n\nIn a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump\'s conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215]\n\nTrial scheduling\n\nOn May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump\'s team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219]\n\nIn early February 2024, Trump\'s federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221]\n\nOn March 11, 2024, Trump\'s lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump\'s team cited, from April 2018, Trump\'s denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen\'s credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump\'s team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224]\n\nAlso on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court\'s term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228]\n\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen\'s payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump\'s lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump\'s lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA\'s office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump\'s defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump\'s team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump\'s request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234]\n\nOn March 18, Trump\'s team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA\'s case specifically. Trump\'s lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn\'t keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump\'s team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202]\n\nOn April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump\'s request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant\'s request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron\'s high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son\'s graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243]\n\nGag order\n\nIn a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245]\n\nAt Trump\'s arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don\'t share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247]\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge\'s law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan\'s daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258]\n\nOn March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan\'s daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg\'s family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump\'s continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264]\n\nContempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump\'s request to overturn the order.[265]\n\nAlso on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, JD Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan\'s daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen\'s May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they\'re speaking very beautifully.""[272]\n\nOn May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273]\n\nOn June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump\'s gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following sentencing.[275]\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nIn New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276]\n\nMerchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump\'s first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276]\n\nThe New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor\'s Executive Order was sufficient.[277]\n\nOverview of witnesses\n\nProsecution witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Witness Date Function David Pecker April 22 Publisher of National Enquirer April 23 April 25 April 26 Rhona Graff April 26 Donald Trump executive assistant April 30 Gary Farro April 30 First Republic banker Robert Browning April 30 C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Phillip Thompson April 30 Regional Director of Esquire Deposition Solutions Keith Davidson April 30 Former attorney for Stormy Daniels May 2 Douglas Daus May 2 Computer forensics specialist in the Manhattan DA\'s office Hope Hicks May 3 Former White House Communications Director Jeffrey McConney May 6 Former Trump Organization comptroller Deborah Tarasoff May 6 Trump Organization accounting employee Sally Franklin May 7 Penguin Books executive Stormy Daniels May 7 Hush money recipient May 9 Rebecca Manochio May 9 Trump Organization bookkeeper Tracey Menzies May 9 Senior vice president at HarperCollins Madeleine Westerhout May 9 Former Director of Oval Office Operations May 10 Jennie Tomalin May 10 Verizon senior analyst Daniel Dixon May 10 AT&T compliance analyst Jaden Jarmel-Schneider May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Georgia Longstreet May 10 Paralegal in the Manhattan DA\'s office Michael Cohen May 13 Hush money intermediary May 14 May 16 May 20\n\nDefense witnesses in the prosecution of Donald Trump in New York Date Witness Function Daniel Sitko May 20 Paralegal for defense attorney Robert Costello May 20 Associate of Michael Cohen May 21\n\nTrial\n\nThe trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281]\n\nThe trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r]\n\nThe temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump\'s complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293]\n\nJury selection and opening statements\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297]\n\nOver the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s]\n\nHowever, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306]\n\nAnother group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311]\n\nTrump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u]\n\nOn April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331]\n\nThe defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329]\n\nContempt hearings\n\nOn April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307]\n\nOn April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump\'s attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump\'s claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump\'s claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You\'re losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump\'s position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336]\n\nOn April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343]\n\nOn May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352]\n\nThe mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353]\n\nProsecution witnesses\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nProsecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial\'s first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker\'s testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer\'s parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels\' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump\'s enemies, which Pecker\'s staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump\'s 2016 campaign.[363]\n\nOn April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump\'s team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump\'s campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract\'s true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal\'s source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump\'s behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump\'s behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366]\n\nGraff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n\nFour witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30.\n\nOn April 26, Trump\'s executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump\'s office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371]\n\nAdditional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels\' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen\'s home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen\'s accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375]\n\nApril 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump\'s October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377]\n\nOn May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379]\n\nKeith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n\nSee also: Keith Davidson § Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson\'s testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385]\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels\' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson\'s role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal\'s story was noted as well.[375]\n\nOn May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal\'s story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can\'t even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen\'s claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157]\n\nOn May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney\'s office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen\'s cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390]\n\nHope Hicks\n\nSee also: Hope Hicks § Career\n\nOn May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal\'s allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels\' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks\'s opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395]\n\nAccording to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape\'s release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371]\n\nMcConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n\nThree witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7.\n\nOn May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump\'s personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs\'s offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump\'s personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401]\n\nFollowing McConney\'s testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don\'t know every aspect of what you\'re doing, down to the paper clips, you\'re setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I\'ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406]\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nStormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409]\n\nIn accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409]\n\nDuring Daniels\' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels\' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense\'s request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels\' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407]\n\nWhen testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409]\n\nIn its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump\'s hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409]\n\nOn May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418]\n\nManochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n\nOn May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421]\n\nTrump\'s director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424]\n\nWesterhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423]\n\nDixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n\nFor the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA\'s office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump\'s old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423]\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nOn May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case\'s star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427]\n\nOn May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump\'s sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer\'s first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump\'s behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426]\n\nCohen acknowledged Hicks\'s testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9]\n\nCohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels\' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There\'s no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump\'s golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump\'s 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump\'s 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump\'s presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401]\n\nCohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426]\n\nOn May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump\'s message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News\' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump\'s personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436]\n\nOn May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump\'s ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446]\n\nDefense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430]\n\nThe defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457]\n\nThe prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460]\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nThe defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan\'s past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac]\n\nThe defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith\'s testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge\'s role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of \'hush money payments\'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge\'s bias is very evident.""[481]\n\nDaniel Sitko\n\nOn May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483]\n\nRobert Costello\n\nOn May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485]\n\nOn May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump\'s campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these \'journalists\' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486]\n\nClosing arguments and jury instructions\n\nLater on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad]\n\nOn May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen\'s decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels\' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497]\n\nThe same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker\'s testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels\' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump\'s ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization\'s legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump\'s attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493]\n\nSteinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense\'s characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503]\n\nJury deliberations and verdict\n\nOn May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump\'s ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker\'s testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508]\n\nOn May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511]\n\nPost-trial proceedings\n\nGag order\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517]\n\nOn June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518]\n\nOn June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors\' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521]\n\nIn July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[522] The lawsuit sought to block Trump\'s gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians\' First Amendment rights.[522] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[523]\n\nDelayed sentencing hearing\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[524][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[525][529]\n\nBefore his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[530][531] Trump\'s rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[532] Trump\'s proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump\'s mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[533] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[534]\n\nTrump\'s sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[535] However, Trump\'s counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][536] The Manhattan DA\'s office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team\'s position lacked merit.[537] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[538] In August, Trump\'s team asked Merchan to again postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election,[539] and the Manhattan DA stated that it would defer to Merchan on this matter.[540] On September 6, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to November 26.[541][542]\n\nOn August 29, Trump\'s lawyers asked the federal court for the Southern District of New York to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[543] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request on the basis that the payments were an unofficial act.[544][545] Hours later, Trump\'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.[546] Although Merchan granted the sentencing delay, on October 14 Trump\'s counsel asked the Second Circuit to reconsider Hellerstein\'s rejection, arguing that it was based upon ""profoundly flawed analysis"" and continuing to assert that instead of being personally prosecuted, Trump was being politically persecuted.[545]\n\nOn November 12, the immunity hearing was delayed a week, to November 19, likely putting the sentencing date at risk as well.[547]\n\nImmunity ruling\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump\'s counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][536] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks\' and Westerhout\'s testimony.[548][549][550]\n\nTrump\'s motion was formally made on July 11.[550] Merchan\'s ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[548] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[550]\n\nJudge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352]\n\nMerchan\'s ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump\'s third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[551] The immunity ruling was expected by September 16.[552][553] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump\'s request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[554] On September 6, Merchan postponed the immunity ruling to November 12.[541] On that day, Merchan agreed to a request from prosecutors to pause the case for a week while they considered how Trump\'s election could impact proceedings.[555][556]\n\nFirearms and liquor licenses\n\nTrump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[557] Trump\'s New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[558] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[559] [560] As of June 5, 2024, Trump\'s New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD\'s legal bureau completes its investigation.[561] At Trump\'s pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[562][563]\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[564] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[564][565][566] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[564][567] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until after Trump\'s sentencing.[568][564]\n\nPotential appeal of conviction\n\nTrump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[569][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state\'s highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[570]\n\nReactions\n\nSee also\n\nArrests of Ulysses S.

He testified against the company in a criminal trial last year and was sentenced to five months in jail. The company was convicted and fined $1.6 million.\n\nThe witness list also named Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen as among the 28 witnesses the attorney general’s office intends to call.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former top executive at Trump’s company, was originally a defendant, but a state appeals court found the claims against her were too old and dismissed them.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who will preside over the jury-less bench trial in Manhattan next week, partly sided with the AG\'s office in a ruling Tuesday when he found that Trump had committed repeated acts of fraud for years. Trump attorney Christopher Kise has said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he characterized as ""outrageous.""\n\nTrump, meanwhile, blasted the judge he\'ll be testifying before as a ""Trump hating"" judge who has violated his civil rights.\n\nThe state Appellate Division — the same appeals court that dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump — had issued a temporary stay of the trial date of Monday after Trump complained that Engoron hadn’t ruled on some of his arguments. Engoron ruled on the issues Tuesday, and the appeals court allowed the case to proceed to trial Monday.\n\nJames has said Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, sparked her office’s investigation when he testified before Congress that Trump routinely exaggerated his assets in financial documents. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws and lying to banks and to Congress, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nTrump has filed a $500 million lawsuit against Cohen in Florida alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to Trump by ""both revealing Plaintiff’s confidences, and spreading falsehoods about Plaintiff."" Lawyers for Cohen were scheduled to depose Trump in Florida next week, but his attorney Alejandro Brito argued in court Thursday that Trump needs to be in New York because of the AG\'s case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres will hold another hearing Friday to determine whether to keep the date or push it back to Oct. 8 or Oct. 9. There is also a possibility the deposition could be held in New York at Trump’s request, but that would have to be approved by Cohen’s attorney.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said the deposition would still happen — it’s just a matter of when and where. Donald Trump’s attorney didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil fraud trial that begins next week in Manhattan could last until Dec. 22, the judge has said. In addition to the 28 main witnesses, the AG\'s office listed 25 more people as potential rebuttal witnesses.\n\nTrump\'s witness list, meanwhile, included 127 names of fact and expert witnesses, in addition to ""Any witness included on Plaintiff’s Witness List.""\n\nEngoron said in a ruling this month that he\'ll hear the case five days a week. James’ office will have 90 minutes for an opening statement Monday, while lawyers for the multiple Trump defendants will have two hours.\n\nTrump and his two adult sons have denied any wrongdoing. He has accused James, a Democrat, of taking part in a partisan ""witch hunt"" against him.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-civil-fraud-trial-11-06-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testifies in New York civil fraud trial | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump brought bombastic rhetoric to the witness stand Monday in the civil fraud case against him and his business, as he spent his time on the stand attacking the New York attorney general ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/66989373', 'Headline': ""Fact-checking Trump's claims about New York fraud trial - BBC"", 'Snippet': 'Trump walks out of the New York courtroom during a break in the first day of the trial on whether he committed fraud.

Here’s a look at how many people attended Trump’s rally, including crowd photos and updates about what happened.\n\nMore Than 15,000 Attended Trump’s Arizona Rally\n\nThe rally took place at the Country Thunder Festival Grounds, AZ Central reported. Trump’s speech was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. MST, with doors opening for the rally at 2 p.m. His speech began a bit later than scheduled, at about 7:17 p.m. Other speakers included Kari Lake, state Rep. Mark Finchem, Rep. Paul Gosar, Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Debbie Lesko, Kelli Ward, Mike Lindell, and Boris Epshteyn, Axios reported.\n\nIn the afternoon, just a couple of hours after doors opened, thousands of people were already at the festival grounds, AZ Central reported. The publication noted that traffic was stalled for about an hour outside the rally venue, and some attendees still hadn’t gotten inside after waiting more than three hours.\n\nYahoo! News (via the Arizona Republic) reported that more than 15,000 were in attendance at the rally. Meanwhile, Liz Willis of the right-wing network RSBN had indicated during the rally that attendance was about 20,000, according to a tweet that her official account retweeted. The Town of Florence Police Department had written on January 13 that they projected an attendance of close to 30,000.\n\nSteven Monacelli of Rolling Stone, The Daily Beast, and Dallas Weekly tweeted that when he arrived at the rally, he and other members of the press were told the press tower was full, even while others were still being let in the gates.\n\nHe later shared that although some of the press who were with him weren’t allowed inside, he was able to get into the rally.\n\nEd Henry of the conservative publication Real America’s Voice shared these photos of the crowd.\n\nWill Steakin of ABC News tweeted that Anthony Kern, a former Arizona lawmaker who was at the Capitol on January 6, addressed the crowd before Trump and told the rally: “This is our 1776 movement.”\n\nSteakin said the crowd could be heard saying “lock him up” at one point, in reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHere’s another crowd photo, shared by Monacelli on Twitter:\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, he called Biden “a disaster” for the country and let Kari Lake join him briefly on the stage. Lake is the Republican candidate for governor.\n\nHe also vowed during his speech to have his own investigation of the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nSteakin reported that Trump’s rally ended with a new song by Sam and Dave called, “Hold on I’m Coming.”\n\nOn Twitter, the video below was shared showing the crowd at the rally.\n\nTrump said in the video above that some officials indicated this might be the “single biggest crowd seen yet.” However, other Trump rallies have recorded attendance numbers larger than the current estimate of 15,000. A 2019 Minneapolis Trump rally, for example, had a low estimate of 20,000, not including overflow. Trump did add: “and they’re not just talking about Arizona,” to his statement about the crowd size.\n\nThis Was Trump’s First Rally of 2022\n\nThis was Trump’s first rally of 2022. Trump held a September rally in Georgia. He also held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October 2021, a rally in Alabama in August 2021, and an Ohio rally in June 2021.\n\nIn his August Alabama rally, he was booed after telling the people present to take the vaccines. He replied: “You know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do. But, I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it’s good. Take the vaccines.”\n\nTrump has not yet announced if he is running in the 2024 presidential election or not.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://factcheck.afp.com/misleads-attendance-trump-biden-campaign-events', 'Headline': 'Posts use photos to inaccurately compare campaign events', 'Snippet': 'The claim can also be found on Facebook here, here and here..

The event was organized by the Biden campaign and the Democratic party in Yuma. “It was a bus tour that traveled around Arizona, to the smaller cities where neither Biden nor Harris visited.”\n\nCampaign signs were handed to local Biden supporters, the journalist reported. “I didn't get a head count but I would say about 100” people were present, Calderon told AFP via email. He also said everyone wore face masks and hand sanitizer was available.\n\nDrive-in rallies and town halls via Zoom and broadcast on television have become a staple of the Democrat's mostly low-key and mostly virtual campaign, as he scrupulously adhered to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines to guard against the coronavirus.\n\nBiden has repeatedly slammed Trump's determination to rally huge crowds during the pandemic, but the president has brushed the concerns aside.\n\n“There is no excuse for President Trump's reckless behavior,” Biden tweeted on October 11.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Arizona and Iowa relatively easily but the latest polls seem to show close races in both states, and were Biden to win either it would be an upset.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/trump-rally-bubble-crowd-size/621292/', 'Headline': 'Why Trump Won’t Stop Talking About His Crowd Sizes - The Atlantic', 'Snippet': 'Now that Biden is president, Trump-rally goers say things like Trump couldn’t really have lost.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene allege the cities and several advocacy groups conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.', 'Full_text': 'Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues “on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.”\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has “not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.”\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or “coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies” and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ocregister.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/', 'Headline': 'Anaheim is being sued by GOP Reps.

This is false; the attack unfolded on live television and has resulted in hundreds of criminal charges, nor did Pelosi hire a ...', 'Full_text': '""Pelosi hiring her daughter to bring a film crew to video Jan6 proves that this day was staged and planned by the left to frame Trump and his followers,"" says an October 14, 2022 post on Gettr, a social media platform catering to conservatives, that was shared on Instagram.\n\nSimilar posts faulting Pelosi for the riot were shared across social media -- including by conservative activist Jack Posobiec and Donald Trump Jr, former president Donald Trump\'s eldest son, who claimed Pelosi denied a request from Trump for extra National Guard support.\n\n""So Nancy Pelosi refuses Trump\'s request for a national guard presence on Jan 6 & simultaneously has a documentary film crew in her office where are you can hear her poorly delivered tough guy act,"" the younger Trump wrote. ""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6. The recently released footage from Alexandra Pelosi shows Nancy Pelosi and Schumer speaking with congressional staff and US and state officials -- including then-Virginia governor Ralph Northam -- about sending National Guard reinforcements to the Capitol.\n\n""We need a full National Guard component, now,"" Schumer is seen saying in a phone call with former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nHammill said: ""The speaker was not made aware of any request for the National Guard until January 6th as the Capitol was being breached.""\n\nThe false claim about Pelosi blocking National Guard assistance appears to trace back to remarks that former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller recalled Trump making, disclosed when Miller spoke to a Vanity Fair reporter in the waning days of the Trump administration. Miller said Trump floated the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 National Guard troops at the Capitol, but Miller told the reporter he regarded it as a case of the then-president being ""hyperbolic."" Miller also told lawmakers in May 2021 about Trump making such a comment, saying it came with ""no elaboration"" during a phone call lasting fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nBut in a recording of its interview with Miller that the House committee probing the attack posted to Twitter in July 2022, Miller said that as far as direct orders went, ""there was no order from the president"" before January 6 to direct 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol.\n\nBoth Miller and McCarthy said on other occasions that while the Department of Defense approved Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 unarmed members of the DC National Guard for traffic and crowd control, no other National Guard requests were made.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/foia/2022-01-06/capitol-riot-chronology', 'Headline': 'The Capitol Riot: A Chronology | National Security Archive', 'Snippet': ""Washington, D.C., January 6, 2022 - The National Security Archive marks the one-year anniversary of the assault on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, with a meticulously researched timeline of the day's events.

Support NRA-ILA. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them. Stay tuned to this page for details on what that looks like as the federal departments mobilize against the Second Amendment in the months ahead.

Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides ...', 'Full_text': 'In a prime-time speech to the nation, President Joe Biden spoke about gun violence and his proposals to reduce it. Here, we answer common questions about some of the statistics the president cited and actions he proposed.\n\nHis remarks on June 2 were made after a spate of mass shootings within the prior three weeks in which 35 people were killed by gunman in Buffalo, New York; Uvalde, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow many firearm deaths are there in the U.S. per year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/biden-signs-gun-bill/index.html', 'Headline': 'Biden signs bipartisan gun safety bill into law: ‘God willing, it’s ...', 'Snippet': 'President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-administration-proposes-eliminating-gun-show-loophole-regulation-rcna102800', 'Headline': ""Biden administration proposes regulation to eliminate 'gun show loophole'"", 'Snippet': 'WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is proposing a rule to eliminate the so-called gun show loophole — one of the biggest attempts to regulate the sale of firearms ...'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/biden-guns-executive-actions/index.html', 'Headline': 'Here’s what Biden has done on guns and what advocacy groups say ... - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Ghost guns Biden announced a new regulation to contain the use of so-called ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that do not have serial numbers and are difficult to track and regulate ...'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html', 'Headline': 'By 5-4 Vote, Supreme Court Revives Biden’s Regulation of ‘Ghost Guns’', 'Snippet': 'Reporting from Washington.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration proposes new federal standards for nursing home care.

These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details). For each transmission parameterization scenario, we simulated infection curves with zero-implementation as benchmark.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39638-4', 'Headline': 'Swift and extensive Omicron outbreak in China after sudden exit from ...', 'Snippet': 'It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that ...', 'Full_text': 'Understanding the official case count data during the different phases of public health policy\n\nWe first aimed to understand the spread of the Omicron variant in China immediately before the relaxation of zero-COVID (i.e., between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, 2022). Under zero-COVID, testing was mandatory and frequent, leading the official case count data to be a reliable portrayal of the levels of COVID-19 infection in China. Despite the strict measures, such as frequent city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals, the data show a clear exponential increase in COVID-19 cases (caused by the extremely transmissible Omicron variants) shortly before the relaxation of zero-COVID (Fig. 1a). Using a negative binomial regression, we estimated the rate of this exponential growth to be 0.14/day (95% CI: [0.13, 0.15]/day) during this period.\n\nOfficial data after Nov. 11 (when zero-COVID was replaced by 20 Measures and subsequently 10 Measures) report that growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic slowed (Fig. 1a), and eventually the official daily reported cases declined after Nov. 27. This pattern is unexpected. Presumably, the relaxation of strict interventions under zero-COVID would lead to more rapid spread, contrary to what is observed from the official case count data. We reason that the only plausible explanation is the cessation of the requirement for mass testing and rigorous reporting, which led to a rapid decoupling of the surveillance data from the epidemic intensity. As a result, the official case count data after Nov. 11 reflect the rapidly declining detection rate rather than real change in the infection dynamics.\n\nEstimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Nov. and Dec. 2022\n\nTo compensate for the under-reported official case count data after Nov. 11, we collected results from a large online survey conducted on Dec. 26, 2022 by a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security13. The survey reported the fraction of individuals in three categories: those who thought they had never been infected, thought they currently had COVID-19 symptoms, or thought they had been but were no longer symptomatic (see “Methods” for details). Note that these survey categories do not directly correspond to the epidemiological states of susceptible, infected, and recovered, because each person is reporting based on symptoms and does not know their true infectiousness status. In particular, individuals may become infectious before their symptoms begin, and their symptoms may linger even after they are no longer infectious. When interpreted correctly, however, these data should provide insight into the epidemic stage and thus allow inference of the epidemic dynamics.\n\nWe developed an expanded susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that mapped reporting based on symptoms to true infection status. The states of the model are explained in Fig. 2, and equations and further details are provided in “Methods”. We separated the model into three time periods to allow changes in official policy to affect the transmission rate (Fig. 1a). Official case counts were reliable for the first period, up to Nov. 11, due to mandatory and frequent testing. There is no clear observation for the second period, so we simply assumed the transmission rate must be no less than in the first period. The dynamics of the third period were then mainly determined by the population survey data on Dec. 26.\n\nOur model assumes no pre-existing population immunity against Omicron. We calculated the levels of vaccine-induced population immunity against Omicron infection based on published vaccination data14 and the decay of vaccine effectiveness against infection15 (see “Methods” and Fig. S2). We found that the population immunity before the Dec. 2022 wave of Omicron was below 0.1%, and thus would have negligible effect on the model inference.\n\nFitting the model to the case count and survey data, we estimated that the outbreak in China grew exponentially at a rate of 0.15/day (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.13, 0.15]/day) under zero-COVID between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, increased slightly to 0.17 [0.14, 0.17]/day under 20 Measures, and increased dramatically to 0.42 [0.35, 0.44]/day immediately after full exit from zero-COVID (Fig. 1c), with the epidemic then peaking around Dec. 23 (Fig. 1d). This translates to an epidemic doubling time of 4.7 [4.5, 5.4] days, 4.2 [4.0, 5.0] days, and 1.6 [1.6, 2.0] days for the three periods, respectively.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days for Omicron16 (see “Methods”), we calculated the reproductive number, Rexp, during the exponential increase stage of the three periods. It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that the zero-COVID policy prior to relaxation suppressed the transmission of these Omicron variants by 56% [46%, 64%].\n\nOur results suggest that on Dec. 7, the day when full exit from zero-COVID was announced, there were ~1 million new infections. Because of the extremely high rate of spread afterwards, the outbreak ballooned such that 97% [95%, 99%] of the population (i.e., 1.37 billion people) became infected in December. As a result of the exponential nature of the spread, the vast majority of people (88% [83%, 93%] of the population) became infected during the short window of time between Dec. 15 and 31, 2022 (Fig. 1d).\n\nRobustness to model and data assumptions\n\nWe tested the robustness of our findings—particularly, that nearly the entire population became infected in Dec. 2022—to many properties of the data and model.\n\nFirst, we previously assumed that the numbers of confirmed cases from Oct. 28 to Nov. 11 represented the actual number of infected individuals, i.e., that the case reporting rate in China was 100%. This is a reasonable approximation because of the mandatory mass testing in place: all individuals were required to get tested every 2–5 days. However, it is possible that some infected individuals were not detected. We therefore considered an alternative in which the reporting rate was only 50%. Here, the estimated growth rate after Dec. 7 was reduced slightly to 0.40/day, the size of the susceptible population by the end of Dec. remained below 4%, and the epidemic again peaked on Dec. 23 (Fig. S3).\n\nSecond, we previously assumed the Dec. 26 survey results were an unbiased random sample of the entire population. If, however, recovered people were more likely to respond to the survey, or people reported symptoms not due to COVID-19 (e.g., instead due to influenza—an unlikely scenario given the recent report by China CDC5), the numbers of symptomatic or recovered individuals would be over-reported and our growth rate estimate would be too high. We therefore made a large perturbation of the Dec. 26 data by moving 20% of people from each of the symptomatic and recovered categories into the uninfected category. The estimated growth rate was then reduced slightly to 0.39/day after Dec. 7, the size of the susceptible population by Dec. 31 remained below 4%, and the epidemic peak moved slightly to Dec. 24 (Fig. S4).\n\nThird, in our inference of the transmission rates, we fixed many parameter values from the literature. We tested the sensitivity of our results to those assumed values by re-fitting the model using different values. In one strategy, we set the value of each state transition parameter (kE, kIP, kIS, kS, kA, and kT; all defined in Fig. 2, Table S3, Eq. 1) to either 25% higher or lower than our baseline value (Fig. S5). In another strategy, we assigned an appropriate amount of uncertainty to the incubation period, pre-symptomatic period, symptomatic period, generation interval, and time to PCR testing, drew values from each distribution, and derived the state transition parameters (details in Table S3); this was repeated 25 times. In all cases, the median exponential growth rate remained above 0.25/day after Dec. 7, the median size of the population still susceptible by Dec. 31 remained <6% and the 95% CrI remained <10%, and the epidemic peak remained between Dec. 21–25.\n\nFourth, we previously assumed that the entire population is well-mixed. If, however, population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection, such as people who live in urban areas or younger age groups) were also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. To test the impact of population structure on our conclusions, we extended our model to build a meta-population model with two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates. We assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. We considered various scenarios with different assumptions about the contact rates between the two subpopulations and the contact rate in the unsampled population (see Fig. S6 and “Methods”). In general, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and that >90% of the entire population was infected by the end of Dec. (Fig. S7), consistent with our main findings. This suggests that for a virus that transmits extremely efficiently and rapidly, like Omicron, population structure and heterogeneity play only a small role in dictating the overall rate and magnitude of the epidemic, as long as subpopulations are not entirely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, allowing for under-reporting of official case count data before Nov. 11, over-reporting of symptoms in the Dec. 26 survey, uncertainty in parameter values taken from the literature, or population sub-structure did not change our conclusions.\n\nModel validation using additional datasets\n\nWe furthermore validated our results by comparing them against datasets and analyses that were not used in the inference above. First, China CDC subsequently released data on voluntary PCR and antigen tests for most of Dec. 2022 and Jan. 20235. After the full exit from zero-COVID, the test strategy was changed from all population-based to those who request to be tested and groups at risk. The total number of tests declined from a peak of 150 million tests on Dec. 9, to 7.54 million on Jan. 1. The test positivity rate ranged between a few percent to a peak of 29.4% on Dec. 255. Although these data may not directly reveal the magnitude of the true case counts because of the voluntary nature of the reports, they can reveal the pace and the peak timing of the epidemic. We adjusted our model predictions to reflect the nature of voluntary tests (see “Methods”), and found surprisingly close agreement with the national testing data in Dec. 2022 (Fig. 3).\n\nSecond, the Sichuan CDC conducted a large daily survey in which residents of the province reported their infection status, the date of test positivity, and the date of symptom onset17. We found that the exponential growth rate of the epidemic in early Dec. in Sichuan, as measured by test positivity or symptom onset (0.37/day or 0.43/day, respectively; Fig. S8) is remarkably consistent with our estimates above for the country as a whole.\n\nThird, an analysis of self-reported infection rate focused on vaccine efficacy but also reported an epidemic curve18. Based on 2316 survey responses, the study reported that 82.4% of people in China had confirmed cases by Feb. 2023. This number excludes, however, asymptomatic cases that were not revealed by testing. If 9% of infected people never developed symptoms (median value from Fig. S1) and most of those cases were not caught by testing (due to the lack of mandatory testing and the lack of incentive for most non-symptomatic people to test themselves, leading to the high test positivity rate by end-Dec5.), it is likely that more than 90% of people in that survey had been infected. The small sample size of that survey would also induce large uncertainty, leading to a result for the final epidemic size that is not inconsistent with our model-based analysis on larger datasets.\n\nWe modeled the epidemic dynamics of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in China from Nov. to Dec. 2022, during a period when China moved from having strict COVID-19 policies (‘zero-COVID’), to little-to-no intervention efforts. We found that after full exit from zero-COVID, the Omicron variant spread at a very high rate of 0.42/day, with a doubling time of 1.6 days, during early and mid-Dec. before the incidence peaked around Dec. 23. Our point estimate is that 97% of the population (1.4 billion people) was infected during December, with a lower 95% credibility interval of 95% of the population (1.33 billion) and a lower limit in the sensitivity analyses of 90% (1.26 billion). With an infection fatality ratio between 0.1 and 0.2% for the Omicron variant19, we would expect between 1.3 and 2.6 million COVID-19 deaths in China during Dec. 2022 as well as Jan. 2023 (because of the delay from infection to death).\n\nInfection of more than one billion people during one month would lead to a large number of people needing health care, far exceeding the hospital capacity, and thus explains the report that hospitals were overwhelmed during this period6. This outcome emphasizes the need for gradually relaxing intervention efforts (instead of abruptly changing policy) and implementing additional measures (e.g., pharmaceutical strategies) to ‘flatten the curve’9. A slower epidemic wave would help to ease hospital burden, allow sufficient health care for infected people, prevent epidemic overshoot (i.e., a large final epidemic size because of rapid spread20), and ultimately reduce the number of deaths. Such considerations may be of renewed importance later in 2023, when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 may become susceptible to reinfection.\n\nOur results differ from a recent paper by Leung et al.21 that modeled the epidemic dynamics in Beijing over a similar period. First, they estimated that the highest rate of epidemic growth occurred in mid-Nov., a period when substantial intervention efforts were still in place, whereas our estimates suggest the rate of epidemic growth was highest after the full exit from zero-COVID. Second, they estimated that the epidemic incidence in Beijing had two peaks (one on Dec. 10 and another on Dec. 21), whereas we estimated the epidemic in China as a whole peaked on Dec. 23, remarkably consistent with the newly released data from China CDC5 (Fig. 3). These results in Leung et al.21 are strongly driven by the assumption that the overall contact rate is a function of the daily number of subway travelers, which peaked mid-November. However, it is unclear how the number of subway passengers is related to transmission, given that a large fraction of transmission likely occurs in the household22. More generally, it has been shown that human mobility after the first wave of the epidemic in 2020 relates to changes in transmission in complex ways23; the relationship between the mobility measures and transmission can be insignificant in many countries, country-specific, or intervention policy-specific. As a result, the results in Leung et al.21 could be biased by this strong assumption.\n\nOne limitation of our analysis is that it is heavily dependent on the online infection status survey data on Dec. 26. We directly addressed two concerns about these data. First, the survey could over-state the progression of the epidemic if people with symptoms are more likely to take the survey, or if people mistake influenza for COVID-19 symptoms. Recent data from the China CDC report5 shows that among individuals who had influenza-like illnesses and were tested for both COVID-19 and influenza, only a very small fraction were positive for influenza, especially in late Dec. Nevertheless, we artificially increased the proportion of uninfected people in the survey and obtained very similar results. Second, because the survey was conducted online, the demographic characteristics of the participants may be different from the general population. In particular, if a substantial subpopulation did not participate in the survey and also experienced lower rates of spread—for example, people living in sparsely populated areas—our estimate of the total number of people infected could be too high. We tested this assumption by fitting a structured population model and obtained very similar results. Finally, we validated our model findings against other data sources that were not used in our model inference. We found strong concordance with both the estimated peak time of the epidemic and its growth trajectory. These many lines of evidence strongly suggest that our estimation is reliable and robust, despite the limitations of the available data.\n\nAnother piece of evidence supporting our conclusion is the lack of a COVID-19 wave in January 2023 (for example, see the China CDC report5). The Chinese New Year travel rush, i.e., during which many migrant workers and students go back to hometown to celebrate the Chinese New Year, occurred in Jan., and a large fraction of these travel routes would be from cities to rural villages. Presumably, this travel rush would increase the frequency of risky contact substantially throughout China. The fact that there is no indication of any sizable COVID outbreak during this period (e.g., indicators of COVID-19 infection, including positive tests and fever clinic visits, decreased continuously throughout Jan. 20235) strongly suggests that a large majority of individuals are already infected in Dec., as we predicted in the model.\n\nBroader implications for understanding the transmission of the Omicron variant and for public health\n\nUnlike most other countries where there existed sizable levels of population immunity against the Omicron variant arising from recent natural infection and/or vaccination, we estimated that the population in China had very little to no protection against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the growth rate 0.42/day (translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days) during the exponential growth period we estimated may be a good approximation of the intrinsic transmissibility of the variants BA.5 and BF.7 in a densely populated area without population immunity. This is in stark contrast to the growth rate 0.29/day (and an epidemic doubling time of 2.4 days) that we estimated for the Wuhan outbreak before intervention efforts were in place in Jan. 202024. This highlights the extremely high intrinsic transmissibility of the Omicron variant in a naive population.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days16, we estimated the reproductive number during exponential growth, Rexp to be 3.1. Note that a recent study using contact tracing data from Italy estimated the intrinsic generation time to be 6.8 days25, although the realized generation time for household transmission where frequent contacts occur between family members was 3.6 days. This relatively large difference in the estimated generation times suggests another layer of complexity in calculating the reproductive number, i.e., it depends on whether the transmission is mostly driven by household transmission (frequent contacts) or non-household transmission (less frequent contacts), which may change in different epidemiological contexts and epidemic stages. The reproductive number, Rexp, we calculated here is likely accurate when the transmission is dominated by household transmission, e.g., when prevalence is relatively high in a community. However, at the beginning of an epidemic when only a few individuals are infected, the transmission is likely to be a mixture of household and non-household transmission; in this case, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be higher than Rexp we estimated here.\n\nQuantifying the growth rates before and after zero-COVID, we estimated these intervention efforts reduced the transmission of the Omicron variant by around 56%. As a comparison, the effect of lock-down during the spread of the original variant in early 2020 was estimated to be 70–80% in Europe26. Interestingly, the Omicron outbreak in China had already been growing in Nov. 2022 before the relaxation of zero-COVID (albeit at a low rate). This may reflect the high transmissibilty of the variant, and that the stringent measures of the zero-COVID policy were not effectively implemented because of factors such as population noncompliance due to pandemic fatigue. Nonetheless, these results highlight the difficulty of containing a respiratory infection that causes explosive outbreaks and transmits during the presymptomatic or asymptomatic period.\n\nBecause the epidemic grew so rapidly in Dec., we may expect another sizable wave of infection later in 2023 when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 become susceptible to reinfection. The timing and magnitude of the future wave would depend on how quickly the population immunity wanes over time27,28,29 and the ability of newly emerging variants to evade the immunity caused by the Omicron variants30,31. Therefore, modeling efforts that evaluate intervention strategies, including vaccination, will be crucial to reduce the level of infection and mortality.\n\nDatasets and sources\n\nOfficial case counts\n\nNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China had been releasing reports on COVID-19 infections from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 23, 202232. These reports include numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, imported and recovered infections, and deaths across the country. Because the definitions of ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ infections have been changing over time, we use only the total number of cases by summing the two categories. We retrieved all official data from Sina Pandemic Map33, which provides pre-processed and well-organized daily case data from NHC. Note the NHC data are also used as a source for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard34.\n\nPrevalence survey on Dec. 26, 2022\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2022, the RenSheTong online platform (https://m12333.cn), a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, conducted a one-day online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in China13. There were 47,897 participants in total. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was reported in four categories. ‘Uninfected’ was defined as individuals who had never tested positive or were unaware they were infected. ‘Asymptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive, but did not have symptoms of infection at the time of the survey. ‘Symptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they were infected, and were experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey. ‘Recovered’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they had been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had recovered from symptoms of infection. We interpreted the last category to imply recovered from recent infection, i.e., in end-2022, but there would be little consequence if it also included people who had been infected in previous years because <1% of the population had been infected prior to Nov. 202234. Survey questions are reproduced in Table S2 and survey results by province are provided in a supplemental data file. Because of the small number of respondents in the Asymptomatic category, our analyses folded them in with the Uninfected category, which already included individuals who could be infected but without symptoms. Note that in the survey 95% of infected people reported symptoms, which is consistent with the fraction of infections estimated to be symptomatic by our model (Fig. S1). We computed the total number of people in each survey category under the assumption that the proportion of survey respondents in each category was representative of the respective province as a whole. That is, the prevalences in Fig. 1b are the country’s total population size multiplied by 28.3% Uninfected, 42.5% Infected, and 29.2% Recovered.\n\nParticipants in the survey were also asked about the duration of symptoms. We fitted an Erlang distribution to the survey data by estimating the mean of the distribution and adjusting the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution from 1 to 10.\n\nChinese CDC reports of number of positive tests after Dec. 9, 2022\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released national COVID-19 pandemic data on Jan. 25, 2023, including PCR test results, antigen test results, outpatient and inpatient data, variant surveillance data, and vaccination progress across the country5. Data were collected from official surveillance systems, labs, hospitals, and mobile applications where residents could upload their antigen test results voluntarily. We used daily numbers of positive PCR and antigen tests and daily test positivity rates.\n\nSichuan survey on Dec. 25 and 26, 2022\n\nThe Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Health conducted an online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in Sichuan province on Dec. 24 and 2517. There were a total of 158,506 participants. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was categorized as ‘uninfected’ or ‘tested positive either by PCR or antigen test.’ In addition, participants reported the date that they tested positive and the date of their symptom onset.\n\nCopies of all datasets are included as supplemental files.\n\nThe expanded SEIR model\n\nWe developed an SEIR-type model to encompass not only the daily case counts from extensive official testing, but also the survey data in which respondents’ answers were based on symptoms. In this model, we categorized the population into 12 classes, plus 2 additional classes for bookkeeping: S for susceptible, E1 and E2 for exposed, IP for pre-symptomatic and infectious, IS for symptomatic and infectious, RS1, RS2, and RS3 for recovered from infectiousness but still symptomatic, RS for recovered and no longer with symptoms, IA1 and IA2 for asymptomatic and infectious, and RA for recovered and never having symptoms. Multiple stages were used for some categories (e.g., stages E1 and E2 for the exposed category) in order to obtain more realistic distributions of waiting times35, as discussed below. States T1 and T2 were used to record individuals who test positive, in order to compare with daily case counts. Figure 2 shows how individuals transit from one class to another. Parameters ki govern the rates of flow from one class to the next, f is the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms, and w is the proportion of cases found by testing. The system of equations defining this model is:\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N$$\n\n(1a)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{1}}{dt}=\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N-{k}_{E}{E}_{1}$$\n\n(1b)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{E}{E}_{1}-{k}_{E}{E}_{2}$$\n\n(1c)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{P}}{dt}={k}_{E}f{E}_{2}-{k}_{IP}{I}_{P}$$\n\n(1d)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{IP}{I}_{P}-{k}_{IS}{I}_{S}$$\n\n(1e)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S1}}{dt}={k}_{IS}{I}_{S}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S1}$$\n\n(1f)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S2}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S1}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S2}$$\n\n(1g)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S3}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S2}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1h)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1i)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A1}}{dt}={k}_{E}(1-f){E}_{2}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A1}$$\n\n(1j)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A2}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A1}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1k)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{A}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1l)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{1}}{dt}={k}_{E}w{E}_{2}-{k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1m)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1n)\n\nIn this model, susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals (in compartments IP + IS + IA1 + IA2) through contacts at rate β. Infected individuals first become exposed but not infectious. We used two compartments (E1 and E2) to model this period to reflect the fact that the distribution of the exposed period (i.e., from infection to becoming infectious) usually follows a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution. Exposed individuals then become infectious, and IP and IS represent infectious individuals at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively. Individuals lose infectiousness a few days after symptom onset36, whereas symptoms may last for a longer period of time. Stages RS1, RS2, and RS3 describe symptomatic individuals who are no longer infectious. Again, using three stages allows us to match the distribution of the symptomatic period to the distribution estimated from data13. Note that, in the survey, participants in the ‘infected’ category were categorized based on whether the participants have COVID symptoms or not. Therefore, the ‘infected’ category corresponds to individuals in the states IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3. When individuals recover from symptoms, they enter state RS.\n\nOur model also keeps track of asymptomatically infected individuals, i.e., individuals who never develop symptoms throughout infection. In the model, we assume a fraction, 1 − f, of individuals remain asymptomatic after the exposed period. We use two IA stages to describe the duration of infectious period as a gamma distribution. RA keeps track of individuals recovered from asymptomatic infection. We do not differentiate the stages of individuals recovering from asymptomatic infection (as we did for individuals recovering from symptomatic infection) because individuals in all of these stages would have reported as the same category in the symptoms-based survey, and they remain in this class.\n\nOverall, our model structure allowed us to map our model states to the categories in the Dec. 26 online survey. People who reported themselves ‘uninfected’ could be truly susceptible (S), asymptomatic but exposed (E1, E2) or infected (IA1, IA2), or recovered never having had symptoms (RA). People who reported themselves ‘infected’ were experiencing symptoms, so they could be still infectious (IS) or no longer infectious (RS1, RS2, RS3). People reporting themselves ‘recovered’ were no longer experiencing symptoms (RS).\n\nTo fit the model to official COVID-19 case counts, we used T1 and T2 to keep track of individuals who would eventually be tested. Note that they do not contribute to the transmission dynamics. Parameter w is the fraction of infected individuals who are tested, and it ranges between 0 and 1. The waiting time from becoming infectious to being tested positive is 1/kT.\n\nParameter values and statistical inference\n\nWe fixed most of the parameters in the model to values estimated from epidemiological studies. We used an incubation period for Omicron of mean 3.4 days37 and a generation interval for Omicron of mean 3.3 days16. Both distributions can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 3, so in our model there are three states describing individuals who are infected but yet to develop symptoms (E1, E2, and IP). We then set the rate parameters kE = 2/1.9 /day and kIP = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean pre-symptomatic infectious period is 1.5 days38 and total incubation period is 3.4 days37, and kIS = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean infectious period after symptom onset is 1.5 days.\n\nWe estimated from the population survey data (Table S2) that the distribution of the symptomatic period can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.7 days and a shape parameter of 413. Therefore, in our model, we used four states to represent the symptomatic period (IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3), and we set kS = 3/4.2 /day such that the mean duration that an individual is in the RS1, RS2 or RS3 state is 4.2 days and thus the mean symptomatic period is 4.2 + 1.5 = 5.7 days. We also set 2/kA = 1/kIP + 1/kIS such that the mean infectious period of the asymptomatically infected is assumed the same as symptomatically infected. Parameter values are summarized in Table S3.\n\nOur model contained six free parameters: the transmission rate during each of the three periods (βi), the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms (f), an initial number of exposed individuals in mid-Oct. (E0), and an overdispersion parameter for the count data (ϕ), which were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.\n\nFor the initial condition of the ODE system, we assumed an entirely susceptible population except for E1 = E2 ≡ E0 on Oct. 22, one week before the beginning of the case count data we fit. This is consistent with very little pre-existing immunity through either prior natural infection (<1% of the population had ever been infected by this time34) or vaccination (Fig. S2). The model was fit using Bayesian inference and implemented in the Stan programming language39. We set the prior distribution of each βi to be normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 2, the prior on f to be uniform between 0 and 1, the prior on E0 to be uniform between 1 and ten times the number of cases on the first day of data, and the prior on ϕ−1 to be exponential with mean 5. These are weak priors, and the posterior estimates (shown in Fig. S1) were not sensitive to them.\n\nThe growth rate, r, during the exponential growth period of the outbreak was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the ODE system, Eq. 1, assuming the population is fully susceptible (i.e., S = N).\n\nCalculation of the reproductive number during exponential growth, R exp\n\nWe used the growth rates, r, of SARS-CoV-2 in China estimated in this study and the distribution of the intrinsic generation interval to calculate the reproductive number Rexp. This is the estimated instantaneous reproductive number during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak after Dec. 8 and before the peak. According to Abbott et al.16, the distribution of the generation interval has a mean of 3.3 days and a shape parameter close to 3. Rexp is then calculated using the formula provided in Park et al.40:\n\n$${R}_{exp}=\\frac{1}{\\int\\,g(\\tau )\\exp (-r\\tau )d\\tau }$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g is the density function of the intrinsic generation interval distribution.\n\nRegression to estimate exponential growth rates\n\nThe rates of exponential growth in Sichuan province during Dec. 2022 were estimated by fitting a linear regression model to the fractions of COVID-19-positive individuals or individuals whose symptoms began between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The Dec. 1 data point was ignored because it is likely to include individuals who tested positive or started to have symptoms before Dec. 1. The fitting was performed using the lm() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nWe estimated the rate of exponential growth using the official case count data by fitting a generalized negative binomial regression to the case count time series. Fitting was performed with the glm.nb() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nEstimating population immunity against Omicron infection\n\nLau et al.15 estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the CoronaVac vaccine against Omicron infection: 7 days following immunization, the VE for the second and third doses were 5% (0–27%) and 30% (1–66%), respectively, and then the VE reduced exponentially to 1% (0–11%) and 6% (0–29%), respectively, 100 days after immunization. We used these values in our calculation, assuming that all the vaccines administered in China follow the same VE characteristics as CoronaVac. We then collected data on the fractions of people who already received two doses or three doses of vaccine over time from ref. 14 (Fig. S2a). From this dataset, we estimated the fractions of people newly vaccinated with their second or third dose over the entire period of consideration. Note that the fourth dose of vaccine was not authorized in China until mid-Dec. 2022, and therefore we did not include the fourth dose in our calculation.\n\nWe calculated the population immunity against Omicron on day d, P(d), as\n\n$$P(d)=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i={d}_{0}}^{d}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=2}^{3}{G}_{j}(d-i){Q}_{j}(i)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qj(i) is the fraction newly vaccinated with the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i, and Gj(d − i) is the VE on day d given an individual received the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i. The expected and upper bound estimates (Fig. S2b) were made using the expected and upper bound estimates of the VE.\n\nRobustness of conclusions to existence of population structure\n\nWe considered the impact of population structure on the main conclusions of our model. If population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection) are also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. For example, people who live in urban areas with good internet access and health care facilities may be more likely to be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey, while also experiencing more opportunity for infection; whereas people living in rural areas (far away from testing facilities and with poor internet connections) may not be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey. Another example is that people in younger age groups may have larger numbers of contacts and be more likely to participate in online surveys than people in older age groups.\n\nTo capture this effect as simply as possible, we included two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates, with an even lower rate of contact between the two subpopulations. Specifically, we assumed that during each time period, the transmission rate in the low-contact subpopulation was half that of the high-contact subpopulation, and the transmission rate between subpopulations was one-tenth as large. We also assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. The full model structure is provided in Fig. S6.\n\nWe first partitioned the entire country’s population to be 65% in the high-contact subpopulation and 35% in the low-contact subpopulation. This partition is motivated by the nationwide urban–rural proportion. Because the Dec. 26 survey includes participants from both urban and rural areas, this division represents an overestimate of the size of the unsampled population. Indeed, the majority of population in China has good internet access (through cell phones) and access to COVID-testing sites. Therefore we additionally considered a model where the population is partitioned to be 80% in the high-contact subpopulation and 20% in the low-contact subpopulation, which is probably more appropriate with respect to the survey data. We fit both models to the official case count data and the Dec. 26 survey data as in the main text. Irrespective of the partition, our results from this model were consistent with our main findings. For the 80%–20% and 65%–35% partitions, respectively, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and only 2.6% or 6.7% of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of December (Fig. S7ab).\n\nWe further tested a scenario where the partition is 80% and 20% for the sampled and unsampled subpopulations, respectively, and transmission between the subpopulations was only one-hundredth of the transmission rate within the sampled subpopulation. Note that this is an extreme and unlikely scenario where the two subpopulations were not well connected at all. We found that infection in the low-contact subpopulation lagged behind the high-contact subpopulation even more than in the previous scenarios, as expected (Fig. S7c). The amount of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of Dec. increased slightly to 10.9%, and the epidemic peak remained on Dec. 23.\n\nModel adjustment for testing intensity and willingness in the China CDC data\n\nWe compared the fitted model trajectory against the China CDC data to validate our model estimations. For this, we multiplied the total cases predicted by the model by a factor to correct for testing effort and the willingness to get tested. We defined\n\n$$T=C\\frac{{n}_{T}/{p}_{T}}{(N-R)v},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the model-adjusted inferred number of positive tests (plotted as colored bands in Fig. 3), C is the total number of model-predicted cases (gray band in Fig. 3), nT is the number of positive tests, pT is the test positivity rate, N is the total country population size, R is the number of individuals in the recovered non-symptomatic model states (RS + RA), and v is an unknown factor related to the proportion of the population that engages in voluntary testing. The term (N − R)v reflects that not all individuals engage in the testing and among those who engage, individuals who know they are recovered likely do not get tested or self-test any more. Values of all the quantities in Eq. (4) are known for each day—from the model fit or the reported data—except for v. We estimated a single value of v (across all days) for each testing type by least-squares fitting, using Eq. (4), obtaining v = 0.44 for the PCR tests and v = 0.52 for the antigen tests.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00191-7', 'Headline': 'China’s zero-COVID strategy: what happens next? - Nature', 'Snippet': 'China’s stringent zero-COVID strategy is likely to face its toughest test yet in the next few weeks, as millions of people travel around the country for Chinese New Year, and the Winter Olympics ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Covid', 'Headline': 'Zero-COVID - Wikipedia', 'Snippet': 'Zero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bankrate.com/loans/small-business/can-a-business-owner-collect-unemployment/', 'Headline': 'Can You Get Unemployment If You Have A Side Business?', 'Snippet': 'There are states, however, that allow you to earn up to a certain percentage of your total weekly unemployment benefits from a side business or part-time job without it impacting or reducing the ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/data-deep-dive-how-government-benefits-programs-are-contributing-to-the-labor-shortage', 'Headline': 'Data Deep Dive: How Government Benefits Programs Are ... - U.S. Chamber ...', 'Snippet': 'A new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation takes a closer look at benefit cliffs and how proposed policy changes have affected the labor market when implemented in various states.

In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories ...', 'Full_text': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.\n\nNorris says the bad blood between them began in 2015, when Babbitt engaged in a monthslong extramarital affair with Norris’ longtime live-in boyfriend. When she learned of the relationship, Norris called Babbitt’s husband and told him she was cheating.\n\n“She pulls up yelling and screaming,” Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, road-rage incident in Prince Frederick, Maryland. “It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was. … Just all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.”\n\nTerrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.\n\nThe attack on Norris is an example of erratic and sometimes threatening behavior by Babbitt, who was shot by a police officer while at the vanguard of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray her as a righteous martyr who was unjustly killed.\n\nTrump has called her “an incredible person” and he even taped a posthumous birthday greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.\n\nBut the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.\n\nIn the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was fatally shot while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol, where police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the mob supporting Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was one of five people who died during or immediately after the riot, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included videos of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.\n\nHer Twitter account, which was taken down after her death, was rife with references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump has secretly battled deep-state enemies and a cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals that includes prominent Democrats who operate a child sex trafficking ring.\n\n“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”\n\nAmong Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.\n\nA Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.\n\nKey to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.\n\nAaron Babbitt declined to comment in October when a reporter knocked on the door of the San Diego apartment he shared with Ashli and another woman. In a June interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Babbitt said he has been sickened by some of what he has seen written about his deceased wife.\n\n“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.\n\nThat is not how Norris felt about her.\n\nCourt records involving the violent 2016 confrontation between Babbitt and Norris have previously been reported by media outlets, including the AP. But Norris, now 39, agreed to speak about it publicly for the first time in an interview with the AP and shared previously unreported details. She also provided documents and photos from the crash scene to support her account.\n\nNorris was in a six-year relationship with Aaron Babbitt when she said she learned he was cheating on her with a married co-worker from his job as a security guard at a nuclear power plant near the Chesapeake Bay. She eventually found out the other woman was Ashli McEntee, who at the time went by the last name of her then-husband.\n\n“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”\n\nWhen she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.\n\n“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.\n\nNorris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.\n\nA few weeks later, Norris was waiting at a stop sign in Prince Frederick, about an hour southeast of Washington, D.C., when she says a white Ford Explorer passed her going the other direction.\n\nNorris saw the SUV pulling a U-turn before speeding up behind her. She recounts that the SUV’s driver began swerving erratically, laying on the horn and attempting to pass a Chevrolet Suburban that was in between them on the narrow two-lane road.\n\nWhen the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.\n\nAfter Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.\n\nNorris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.\n\nA case report from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office obtained by the AP shows Ashli Babbitt was issued a criminal summons on charges of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor defined under Maryland law as engaging in conduct “that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another” and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. She was also charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to Norris’ vehicle.\n\nCourt records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.\n\nPhotos from the scene provided to the AP by Norris show Babbitt’s white Ford Explorer with its front bumper smashed in. The SUV’s grill is also pushed in and the hood dented. The rear bumper of Norris’ Escape is pushed in on the passenger side, with the detached Maryland license plate from the front bumper of Babbitt’s SUV wedged into it.\n\nFollowing the altercation, Norris and a friend went to the courthouse in neighboring St. Mary’s County, where she lived at the time, and petitioned for a peace order, a type of restraining order, against Ashli Babbitt. The resulting judicial order barred Ashli Babbitt from attempting to contact Norris, committing further acts of violence against her and going to her home or workplace.\n\nA copy of the order, dated the same day as the altercation, contains Norris’ contemporaneous account of what occurred, as written down by her friend. Norris’ hands were still shaking so badly she couldn’t write down what happened for herself, according to a note on the document.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Norris said, Babbitt falsely claimed to authorities that the collisions had occurred when Norris repeatedly backed her vehicle into Babbitt’s SUV. But when the case went to trial, Norris said, Babbitt changed her story, admitting under oath that she had collided with Norris’ vehicle but portraying it as an accident.\n\nNo transcript from the hearing was available, but Norris said the lawyer defending Babbitt made repeated references to her employment at the local nuclear power plant and years of military service, which included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Babbitt served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and then in the reserves and the Air National Guard until 2016. A judge acquitted Babbitt on the criminal charges.\n\nIn February 2017, records show Norris asked for and received a second peace order against Ashli Babbitt, citing ongoing harassment and stalking. In a handwritten petition, Norris says that Babbitt had recently followed her home from work and that she had also received repeated calls in the middle of the night from an unlisted number.\n\n“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”\n\nIn 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBy then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.\n\nAshli posted on Facebook that she married Aaron Babbitt the following month. Records show the couple owned a pool cleaning service with Ashli’s brother. When a reporter visited the business the day after her death, a large sign on the locked door declared the building to be “Mask Free Autonomous Zone Better Known as America.”\n\nIn the year since Babbitt’s death, Trump and many Republicans in Congress have sought to recast the Jan. 6 insurrection as nonviolent — a contention directly contradicted by hours of video footage and the public testimony of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.\n\nIn his video on Babbitt’s birthday, Trump also said: “Together we grieve her terrible loss. There was no reason Ashli should have lost her life that day. We must all demand justice for Ashli and her family, so on this solemn occasion as we celebrate her life, we renew our call for a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the death of Ashli Babbitt.”\n\nAaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”\n\n“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.\n\nThe Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, said in a televised interview in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck\n\n___\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at [email protected].\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the interviewer’s surname is Carlson, not Carson.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'claim: ashli babbitt was killed by an officer working for democrats Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the ...', 'Full_text': 'Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.\n\nYet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.\n\nBy excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob’s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump’s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.\n\nSpread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.\n\nSeveral different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.\n\nConspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\n\n“If we’re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it’s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,” Carnahan said. “It will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we’re seeing right now.”\n\nAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS\n\nIn fact, many of those who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — proudly, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nDifferent versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\n\n“Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,” Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”\n\nThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.\n\nAnother Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven’t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.\n\nYet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”\n\nCarlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\n\n“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.\n\nSpokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.\n\nIn truth, the rioters are just who they said they were.\n\nOne was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\n\n“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans said on the video. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate’s certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump’s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”\n\n“We have not seen evidence of that,” said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT\n\nDozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.\n\nRioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.\n\nThat’s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.\n\nAppearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\n\n“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.\n\nTrump called the insurrection a display of “ spirit and faith and love.”\n\nRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose.\n\n“The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,” Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. “And, you know, I won’t be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.”\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS\n\nTrump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nImmediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been “cheated” and “defrauded” in the “rigged” election by a “criminal enterprise” that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol.\n\nAt one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric.\n\n“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\n\n“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBabbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An investigation cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.\n\n“Who is the person that shot … an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED\n\nNo, they are not, despite some assertions from members of Congress.\n\n“J6 defendants are political prisoners of war,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted in November. She said she had visited some suspects in jail who complained about the food, medical care and “re-education” they were receiving in custody.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nWhile it’s true some of the suspects have complained about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'Police chief turned yoga instructor insists Ashli Babbitt is not dead before Jan. 6 judge locks him up for more than a decade.

Gordon, Michael R. and Warren P. Strobel. “ U.S.-Funded Scientist Among Three Chinese Researchers Who Fell Ill Amid Early Covid-19 ...', 'Full_text': 'SciCheck Digest\n\nIt remains unknown how the virus that causes COVID-19 originated, but many scientists think a natural spillover is most likely. Online posts have cited unnamed sources to claim that scientists in Wuhan, China, were the first to get sick with COVID-19. But U.S. intelligence says the researchers’ symptoms were non-specific or inconsistent with COVID-19, and the information has no bearing on the origin of the pandemic.\n\nFull Story\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, people have wondered how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, came to be. Did it come from a wild or farmed animal, infected upstream by a bat, as previous pandemics and the early case ties to a wet market would suggest? Or did it come from a lab, particularly the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, which is across the river from the market and does research on coronaviruses?\n\nScientists investigating the origins of COVID-19 have argued in favor of a natural origin, given that the earliest cases, including those with no known connection to the market, geographically cluster around the market — and genetic proof that susceptible animals were illegally sold there. A genomic analysis also indicates there were two early lineages of the virus that spilled over separately — a scenario much harder to reconcile with a lab leak. Without a documented intermediate animal, however, the evidence doesn’t rule out the possibility of a lab origin.\n\nA rumor that one or more WIV workers might have fallen ill with a COVID-like disease in the fall of 2019 has long underpinned claims supporting the lab leak theory. But as we explained previously, the veracity and significance of these alleged reports is unclear, as Wuhan was experiencing a surge of influenza at the time. In October 2021, U.S. Intelligence indicated that such claims had not been confirmed, and in any event, the information was “not diagnostic of the pandemic’s origins.”\n\nBut ahead of the anticipated release of additional declassified material pertaining to the WIV, social media was abuzz with revived claims about the alleged sick workers.\n\nOn June 10, the Times in London published a story mentioning the workers and promoting the baseless claim that the coronavirus is the result of bioweapons research. Laura Ingraham covered it on Fox News, billing the story as a “bombshell,” even though U.S. Intelligence doesn’t give any credence to that idea. A clip of Ingraham’s show, which regularly gets more than 1 million viewers, was viewed on Facebook more than 100,000 times.\n\nThen, on June 13, a Substack post, citing anonymous government sources, claimed to know with “100%” certainty the identity of three “patients zero” who manipulated viruses in the lab. (The Wall Street Journal later published a story saying it had “independently confirmed” the names, but did not offer any evidence other than unnamed sources.) A Facebook post a few days later stated that the “1st person who got sick worked at the Wuhan Lab.”\n\nIn a June 18 interview on Fox News, clips of which were shared on Facebook, Republican Sen. Rand Paul repeated the supposed findings of the Substack post, calling them a “big deal.”\n\n“In the article, they reveal that the first people to get sick from COVID were three scientists, that they worked in the Wuhan lab with the bat scientist Dr. Shi,” he said. “In fact, one of them … the first person to get sick, was one of the ones creating these new viruses, viruses not found in nature. This is the gain-of-function research. And so this essentially closes the deal.”\n\nPaul, who has been a fierce critic of research that might be construed as gain-of function, then suggested the information might be confirmed the next day, when the Director of National Intelligence was expected to release additional declassified information, as ordered by the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023.\n\nBut in its report, which arrived belatedly on June 23, the U.S. Intelligence Community, or IC, does not substantiate any of these details.\n\n“While several WIV researchers fell mildly ill in Fall 2019,” the report reads, “they experienced a range of symptoms consistent with colds or allergies with accompanying symptoms typically not associated with COVID-19, and some of them were confirmed to have been sick with other illnesses unrelated to COVID-19.”\n\nThe 10-page report, which does not name any individuals, says the IC “continues to assess that this information neither supports nor refutes either hypothesis of the pandemic’s origins because the researchers’ symptoms could have been caused by a number of diseases and some of the symptoms were not consistent with COVID-19.”\n\nThe same day of the release, Science reported that two of the accused WIV workers denied being sick in the autumn of 2019, with one of them calling the allegations “ridiculous.” Lab head Shi Zhengli, who has been the target of many of the lab leak scenario claims, further told Science that none of the three accused workers even worked with live viruses, and that antibody testing in March 2020 showed that no one in her lab had evidence of prior infection.\n\nSome scientists have noticed that for the three named scientists, their names do not follow the same ordering convention. While two are written with their family names second, one is written with the family name first, as is standard in China. The individual with the reverse convention was a student who had published a thesis with her name in that order; the thesis had previously become fodder for lab leak proponents online. This suggests, the scientists say, that the names were simply plucked from papers by people who are not familiar with Chinese.\n\nEvolution of the ‘Sick’ Workers Rumor\n\nVarious versions of the “sick” lab workers rumor have been circulating for at least three years.\n\nAs French biologist Flo Débarre detailed in a Twitter thread, the first mention of a sick worker came in April 2020, when John Roberts of Fox News said during a coronavirus briefing that “multiple sources are telling Fox News” that the pandemic began with a WIV intern, who infected her boyfriend and then visited the wet market. (Débarre is a co-author on an unpublished report that analyzed sequences from the wet market, proving that animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 were present at the time.)\n\nThe first official recognition of the rumors was in January 2021, when in the waning days of the Trump administration the State Department put out a “fact sheet” stating that the government “has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.”\n\nSome Republicans and Trump administration officials had been promoting the idea of a lab leak since the spring of 2020, sometimes claiming there was clear evidence of it, but failing to provide any support.\n\nSince then, most iterations of the ‘sick’ worker story, including an influential Wall Street Journal report in May 2021, refer to three WIV workers, although other details have shifted and changed over time. Sometimes it’s specified that all worked on gain-of-function research, or all in the same lab, but other times not. Sometimes they are sick in November 2019; in other versions, it’s October. The illnesses are variously described as respiratory illnesses or consistent with COVID-19, but sometimes include details that could be more diagnostic of COVID-19, such as patients losing their senses of smell and having ground-glass opacities in their lungs. Some versions say the workers were hospitalized or visited a hospital for their symptoms, while others do not. And some add other unsubstantiated details, such as a relative of a worker dying or there being body bags outside of the WIV and the workers having gone missing.\n\nThe provenance of all these claims is unclear, but a couple of former Trump officials consistently pop up as providing information to journalists, including David Asher, a former State Department adviser, and John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence.\n\nAlthough Asher has sometimes referred to foreign sources, neither he nor others have explained exactly what these sources — who may or may not be credible — have said. Nor has any evidence of the rumors been provided.\n\nMultiple aspects of the various tales about the workers, however, are refuted by the latest IC report, and more are left unconfirmed. In addition to the major issue of the symptoms not being specific to COVID-19, the report says there are “no indications” that any sick WIV researchers were hospitalized “because of the symptoms consistent with COVID-19” — and that just one researcher “may have been hospitalized” at the time, but for a non-respiratory condition.\n\nThe report also makes no mention of the workers conducting gain-of-function research. “While some of these researchers had historically conducted research into animal respiratory viruses, we are unable to confirm if any of them handled live viruses in the work they performed prior to falling ill,” the report reads.\n\nClaims declaring that there is proof or even near certainty that WIV scientists started the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, are not only unsupported but also false.\n\nContinued Misinformation\n\nEven after the IC report failed to substantiate the claims about the lab workers, posts on social media were still circulating the misinformation.\n\nTwo YouTube videos, one falsely headlined “Wuhan Lab Leak Theory CONFIRMED” and another referring to “bombshell revelations” and “explosive details on patient zero,” were still getting thousands of views a day on Facebook days after the report’s release.\n\nSome lab leak proponents have also distorted what the IC report said. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served under Trump when the State Department promoted claims about ‘sick’ WIV workers, said in a tweet on June 24 that the IC report “confirms what we knew from the beginning: the only logical explanation is that the virus came from the Wuhan lab.”\n\nThe report confirmed nothing of the sort. It specifically says that it “does not address the merits of the two most likely pandemic origins hypotheses,” and that all agencies still consider a natural and lab origin “plausible.”\n\nThe contents, however, throw cold water on some of the ways that lab leak proponents have suggested a lab leak occurred. In particular, although WIV researchers “probably did not use adequate biosafety precautions at least some of the time,” the report says the IC is not aware of a “specific biosafety incident at the WIV that spurred the pandemic and the WIV’s biosafety training appears routine, rather than an emergency response by China’s leadership.” That contradicts claims made in a disputed ProPublica-Vanity Fair article.\n\nThe report states that there is “no indication that the WIV’s pre-pandemic research holdings included SARS-CoV-2 or a close progenitor, nor any direct evidence that a specific research-related incident occurred involving WIV personnel before the pandemic that could have caused the COVID pandemic.”\n\n“Information available to the IC indicates that the WIV first possessed SARS-CoV-2 in late December 2019,” when researchers were isolating viral samples from patients, the report adds.\n\nFinally, it’s notable that agency opinion is largely against any kind of gain-of-function scenario. “Almost all IC agencies assess that SARS-CoV-2 was not genetically engineered,” the report reads, adding that “[m]ost” agencies also do not think the virus was lab-adapted. All agree the pandemic is not the result of a biological weapon.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system.\n\nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\n\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.”\n\nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions.\n\n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\n\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.”\n\nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic.\n\nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.”\n\nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.”\n\nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection.\n\n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021.\n\nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\n\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\n\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics.\n\n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-02/kariko-weissman-mrna-covid-vaccine-nobel-prize', 'Headline': 'Scientists whose work paved way for COVID vaccines win Nobel - Los ...', 'Snippet': 'Scientists whose work on mRNA paved the way for first COVID-19 vaccines win Nobel Prize.

Physician-scientist Weissman, 64, is a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nTheir work has armed scientists and drug companies with the means to turn the body’s cells into manufacturers of its own medicine.\n\n“This year’s Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic,” said Rickard Sandberg, a member of the Nobel Assembly, noting that mRNA vaccines, together with other COVID-19 shots, “have been administered over 13 billion times.”\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, said both Karikó and Weissman were “overwhelmed” when he notified them of the award, especially Karikó, given her tumultuous professional history.\n\n“Ten years ago, she told me that she was terminated from her current position and had to move to Germany for another position without her family and so forth,” Perlmann said. “So it’s been a dramatic change in her circumstances.”\n\nAlthough mRNA rose to public prominence for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, the technology is expected to become a major basis for flu vaccines, enabling shorter lead times and more accurate matching between circulating influenza strains and yearly shots.\n\nBeyond that, it could play a key role in treating sickle-cell disease and shows promise for the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis. Its potential use in treating cancers is also opening new avenues for arming the immune system against malignancy.\n\nHIV could be the next target. Three new experimental vaccines to protect against HIV infection, all based on an mRNA design similar to that used in the COVID-19 jab, are now undergoing early human clinical trials.\n\nThe techniques pioneered by Karikó and Weissman have enabled scientists to nimbly customize the proteins targeted by vaccines, a key for thwarting shape-shifting viruses such as the coronavirus and HIV.\n\nSuch capabilities more than proved their worth during the pandemic. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were both designed within weeks of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome, and were the first to come off manufacturing lines for worldwide use. Today, the two COVID-19 vaccines are in use in at least 164 countries, and roughly 270 million Americans have received at least one dose.\n\nThat “impressive success story” alone would make recognition of Karikó and Weissman by the Nobel Committee “proper and appropriate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden. But advances the pair made in the use of mRNA have only begun to be felt in medicine, he added.\n\nKarikó was first introduced to ribonucleic acid, or RNA, in 1978 and said she’s been “passionate about this fragile molecule ever since.” She was exploring DNA’s use of messenger RNA to deliver specific work orders to cells when she met Weissman over a photocopy machine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1997.\n\nAntiretroviral medications were just entering wide use against HIV/AIDS at the time, and Weissman was trying to design a vaccine against a disease that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. He had been intrigued by the possibility that mRNA could induce cells to produce proteins that the body was missing or that it needed to heal itself. But he knew that efforts to repurpose this delicate nucleic acid for medical purposes had hit a host of stumbling blocks.\n\nKarikó was intimately familiar with the obstacles to mRNA’s use. And she was well aware of the skepticism directed its way by the scientific community. After earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Hungary’s University of Szeged and immigrating to the United States in 1985, she had been determined to find ways to harness mRNA for treatments.\n\nBy the time she met Weissman, Karikó had been an itinerant postdoctoral researcher for more than a decade. At Temple University in Philadelphia, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., and the University of Pennsylvania, she had tried to drum up support for work on mRNA’s biomedical uses. She had a drawer full of rejected grant proposals to show for it.\n\nWeissman’s research pedigree was more promising. A biochemistry major at Brandeis University, Weissman earned his medical degree and a doctorate at Boston University and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. While there, he studied a key node of the mammalian immune system — dendritic cells — and their perturbation in HIV/AIDS.\n\nWeissman knew that messenger RNA had an incidental effect on dendritic cells: Their interaction touched off an immune response that ignited dangerous inflammation across the body.\n\nWeissman and Karikó both realized that until that problem could be fixed, mRNA would be of limited biomedical use, and no use at all in making vaccines. There was also the problem of mRNA’s fragility outside of cells: Unpackaged, it was easily chewed up by enzymes, and getting it through cells’ outer walls was no picnic either.\n\nThe two scientists formed a partnership of grit and grace. Over more than two decades, Karikó’s and Weissman’s experiments shed more light on how mRNA could be repurposed to enter cells and safely order up the production of certain proteins. They watched how other nucleic acids snuck past the immune system unnoticed and devised a fix that enabled mRNA to ferry new work orders into cells without causing flares of inflammation.\n\n“Each spark of something interesting, whether a finding we expected — or even more exciting, the ones we didn’t — motivated us to continue,” Weissman said in a speech accepting the 2021 Lasker Award, one of several prestigious scientific honors the pair have won in recent years.\n\n“Together we designed and conducted experiments, often trading emails into the early hours — unable to wait until the next day to share particular findings or ideas,” Weissman said. “We just kept at it.”\n\nBy 2004, the two had produced a paper that detailed their success at reengineering mRNA for use in mammals. In an interview with the journal Cell, the two recalled that their first paper together was rejected by the three premier science journals — Cell, Science and Nature. One reviewer dismissed the work as a mere “incremental improvement” over existing research in the area.\n\nKarikó said she had to look up “incremental” in the dictionary. Undeterred, the pair got their paper published in a specialty journal, Immunity, in 2005. Then they waited for the conference invitations to pour in.\n\n“We sat and stared at the phone, and nothing happened,” Weissman said. After presenting the paper at one conference, Karikó said a fellow scientist came up and asked who had supervised her work — the kind of question no one would ask a man of her age.\n\nNot until 2010, after the pair published findings that further improved the prospects for mRNA’s use, did the medical establishment start to take notice. By 2012, Weismann and Karikó led a team that showed that mRNA, introduced into mice, could prompt the temporary production of red blood cells.\n\n“They had to do some really fancy manipulation to allow it to persist long enough” inside the body to ferry genetic instructions into cells, Fauci said. “They were persistent, resilient, and they stuck to it,” he added. “It’s a great example of the scientific process.”\n\nIn 2013, Karikó left the University of Pennsylvania to join BioNTech, reasoning that pharmaceutical companies would eclipse universities in devising treatments using mRNA technology.\n\nWhen the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China in 2019, BioNTech had already used mRNA technology to design a vaccine against the Zika virus, which had infected hundreds of thousands of pregnant women and caused grievous birth defects across the world. Moderna, too, had been working on a Zika vaccine, as well as vaccines against cytomegalovirus infection and cancers.\n\nWithin two weeks of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic sequence, both companies had what they needed to build a vaccine. They used different formulations for the delivery of mRNA, but once inside a human cell, the vaccines provided the genetic specifications for producing harmless replicas of the coronavirus’ spike proteins. The human immune system would take it from there.\n\nWhen health officials in the U.S. and United Kingdom ordered up a new crop of COVID-19 booster shots that targeted the Omicron variant, all Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna had to do was insert a key piece of genetic code that matched the desired strains. The updated shots were ready in mere months.\n\nWeissman has established laboratories in Thailand, South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries to devise COVID-19 vaccines that can be produced locally. His research continues to explore ways for mRNA vaccines to provide more enduring protection against COVID-19 by training the immune system to recognize pieces of the virus that are much less prone to mutation.\n\nIn addition, Weissman has joined with other scientists to counter the misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 shots that has made many people unwilling to roll up their sleeves.\n\n“As important as the vaccine is, if you don’t take it, it doesn’t work,” he said in an interview Monday with nobelprize.org, adding that the endorsement from the Nobel committee might help sway some of those who have been hesitant.\n\nHe remains at the University of Pennsylvania, and is married to Mary Ellen Weissman. They have two daughters, Rachel and Allison.\n\nKarikó left BioNTech in 2022 but is still a consultant for the company. She is now a research professor at the University of Szeged and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKarikó is married to Béla Francia, who she said encouraged her decision to commute to BioNTech in Germany when she lost her position at Penn. The couple and their daughter, Zsuzsanna “Susan” Francia, arrived in the United States in 1985 with their life savings — about $1,000 — sewn into the stuffing of a teddy bear. (Susan Francia grew up to become a decorated rower, winning two Olympic gold medals for the United States.)\n\n“I try to tell fellow female scientists that you don’t have to choose between having a family, you can have it,” she told nobelprize.org on Monday. “Your child will watch you and they will do, because that’s what counts, the example that you present.”\n\nThrough it all, Karikó has said she was not deterred by her lack of funding, the lack of interest from the medical establishment or the slow pace at which she and Weissman uncovered mRNA’s secrets.\n\n“I am so glad it helped humanity,” Karikó told a University of Pennsylvania interviewer. But for decades, the process of scientific discovery was its own reward, she added.\n\n“So many enigmatic things about RNA I find very, very exciting,” Karikó said. She and Weissman would ask questions and then design experiments to answer them.\n\n“And of course, instead of the answer, we got 100 more questions,” she added. “It was very enjoyable. I would like to emphasize that to be a scientist is a joy.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.science.org/content/article/mrna-discovery-paved-way-covid-19-vaccines-wins-nobel-prize-physiology-medicine', 'Headline': 'mRNA discovery that paved way for COVID-19 vaccines wins ... - Science', 'Snippet': 'The seed for the mRNA vaccine idea was planted in the 1980s, following the development of techniques to generate the genetic strands in the lab. ...

The paper then calculates a weighted average, giving more weight to studies that said their findings were more precise. Nearly all of the weight — 91.8% — goes to one study, even though the working paper rejects the conclusions of that study.\n\nThat study — coauthored by Carolyn Chisadza, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Pretoria, and published on March 10, 2021, in the journal Sustainability — looked at a sample of countries between March and September 2020 and concluded: “Less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.”\n\nThe working paper claims the researchers’ conclusion is incorrect — but it uses the study’s estimates, saying the figures show an increase in mortality due to “lockdowns.”\n\nChisadza told us in an email that the study showed: “Stricter lockdowns will reduce the rate of deaths than would have occurred without lockdown or too lenient of restrictions.” But Hanke said the data from Chisadza and her colleagues only show that “stricter lockdowns will reduce mortality” relative to “the worst possible lockdown,” meaning a more lenient lockdown that, under the study, was associated with the highest rate of deaths.\n\nWe reached out to a third party about this disagreement.

They found the Chisadza study only measured the correlation between current death growth rates and current policies. It did not show the lagged effect of more stringent policies, implemented three weeks prior, on current death growth rates, which is what one would want to look at to evaluate the effectiveness of “lockdowns.”\n\nIn an email and in a phone interview, Chernozhukov told us the Chisadza study made an “honest mistake.” He said the working paper is “deeply flawed” partly because it relies heavily on a study that “estimates the wrong effect very precisely.”\n\nIn their review, Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf write that the Chisadza et al. study “should be interpreted as saying that the countries currently experiencing high death rates (or death growth rates) are more likely to implement more stringent current policy. That is the only conclusion we can draw from [the study], because the current policy can not possibly influence the current deaths,” given the several weeks of delay between new infections and deaths.\n\nThe effect that should be examined for the meta-analysis is “the effect of the previous (e.g., 3 week lagged) policy stringency index on the current death growth rates.”\n\nChernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf conducted a “quick reanalysis of similar data” to the Chisadza study, finding results that “suggest that more stringent policies in the past predict lower death growth rates.” Chernozhukov said much more analysis would be needed to further characterize this effect, but that it is “actually quite substantial.”\n\nIf the Chisadza study were removed from the working paper, according to one of the paper’s footnotes, the result would be a weighted average reduction in mortality of 3.5%, which Hanke said doesn’t change the “overall conclusions.” He said it “simply demonstrates the obvious fact that the conclusions contained in our meta-analysis are robust.”\n\nBut experts have pointed out other issues with the meta-analysis. Chernozhukov also said the paper “excluded a whole bunch of studies,” including synthetic control method studies, which evaluate treatment effects. He also questioned the utility of looking at a policy index that considers the U.S. as a whole, lumping all the states together. He said the meta-analysis is “not credible at all.”\n\nAmong the other six stringency index studies included in the meta-analysis, only one concluded that its findings suggested “lockdowns” had zero effect on mortality. In a review of 24 European countries’ weekly mortality rates for the first six months of 2017-2020, the study, published in CESifo Economic Studies, found “no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.” The author and Herby, one of the authors of the working paper, have written for the American Institute for Economic Research, which facilitated the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 statement advocating those at low risk of dying from COVID-19 “live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection,” while those at “highest risk” are protected.\n\nThe other studies found lockdown policies helped COVID-19 health outcomes. For instance, a CDC study published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in January 2021, on the experience of 37 European countries from Jan. 23 to June 30, 2020, concluded that “countries that implemented more stringent mitigation policies earlier in their outbreak response tended to report fewer COVID-19 deaths through the end of June 2020. These countries might have saved several thousand lives relative to countries that implemented similar policies, but later.”\n\nA working paper from Harvard University’s Center for International Development, which looked at 152 countries from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 31, 2020, found that “lockdowns tend to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and the number of related deaths.” But the effect fades over time, so lengthy (after four months) or second-phase “lockdowns” don’t have the same impact.\n\nA study published in World Medical & Health Policy in November 2020 — that looked at whether 24 European countries responded quickly enough — found that the fluctuating containment measures, from country to country and over time, “prohibited a clear association with the mortality rate.” But it said “the implementation speed of these containment measures in response to the coronavirus had a strong effect on the successful mitigation of fatalities.”\n\nMany studies found restrictions worked. Meyerowitz-Katz noted that the working paper authors disagreed with the conclusions of other studies included in the review, pointing to one included in the group of shelter-in-place orders. Meyerowitz-Katz said that study “found that significant restrictions were effective, but is included in this review as estimating a 13.1% INCREASE in fatalities.”\n\nThat study, by Yale School of Management researchers, published by The Review of Financial Studies in June 2021, developed “a time-series database” on several types of restrictions for every U.S. county from March to December 2020. The authors concluded: “We find strong evidence consistent with the idea that employee mask policies, mask mandates for the general population, restaurant and bar closures, gym closures, and high-risk business closures reduce future fatality growth. Other business restrictions, such as second-round closures of low- to medium-risk businesses and personal care/spa services, did not generate consistent evidence of lowered fatality growth and may have been counterproductive.” The authors said the study’s “findings lie somewhere in the middle of the existing results on how NPIs influenced the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nIn terms of hard figures on fatality reductions, the study said the estimates suggest a county with a mandatory mask policy would see 15.3% fewer new deaths per 10,000 residents on average six weeks later, compared with a county without a mandatory mask policy. The impact for restaurant closures would be a decrease of 36.4%. But the estimates suggest other measures, including limits on gatherings of 100 people or more, appeared to increase deaths. The authors said one possible explanation of such effects could be that the public is substituting other activities that actually increase transmission of the virus — such as hosting weddings with 99 people in attendance, just under the 100-person limitation.\n\nAnother study in the shelter-in-place group is the study by Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf, published in the Journal of Econometrics in January 2021. It looked at the policies in U.S. states and found that “nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic … could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.” It found cases would have been 6% to 63% higher without stay-at-home orders and found “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of closing schools. It also found “substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.”\n\nThe working paper considered 13 studies that evaluated stay-in-place orders, either alone or in combination with other NPIs. The estimated effect on total fatalities for each study calculated by the authors varied quite widely, from a decrease of 40.8% to an increase of 13.1% (the study above mentioned by Meyerowitz-Katz). The authors then combined the studies into a weighted average showing a 2.9% decrease in mortality from these studies on shelter-in-place orders.\n\nSizable impact from some NPIs. The working paper actually found a sizable decrease in deaths related to closing nonessential businesses: a 10.6% weighted average reduction in mortality. The authors said this “is likely to be related to the closure of bars.” It also calculated a 21.2% weighted average reduction in deaths due to mask requirements, but notes “this conclusion is based on only two studies.”\n\nAs with the shelter-in-place group, the calculated effects in the specific NPIs group varied widely – from a 50% reduction in mortality due to business closures to a 36% increase due to border closures. The paper said “differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results.”\n\n“The review itself does refer to other papers that reported that the lockdowns had a significant impact in preventing deaths,” Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us when we asked for his thoughts on the working paper. “The pandemic has now been occurring long enough that it’s not surprising to begin to see many more reports that now contradict each other. As we all know, the US and Europe went through several periods when they relaxed their lockdowns, which was followed by a resurgence of the cases.”\n\nRiley said that “many of the studies that this review included may suffer from the classic ‘chicken-or-egg’ bias. Whenever there was an increase in cases of deaths, lockdowns got instituted so it’s not surprising that some of the studies showed no impact of the lockdowns. If there was no surge of cases or deaths, most places in the US did not impose restrictions.”\n\nMeyerowitz-Katz noted on Twitter that “the impact of ‘lockdowns’ is very hard to assess, if for no other reason than we have no good definition of ‘lockdown’ in the first place. … In most cases, it seems the authors have taken estimates for stay-at-home orders as their practical definition of ‘lockdown’ (this is pretty common) And honestly, I’d agree that the evidence for marginal benefit from stay-at-home orders once you’ve already implemented dozens of restrictions is probably quite weak.”\n\nBut, “if we consider ‘lockdown’ to be any compulsory restriction at all, the reality is that virtually all research shows a (short-term) mortality benefit from at least some restrictions.”\n\nAdditional Studies\n\nWe’ve already mentioned two studies beyond those in the working paper: the Nature June 2020 study by Imperial College London researchers that estimated interventions in 11 countries in Europe in the first few months of the pandemic reduced transmission and averted 3.1 million deaths; and the Nature May 2020 study that estimated cases in mainland China would have been 67-fold greater without several NPIs by the end of February.\n\nThere are many more that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, not included in the working paper’s analysis.\n\nA 2020 unpublished observational study — cited in the working paper as the basis for the Oxford stringency index but not included in the analysis — found that more stringent restrictions implemented more quickly led to fewer deaths. “A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.” In considering nine NPIs, the authors said the average daily growth rates in deaths were affected by each additional stringency index point and each day that a country delayed reaching an index of 40 on the stringency scale. “These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to [a stringency index of 40] would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall,” they wrote.\n\nA more up-to-date study by many of the same authors, posted July 9, 2021, by the journal Plos One, looked at data for 186 countries from Jan. 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, a period over which 10 countries experienced three waves of the pandemic. In the first wave in those countries, 10 additional points on the stringency index — in other words more stringent restrictions — “resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points” and by 28 percentage points in the third wave. “Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries,” the authors said.\n\nA Dec. 15, 2020, study in Science used data from 41 countries to model which NPIs were most effective at reducing transmission. “Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing high-exposure businesses, and closing schools and universities were each more effective than stay-at-home orders, which were of modest effect in slowing transmission,” the authors said. “When these interventions were already in place, issuing a stay-at-home order had only a small additional effect. These results indicate that, by using effective interventions, some countries could control the epidemic while avoiding stay-at-home orders.” The study, like many others, looked at the impact on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, or the average number of people each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time. It notes that a reduction in this number would affect COVID-19 mortality, and that the impact of NPIs can depend on other factors, including when and for how long they are implemented, and how much the public adhered to them.\n\nA study in Nature Human Behaviour on Nov. 16, 2020, considered the impact on the reproduction number of COVID-19 by 6,068 NPIs in 79 territories, finding that a combination of less intrusive measures could be as effective as a national lockdown. “The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns and closing and restricting places where people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, mandatory home working and so on) and closure of educational institutions.” The authors said this doesn’t mean an early national lockdown isn’t effective in reducing transmission but that “a suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures can substitute for a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness, while reducing adverse impacts on society, the economy, the humanitarian response system and the environment.” They found that “risk-communication strategies” were highly effective, meaning government education and communication efforts that would encourage voluntary behavior. “Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally less effective than imposing distancing measures by law.”\n\nAnother study in Nature in June 2020 looked at 1,700 NPIs in six countries, including the United States. “We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections,” the authors concluded. “Without these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May” in 2020, Solomon Hsiang, the lead researcher and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, told reporters. The study didn’t estimate how many lives were saved, but Hsiang said the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”\n\nA more recently published study in Nature Communications in October, by U.K. and European researchers, found that closures of businesses and educational institutions, as well as gathering bans, reduced transmission during the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe — but by less than in the first wave. “This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them,” the authors said. The 17 NPIs considered by the study led to median reductions in the reproduction number of 77% to 82% in the first wave and 66% in the second wave.\n\nA February 2021 study in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science estimated large reductions in infections (by 72%) and deaths (by 76%) in New York City in 2020, based on numerical experiments in a model. “Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases,” the authors said.\n\nNear the end of his lengthy Twitter thread on the working paper, Meyerowitz-Katz said he agrees that “a lot of people originally underestimated the impact of voluntary behaviour change on COVID-19 death rates – it’s probably not wrong to argue that lockdowns weren’t as effective as we initially thought.” He pointed to the Nature Communications study mentioned above, showing less of an impact from NPIs in a second wave of COVID-19 and positing individual safety behaviors were playing more of a role in that second wave.\n\n“HOWEVER, this runs both ways,” Meyerowitz-Katz said. “[I]t is also quite likely that lockdowns did not have the NEGATIVE impact most people propose, because some behaviour changes were voluntary!”\n\nHe and others examined whether lockdowns were more harmful than the pandemic itself in a 2021 commentary piece in BMJ Global Health. They concluded that “government interventions, even more restrictive ones such as stay-at-home orders, are beneficial in some circumstances and unlikely to be causing harms more extreme than the pandemic itself.” Analyzing excess mortality suggested that “lockdowns are not associated with large numbers of deaths in places that avoided large COVID-19 epidemics,” such as Australia and New Zealand, they wrote.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data.

Former President Donald Trump waits to take the witness stand at New York Supreme Court on Monday, Nov. 6, 2023. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AP', 'Full_text': 'Testifying under oath in a New York courtroom with the fate of his family\'s business empire on the line, former President Donald Trump lashed out against the judicial forces that put him there.\n\nTrump has already been found liable for fraud, a word he lobbed at the judge overseeing the civil trial against him. He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-civil-fraud-trial-11-06-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testifies in New York civil fraud trial | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': ""From CNN's Dan Berman. Former President Donald Trump returns to the courtroom after a break in proceedings at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP ..."", 'Full_text': 'Key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand\n\nDonald Trump brought bombastic rhetoric to the witness stand Monday in the civil fraud case against him and his business, as he spent his time on the stand attacking the New York attorney general who brought the case and the judge overseeing the trial itself.\n\nTrump’s testimony at times mimicked his appearances on the campaign trail, where the former president has made the four criminal cases against him – along with the New York attorney general’s civil fraud case – a central part of his argument to be elected president again in 2024.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, who has clashed with Trump throughout the trial, at first tried to stop the former president’s political barbs and speechifying, telling his lawyer Chris Kise to “control your client” and threatening to have Trump removed as a witness. Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump heads to the witness stand as the latest polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states\n\nA year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.\n\nBut it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.\n\nIn another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.\n\n“I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThe coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.\n\nBiden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.\n\nKeep reading here.\n\nHas a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won’t be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.\n\nRoosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.\n\nThose Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt’s final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders – the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York – hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-witness-list-250-million-civil-fraud-trial-starting-week-rcna117958', 'Headline': 'Trump is on the witness list for $250 million civil fraud trial ...', 'Snippet': ""Former President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in New York on Sept. 6.

Biden told the crowd that he was shortening his speech. “Get out of the rain!” he advised.\n\nBiden spoke about topics like healthcare, the pandemic, and taxes. Supporters honked in their cars to show support.\n\nBiden’s rally enforced social distancing, shared Angie Angers of Bay News 9.

The temperature was 87 degrees and so hot that a fire truck sprayed water on the crowd near the back to help them stay cool, TMZ reported.\n\nSome people passed out because the rally got so hot, shared Monica Alba of NBC News. She said medics were being called every five to 10 minutes because of the heat. NBC News later reported that 17 people needed medical attention and about a dozen had to go to the hospital.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump was at the rally and introduced Trump.\n\nThousands attended Trump’s rally, Alba shared, and although they were given masks, some told her that they didn’t feel the need to wear them.\n\nThe crowd was packed shoulder-to-shoulder for the rally.\n\nThis video also shows the crowd.\n\nZac Anderson of the Herald Tribune said the campaign told him that 15,000 tickets were requested.

A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday ...', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/read-full-jan-6-committee-report-detailing-investigation-capitol-attac-rcna63065', 'Headline': 'Read the full Jan. 6 committee report detailing its investigation into ...', 'Snippet': ""Dec. 23, 2022, 4:47 AM UTC.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene allege the cities and several advocacy groups conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.', 'Full_text': 'Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues “on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.”\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has “not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.”\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or “coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies” and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pressreader.com/usa/daily-news-los-angeles/20230715/282638922057805', 'Headline': 'GOP reps sue Riverside and Anaheim - PressReader', 'Snippet': 'Gaetz and Greene also tried holding their rally in Anaheim.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/nancy-pelosi-january-6th-camera-crew-action/', 'Headline': 'Documentary footage of Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t ... - Poynter', 'Snippet': 'A fraud.

A villain.\n\nIn his June 3 Facebook post, that’s how conservative activist Benny Johnson described Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her role on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day a crowd of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNewly released Jan. 6, 2021, footage shows the then-House speaker, her staff and security detail walking through the corridors of the Capitol. Johnson claimed that footage proved Pelosi had a nefarious role in the incident.\n\n“She had a camera crew follow her around on January 6th,” he wrote. “New tapes show her waiting to stage her escape until the camera man (her daughter) said, ‘Action!’ It was all a movie. It was a script. It was all planned.”\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nJohnson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the new footage he appears to have referred to was posted on Just The News, a conservative website founded by John Solomon, a journalist and opinion writer whose past work has furthered unproven narratives.\n\nThe video, which Solomon described as Capitol Police security footage that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy “made available” to Just The News, has no sound. It shows Pelosi walking through the corridors alongside members of her staff and security personnel. In the video, a woman who remains just steps away from Pelosi appears to be recording with a hand-held camera. Just The News identified that woman as Pelosi’s daughter Alexandra Pelosi.\n\nIt has been publicly reported by multiple news organizations that Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, filmed her mother during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. This isn’t unusual. Fox News reported that she has filmed her mother at the Capitol for decades.\n\nIn October 2022, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact there wasn’t a camera crew that day — just Alexandra Pelosi with a small, hand-held camera that she always carries.\n\nThe security camera footage posted by Just The News supports Hammill’s assertion.\n\nThe clips do not prove that the events on Jan. 6, 2021, were part of a scripted plan. During years of reporting on the attack, PolitiFact has found no credible evidence that the attack was contrived.\n\nFueled partly by the false belief that the presidential election had been stolen, hundreds of people — many clad in Trump-branded apparel, others in helmets and combat gear, some armed with weapons — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nRioters scaled walls, broke windows, forced their way into the building and repeatedly clashed with police. One woman was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the attack. The siege forced lawmakers to evacuate and temporarily delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nSince the attack, more than 1,000 people have faced federal charges for crimes ranging from obstruction of Congress to using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Of those, more than 580 people have pleaded guilty and 514 have been sentenced, according to an NPR analysis.\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Capitol’s top operations and maintenance official told lawmakers that the costs of the riot — including repairs, increased security and the provision of mental health services — would exceed $30 million.\n\nFalsehoods about the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including claims that it was a false flag, were named PolitiFact’s 2021 Lie of the Year. In the years since, we’ve continued fact-checking false claims about the attack; it was a real event with real consequences.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claimed “new tapes” of Nancy Pelosi show Jan. 6 “was all planned.”\n\nNewly released security camera footage captured on Jan. 6, 2021, shows Nancy Pelosi being filmed by her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, during the Capitol attack. The footage does not prove the attack was scripted or planned, and we found no credible evidence to support that claim.\n\nThe attack was real; it caused millions of dollars in damage and prompted hundreds of arrests.\n\nWe rate these claims False.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/nov/21/instagram-posts/footage-of-nancy-pelosi-on-jan-6-2021-doesnt-prove/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Footage of Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn’t prove ...', 'Snippet': 'Following news that House Speaker Mike Johnson would release 44,000 hours of footage from Jan. 6, 2021, social media users are claiming pre-existing videos of Rep.

It comes after 15 Senate Republicans broke ranks and voted for the bill late Thursday night.\n\nThe bipartisan measure, negotiated by Democratic and Republican senators with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\'s blessing, includes multimillion dollar investments in mental health services and school security, as well as a new federal ban on gun trafficking.\n\nThe gun safety bill would also offer new funding to support states and tribes that seek to enact ""red flag"" laws — which allow authorities to confiscate guns from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others — closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole,"" and subjecting gun purchasers under the age of 21 to new background check requirements.\n\nThe National Rifle Association announced their opposition to the bill within an hour of the text\'s release, and House Republicans cited the group\'s opposition as it urged their members to vote against the bill when it comes to the House.

Most of those — 24,292 — were suicides, while 19,384 deaths were homicides.\n\nThe death rates per 100,000 population were 13.7 for all firearm deaths, 7.4 for suicides and 5.9 for homicides. The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nraila.org/articles/20230315/bidens-executive-order-targeting-gun-ownership', 'Headline': 'Biden’s Executive Order Targeting Gun Ownership - NRA-ILA', 'Snippet': 'Wednesday, March 15, 2023.

Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.', 'Full_text': 'Biden Administration Delivers on the President’s State of the Union Promise with Proposed Federal Minimum Staffing Requirements, Tougher Enforcement Initiatives, and Efforts to Expand Nursing Workforce\n\nThe nursing home industry receives nearly $100 billion annually from American taxpayers, yet too many nursing homes chronically understaff their facilities—resulting in poor, substandard care that endangers residents. When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': 'On Sept. 1, the Biden administration issued a proposal to establish comprehensive staffing requirements for nursing homes across the country.', 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives.""

However, what is making waves is a whistleblower named Brook Jackson. She claims that in September 2020, when she was hired to oversee the testing of a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer, criminal fraud occurred, allowing the vaccine to be FDA-approved.\n\nThe questions which have been asked the most since these allegations became public are:\n\nWhat criminal fraud was committed?\n\nIs there anything mentioned in the lawsuit that could be deemed criminal fraud?\n\nAre there holes in Ms. Jackson's claims?\n\nWhile there are issues with mishandling biohazard materials during the testing process, is that enough to constitute a data integrity breach?\n\nYou might find the issues brought up by Professor Dorit Rubenstein Reiss of the University of California Hastings College of Law quite interesting. Do you think that Reiss has created massive holes in the claims stated by Ms. Jackson? As far as we can tell, Jackson or her legal team has not addressed these holes. You can read them here.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that just because Jackson or her legal team has not addressed the holes does not mean they are legit.\n\nOthers have wondered why Ms. Jackson went to BMJ.com to break the story, a UK company instead of one in the US. Was no media outlet willing to break the story because they felt it lacked objective evidence?\n\nHow much does it pay to sue Big Pharma? A lot. If the government intervenes, the relator (the official designation of the whistleblower) can expect 15-25% of the amount the government recovers. The highest recorded payout to a whistleblower is $32 million. And if the government agrees with Jackson, her payout could be substantially more.\n\nThe Key Players\n\nPfizer Inc. - is the manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine as safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 for individuals 12 or older. The vaccine is currently marketed under the name Comirnaty. The FDA ruled no problem with the data submitted, and no criminal fraud was committed.\n\nVentavia Research Group (VRG) - The independent lab tested the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. According to their website, they have eight locations in Texas: Houston, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, Keller, Burleson, Weatherford, and Grapevine. They have just under 100 employees and have performed clinical trial research since 2013.\n\nThe FDA has not taken any action against Ventavia and fully accepted the data from the vaccine testing performed at Ventavia facilities. Wouldn't it make sense if there was an actual problem that the FDA would have taken action? But they didn't.\n\nBrook Jackson - Known as The COVID-19 Pfizer Whistleblower who reported her findings to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Jackson states she has audio recordings and copies of company documents backing up her claims about how VRG conducted the vaccine trial.\n\nOne photo allegedly shows needles used in the vaccine trial had been discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of the approved sharps container box. It is unclear if the used needles were poking through the plastic bag creating a potential injury to anyone handling the bag or near it. Another photo shows the potential of unblinding the participants as the completed vaccine packing materials contained the trial participants' identification numbers, which were out in the open instead of in a secured location.\n\nDoes this sound like criminal fraud to you? Does it paint a picture of a lack of training? Yes. How about that when overworked employees often make mistakes they wouldn't under normal circumstances? That would be probable.\n\nPaul Thacker - the reporter responsible for breaking the story, is described as an American journalist who has reported on science, medicine, and the environment.

gnews.org/1414267/,Zero COVID nations new records,"{1: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39638-4', 'Headline': 'Swift and extensive Omicron outbreak in China after sudden exit from ...', 'Snippet': 'From the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic until fall 2022, China maintained a strict ‘zero-COVID’ set of policies that implemented strong non-pharmaceutical interventions such as city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, contact tracing of direct and secondary contacts, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals and their contacts in centralized facilities.', 'Full_text': 'Understanding the official case count data during the different phases of public health policy\n\nWe first aimed to understand the spread of the Omicron variant in China immediately before the relaxation of zero-COVID (i.e., between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, 2022). Under zero-COVID, testing was mandatory and frequent, leading the official case count data to be a reliable portrayal of the levels of COVID-19 infection in China. Despite the strict measures, such as frequent city-wide lock-downs, travel and movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantine of infected individuals, the data show a clear exponential increase in COVID-19 cases (caused by the extremely transmissible Omicron variants) shortly before the relaxation of zero-COVID (Fig. 1a). Using a negative binomial regression, we estimated the rate of this exponential growth to be 0.14/day (95% CI: [0.13, 0.15]/day) during this period.\n\nOfficial data after Nov. 11 (when zero-COVID was replaced by 20 Measures and subsequently 10 Measures) report that growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic slowed (Fig. 1a), and eventually the official daily reported cases declined after Nov. 27. This pattern is unexpected. Presumably, the relaxation of strict interventions under zero-COVID would lead to more rapid spread, contrary to what is observed from the official case count data. We reason that the only plausible explanation is the cessation of the requirement for mass testing and rigorous reporting, which led to a rapid decoupling of the surveillance data from the epidemic intensity. As a result, the official case count data after Nov. 11 reflect the rapidly declining detection rate rather than real change in the infection dynamics.\n\nEstimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Nov. and Dec. 2022\n\nTo compensate for the under-reported official case count data after Nov. 11, we collected results from a large online survey conducted on Dec. 26, 2022 by a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security13. The survey reported the fraction of individuals in three categories: those who thought they had never been infected, thought they currently had COVID-19 symptoms, or thought they had been but were no longer symptomatic (see “Methods” for details). Note that these survey categories do not directly correspond to the epidemiological states of susceptible, infected, and recovered, because each person is reporting based on symptoms and does not know their true infectiousness status. In particular, individuals may become infectious before their symptoms begin, and their symptoms may linger even after they are no longer infectious. When interpreted correctly, however, these data should provide insight into the epidemic stage and thus allow inference of the epidemic dynamics.\n\nWe developed an expanded susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that mapped reporting based on symptoms to true infection status. The states of the model are explained in Fig. 2, and equations and further details are provided in “Methods”. We separated the model into three time periods to allow changes in official policy to affect the transmission rate (Fig. 1a). Official case counts were reliable for the first period, up to Nov. 11, due to mandatory and frequent testing. There is no clear observation for the second period, so we simply assumed the transmission rate must be no less than in the first period. The dynamics of the third period were then mainly determined by the population survey data on Dec. 26.\n\nOur model assumes no pre-existing population immunity against Omicron. We calculated the levels of vaccine-induced population immunity against Omicron infection based on published vaccination data14 and the decay of vaccine effectiveness against infection15 (see “Methods” and Fig. S2). We found that the population immunity before the Dec. 2022 wave of Omicron was below 0.1%, and thus would have negligible effect on the model inference.\n\nFitting the model to the case count and survey data, we estimated that the outbreak in China grew exponentially at a rate of 0.15/day (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.13, 0.15]/day) under zero-COVID between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11, increased slightly to 0.17 [0.14, 0.17]/day under 20 Measures, and increased dramatically to 0.42 [0.35, 0.44]/day immediately after full exit from zero-COVID (Fig. 1c), with the epidemic then peaking around Dec. 23 (Fig. 1d). This translates to an epidemic doubling time of 4.7 [4.5, 5.4] days, 4.2 [4.0, 5.0] days, and 1.6 [1.6, 2.0] days for the three periods, respectively.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days for Omicron16 (see “Methods”), we calculated the reproductive number, Rexp, during the exponential increase stage of the three periods. It increased from 1.57 [1.49, 1.59] during the end of zero-COVID to 3.13 [2.66, 3.27] at the start of the full exit from zero-COVID (Table S1, Fig. 1c). Based on these values, we estimated that the zero-COVID policy prior to relaxation suppressed the transmission of these Omicron variants by 56% [46%, 64%].\n\nOur results suggest that on Dec. 7, the day when full exit from zero-COVID was announced, there were ~1 million new infections. Because of the extremely high rate of spread afterwards, the outbreak ballooned such that 97% [95%, 99%] of the population (i.e., 1.37 billion people) became infected in December. As a result of the exponential nature of the spread, the vast majority of people (88% [83%, 93%] of the population) became infected during the short window of time between Dec. 15 and 31, 2022 (Fig. 1d).\n\nRobustness to model and data assumptions\n\nWe tested the robustness of our findings—particularly, that nearly the entire population became infected in Dec. 2022—to many properties of the data and model.\n\nFirst, we previously assumed that the numbers of confirmed cases from Oct. 28 to Nov. 11 represented the actual number of infected individuals, i.e., that the case reporting rate in China was 100%. This is a reasonable approximation because of the mandatory mass testing in place: all individuals were required to get tested every 2–5 days. However, it is possible that some infected individuals were not detected. We therefore considered an alternative in which the reporting rate was only 50%. Here, the estimated growth rate after Dec. 7 was reduced slightly to 0.40/day, the size of the susceptible population by the end of Dec. remained below 4%, and the epidemic again peaked on Dec. 23 (Fig. S3).\n\nSecond, we previously assumed the Dec. 26 survey results were an unbiased random sample of the entire population. If, however, recovered people were more likely to respond to the survey, or people reported symptoms not due to COVID-19 (e.g., instead due to influenza—an unlikely scenario given the recent report by China CDC5), the numbers of symptomatic or recovered individuals would be over-reported and our growth rate estimate would be too high. We therefore made a large perturbation of the Dec. 26 data by moving 20% of people from each of the symptomatic and recovered categories into the uninfected category. The estimated growth rate was then reduced slightly to 0.39/day after Dec. 7, the size of the susceptible population by Dec. 31 remained below 4%, and the epidemic peak moved slightly to Dec. 24 (Fig. S4).\n\nThird, in our inference of the transmission rates, we fixed many parameter values from the literature. We tested the sensitivity of our results to those assumed values by re-fitting the model using different values. In one strategy, we set the value of each state transition parameter (kE, kIP, kIS, kS, kA, and kT; all defined in Fig. 2, Table S3, Eq. 1) to either 25% higher or lower than our baseline value (Fig. S5). In another strategy, we assigned an appropriate amount of uncertainty to the incubation period, pre-symptomatic period, symptomatic period, generation interval, and time to PCR testing, drew values from each distribution, and derived the state transition parameters (details in Table S3); this was repeated 25 times. In all cases, the median exponential growth rate remained above 0.25/day after Dec. 7, the median size of the population still susceptible by Dec. 31 remained <6% and the 95% CrI remained <10%, and the epidemic peak remained between Dec. 21–25.\n\nFourth, we previously assumed that the entire population is well-mixed. If, however, population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection, such as people who live in urban areas or younger age groups) were also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. To test the impact of population structure on our conclusions, we extended our model to build a meta-population model with two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates. We assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. We considered various scenarios with different assumptions about the contact rates between the two subpopulations and the contact rate in the unsampled population (see Fig. S6 and “Methods”). In general, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and that >90% of the entire population was infected by the end of Dec. (Fig. S7), consistent with our main findings. This suggests that for a virus that transmits extremely efficiently and rapidly, like Omicron, population structure and heterogeneity play only a small role in dictating the overall rate and magnitude of the epidemic, as long as subpopulations are not entirely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, allowing for under-reporting of official case count data before Nov. 11, over-reporting of symptoms in the Dec. 26 survey, uncertainty in parameter values taken from the literature, or population sub-structure did not change our conclusions.\n\nModel validation using additional datasets\n\nWe furthermore validated our results by comparing them against datasets and analyses that were not used in the inference above. First, China CDC subsequently released data on voluntary PCR and antigen tests for most of Dec. 2022 and Jan. 20235. After the full exit from zero-COVID, the test strategy was changed from all population-based to those who request to be tested and groups at risk. The total number of tests declined from a peak of 150 million tests on Dec. 9, to 7.54 million on Jan. 1. The test positivity rate ranged between a few percent to a peak of 29.4% on Dec. 255. Although these data may not directly reveal the magnitude of the true case counts because of the voluntary nature of the reports, they can reveal the pace and the peak timing of the epidemic. We adjusted our model predictions to reflect the nature of voluntary tests (see “Methods”), and found surprisingly close agreement with the national testing data in Dec. 2022 (Fig. 3).\n\nSecond, the Sichuan CDC conducted a large daily survey in which residents of the province reported their infection status, the date of test positivity, and the date of symptom onset17. We found that the exponential growth rate of the epidemic in early Dec. in Sichuan, as measured by test positivity or symptom onset (0.37/day or 0.43/day, respectively; Fig. S8) is remarkably consistent with our estimates above for the country as a whole.\n\nThird, an analysis of self-reported infection rate focused on vaccine efficacy but also reported an epidemic curve18. Based on 2316 survey responses, the study reported that 82.4% of people in China had confirmed cases by Feb. 2023. This number excludes, however, asymptomatic cases that were not revealed by testing. If 9% of infected people never developed symptoms (median value from Fig. S1) and most of those cases were not caught by testing (due to the lack of mandatory testing and the lack of incentive for most non-symptomatic people to test themselves, leading to the high test positivity rate by end-Dec5.), it is likely that more than 90% of people in that survey had been infected. The small sample size of that survey would also induce large uncertainty, leading to a result for the final epidemic size that is not inconsistent with our model-based analysis on larger datasets.\n\nWe modeled the epidemic dynamics of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in China from Nov. to Dec. 2022, during a period when China moved from having strict COVID-19 policies (‘zero-COVID’), to little-to-no intervention efforts. We found that after full exit from zero-COVID, the Omicron variant spread at a very high rate of 0.42/day, with a doubling time of 1.6 days, during early and mid-Dec. before the incidence peaked around Dec. 23. Our point estimate is that 97% of the population (1.4 billion people) was infected during December, with a lower 95% credibility interval of 95% of the population (1.33 billion) and a lower limit in the sensitivity analyses of 90% (1.26 billion). With an infection fatality ratio between 0.1 and 0.2% for the Omicron variant19, we would expect between 1.3 and 2.6 million COVID-19 deaths in China during Dec. 2022 as well as Jan. 2023 (because of the delay from infection to death).\n\nInfection of more than one billion people during one month would lead to a large number of people needing health care, far exceeding the hospital capacity, and thus explains the report that hospitals were overwhelmed during this period6. This outcome emphasizes the need for gradually relaxing intervention efforts (instead of abruptly changing policy) and implementing additional measures (e.g., pharmaceutical strategies) to ‘flatten the curve’9. A slower epidemic wave would help to ease hospital burden, allow sufficient health care for infected people, prevent epidemic overshoot (i.e., a large final epidemic size because of rapid spread20), and ultimately reduce the number of deaths. Such considerations may be of renewed importance later in 2023, when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 may become susceptible to reinfection.\n\nOur results differ from a recent paper by Leung et al.21 that modeled the epidemic dynamics in Beijing over a similar period. First, they estimated that the highest rate of epidemic growth occurred in mid-Nov., a period when substantial intervention efforts were still in place, whereas our estimates suggest the rate of epidemic growth was highest after the full exit from zero-COVID. Second, they estimated that the epidemic incidence in Beijing had two peaks (one on Dec. 10 and another on Dec. 21), whereas we estimated the epidemic in China as a whole peaked on Dec. 23, remarkably consistent with the newly released data from China CDC5 (Fig. 3). These results in Leung et al.21 are strongly driven by the assumption that the overall contact rate is a function of the daily number of subway travelers, which peaked mid-November. However, it is unclear how the number of subway passengers is related to transmission, given that a large fraction of transmission likely occurs in the household22. More generally, it has been shown that human mobility after the first wave of the epidemic in 2020 relates to changes in transmission in complex ways23; the relationship between the mobility measures and transmission can be insignificant in many countries, country-specific, or intervention policy-specific. As a result, the results in Leung et al.21 could be biased by this strong assumption.\n\nOne limitation of our analysis is that it is heavily dependent on the online infection status survey data on Dec. 26. We directly addressed two concerns about these data. First, the survey could over-state the progression of the epidemic if people with symptoms are more likely to take the survey, or if people mistake influenza for COVID-19 symptoms. Recent data from the China CDC report5 shows that among individuals who had influenza-like illnesses and were tested for both COVID-19 and influenza, only a very small fraction were positive for influenza, especially in late Dec. Nevertheless, we artificially increased the proportion of uninfected people in the survey and obtained very similar results. Second, because the survey was conducted online, the demographic characteristics of the participants may be different from the general population. In particular, if a substantial subpopulation did not participate in the survey and also experienced lower rates of spread—for example, people living in sparsely populated areas—our estimate of the total number of people infected could be too high. We tested this assumption by fitting a structured population model and obtained very similar results. Finally, we validated our model findings against other data sources that were not used in our model inference. We found strong concordance with both the estimated peak time of the epidemic and its growth trajectory. These many lines of evidence strongly suggest that our estimation is reliable and robust, despite the limitations of the available data.\n\nAnother piece of evidence supporting our conclusion is the lack of a COVID-19 wave in January 2023 (for example, see the China CDC report5). The Chinese New Year travel rush, i.e., during which many migrant workers and students go back to hometown to celebrate the Chinese New Year, occurred in Jan., and a large fraction of these travel routes would be from cities to rural villages. Presumably, this travel rush would increase the frequency of risky contact substantially throughout China. The fact that there is no indication of any sizable COVID outbreak during this period (e.g., indicators of COVID-19 infection, including positive tests and fever clinic visits, decreased continuously throughout Jan. 20235) strongly suggests that a large majority of individuals are already infected in Dec., as we predicted in the model.\n\nBroader implications for understanding the transmission of the Omicron variant and for public health\n\nUnlike most other countries where there existed sizable levels of population immunity against the Omicron variant arising from recent natural infection and/or vaccination, we estimated that the population in China had very little to no protection against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the growth rate 0.42/day (translating to an epidemic doubling time of 1.6 days) during the exponential growth period we estimated may be a good approximation of the intrinsic transmissibility of the variants BA.5 and BF.7 in a densely populated area without population immunity. This is in stark contrast to the growth rate 0.29/day (and an epidemic doubling time of 2.4 days) that we estimated for the Wuhan outbreak before intervention efforts were in place in Jan. 202024. This highlights the extremely high intrinsic transmissibility of the Omicron variant in a naive population.\n\nAssuming a mean generation interval of 3.3 days16, we estimated the reproductive number during exponential growth, Rexp to be 3.1. Note that a recent study using contact tracing data from Italy estimated the intrinsic generation time to be 6.8 days25, although the realized generation time for household transmission where frequent contacts occur between family members was 3.6 days. This relatively large difference in the estimated generation times suggests another layer of complexity in calculating the reproductive number, i.e., it depends on whether the transmission is mostly driven by household transmission (frequent contacts) or non-household transmission (less frequent contacts), which may change in different epidemiological contexts and epidemic stages. The reproductive number, Rexp, we calculated here is likely accurate when the transmission is dominated by household transmission, e.g., when prevalence is relatively high in a community. However, at the beginning of an epidemic when only a few individuals are infected, the transmission is likely to be a mixture of household and non-household transmission; in this case, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be higher than Rexp we estimated here.\n\nQuantifying the growth rates before and after zero-COVID, we estimated these intervention efforts reduced the transmission of the Omicron variant by around 56%. As a comparison, the effect of lock-down during the spread of the original variant in early 2020 was estimated to be 70–80% in Europe26. Interestingly, the Omicron outbreak in China had already been growing in Nov. 2022 before the relaxation of zero-COVID (albeit at a low rate). This may reflect the high transmissibilty of the variant, and that the stringent measures of the zero-COVID policy were not effectively implemented because of factors such as population noncompliance due to pandemic fatigue. Nonetheless, these results highlight the difficulty of containing a respiratory infection that causes explosive outbreaks and transmits during the presymptomatic or asymptomatic period.\n\nBecause the epidemic grew so rapidly in Dec., we may expect another sizable wave of infection later in 2023 when the large cohort of people infected at the end of 2022 become susceptible to reinfection. The timing and magnitude of the future wave would depend on how quickly the population immunity wanes over time27,28,29 and the ability of newly emerging variants to evade the immunity caused by the Omicron variants30,31. Therefore, modeling efforts that evaluate intervention strategies, including vaccination, will be crucial to reduce the level of infection and mortality.\n\nDatasets and sources\n\nOfficial case counts\n\nNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China had been releasing reports on COVID-19 infections from the beginning of the pandemic until Dec. 23, 202232. These reports include numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic, imported and recovered infections, and deaths across the country. Because the definitions of ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ infections have been changing over time, we use only the total number of cases by summing the two categories. We retrieved all official data from Sina Pandemic Map33, which provides pre-processed and well-organized daily case data from NHC. Note the NHC data are also used as a source for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard34.\n\nPrevalence survey on Dec. 26, 2022\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2022, the RenSheTong online platform (https://m12333.cn), a website for the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, conducted a one-day online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in China13. There were 47,897 participants in total. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was reported in four categories. ‘Uninfected’ was defined as individuals who had never tested positive or were unaware they were infected. ‘Asymptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive, but did not have symptoms of infection at the time of the survey. ‘Symptomatic’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they were infected, and were experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey. ‘Recovered’ was defined as individuals who had tested positive or thought they had been infected by COVID-19 in the past, and had recovered from symptoms of infection. We interpreted the last category to imply recovered from recent infection, i.e., in end-2022, but there would be little consequence if it also included people who had been infected in previous years because <1% of the population had been infected prior to Nov. 202234. Survey questions are reproduced in Table S2 and survey results by province are provided in a supplemental data file. Because of the small number of respondents in the Asymptomatic category, our analyses folded them in with the Uninfected category, which already included individuals who could be infected but without symptoms. Note that in the survey 95% of infected people reported symptoms, which is consistent with the fraction of infections estimated to be symptomatic by our model (Fig. S1). We computed the total number of people in each survey category under the assumption that the proportion of survey respondents in each category was representative of the respective province as a whole. That is, the prevalences in Fig. 1b are the country’s total population size multiplied by 28.3% Uninfected, 42.5% Infected, and 29.2% Recovered.\n\nParticipants in the survey were also asked about the duration of symptoms. We fitted an Erlang distribution to the survey data by estimating the mean of the distribution and adjusting the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution from 1 to 10.\n\nChinese CDC reports of number of positive tests after Dec. 9, 2022\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released national COVID-19 pandemic data on Jan. 25, 2023, including PCR test results, antigen test results, outpatient and inpatient data, variant surveillance data, and vaccination progress across the country5. Data were collected from official surveillance systems, labs, hospitals, and mobile applications where residents could upload their antigen test results voluntarily. We used daily numbers of positive PCR and antigen tests and daily test positivity rates.\n\nSichuan survey on Dec. 25 and 26, 2022\n\nThe Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Health conducted an online survey of the COVID-19 infection status for people living in Sichuan province on Dec. 24 and 2517. There were a total of 158,506 participants. In the questionnaire, participants were asked about their infection status and their duration of symptoms. Infection status was categorized as ‘uninfected’ or ‘tested positive either by PCR or antigen test.’ In addition, participants reported the date that they tested positive and the date of their symptom onset.\n\nCopies of all datasets are included as supplemental files.\n\nThe expanded SEIR model\n\nWe developed an SEIR-type model to encompass not only the daily case counts from extensive official testing, but also the survey data in which respondents’ answers were based on symptoms. In this model, we categorized the population into 12 classes, plus 2 additional classes for bookkeeping: S for susceptible, E1 and E2 for exposed, IP for pre-symptomatic and infectious, IS for symptomatic and infectious, RS1, RS2, and RS3 for recovered from infectiousness but still symptomatic, RS for recovered and no longer with symptoms, IA1 and IA2 for asymptomatic and infectious, and RA for recovered and never having symptoms. Multiple stages were used for some categories (e.g., stages E1 and E2 for the exposed category) in order to obtain more realistic distributions of waiting times35, as discussed below. States T1 and T2 were used to record individuals who test positive, in order to compare with daily case counts. Figure 2 shows how individuals transit from one class to another. Parameters ki govern the rates of flow from one class to the next, f is the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms, and w is the proportion of cases found by testing. The system of equations defining this model is:\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N$$\n\n(1a)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{1}}{dt}=\\beta ({I}_{P}+{I}_{S}+{I}_{A1}+{I}_{A2})S/N-{k}_{E}{E}_{1}$$\n\n(1b)\n\n$$\\frac{d{E}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{E}{E}_{1}-{k}_{E}{E}_{2}$$\n\n(1c)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{P}}{dt}={k}_{E}f{E}_{2}-{k}_{IP}{I}_{P}$$\n\n(1d)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{IP}{I}_{P}-{k}_{IS}{I}_{S}$$\n\n(1e)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S1}}{dt}={k}_{IS}{I}_{S}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S1}$$\n\n(1f)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S2}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S1}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S2}$$\n\n(1g)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S3}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S2}-{k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1h)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{S}}{dt}={k}_{S}{R}_{S3}$$\n\n(1i)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A1}}{dt}={k}_{E}(1-f){E}_{2}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A1}$$\n\n(1j)\n\n$$\\frac{d{I}_{A2}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A1}-{k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1k)\n\n$$\\frac{d{R}_{A}}{dt}={k}_{A}{I}_{A2}$$\n\n(1l)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{1}}{dt}={k}_{E}w{E}_{2}-{k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1m)\n\n$$\\frac{d{T}_{2}}{dt}={k}_{T}{T}_{1}$$\n\n(1n)\n\nIn this model, susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals (in compartments IP + IS + IA1 + IA2) through contacts at rate β. Infected individuals first become exposed but not infectious. We used two compartments (E1 and E2) to model this period to reflect the fact that the distribution of the exposed period (i.e., from infection to becoming infectious) usually follows a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution. Exposed individuals then become infectious, and IP and IS represent infectious individuals at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively. Individuals lose infectiousness a few days after symptom onset36, whereas symptoms may last for a longer period of time. Stages RS1, RS2, and RS3 describe symptomatic individuals who are no longer infectious. Again, using three stages allows us to match the distribution of the symptomatic period to the distribution estimated from data13. Note that, in the survey, participants in the ‘infected’ category were categorized based on whether the participants have COVID symptoms or not. Therefore, the ‘infected’ category corresponds to individuals in the states IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3. When individuals recover from symptoms, they enter state RS.\n\nOur model also keeps track of asymptomatically infected individuals, i.e., individuals who never develop symptoms throughout infection. In the model, we assume a fraction, 1 − f, of individuals remain asymptomatic after the exposed period. We use two IA stages to describe the duration of infectious period as a gamma distribution. RA keeps track of individuals recovered from asymptomatic infection. We do not differentiate the stages of individuals recovering from asymptomatic infection (as we did for individuals recovering from symptomatic infection) because individuals in all of these stages would have reported as the same category in the symptoms-based survey, and they remain in this class.\n\nOverall, our model structure allowed us to map our model states to the categories in the Dec. 26 online survey. People who reported themselves ‘uninfected’ could be truly susceptible (S), asymptomatic but exposed (E1, E2) or infected (IA1, IA2), or recovered never having had symptoms (RA). People who reported themselves ‘infected’ were experiencing symptoms, so they could be still infectious (IS) or no longer infectious (RS1, RS2, RS3). People reporting themselves ‘recovered’ were no longer experiencing symptoms (RS).\n\nTo fit the model to official COVID-19 case counts, we used T1 and T2 to keep track of individuals who would eventually be tested. Note that they do not contribute to the transmission dynamics. Parameter w is the fraction of infected individuals who are tested, and it ranges between 0 and 1. The waiting time from becoming infectious to being tested positive is 1/kT.\n\nParameter values and statistical inference\n\nWe fixed most of the parameters in the model to values estimated from epidemiological studies. We used an incubation period for Omicron of mean 3.4 days37 and a generation interval for Omicron of mean 3.3 days16. Both distributions can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 3, so in our model there are three states describing individuals who are infected but yet to develop symptoms (E1, E2, and IP). We then set the rate parameters kE = 2/1.9 /day and kIP = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean pre-symptomatic infectious period is 1.5 days38 and total incubation period is 3.4 days37, and kIS = 1/1.5 /day so that the mean infectious period after symptom onset is 1.5 days.\n\nWe estimated from the population survey data (Table S2) that the distribution of the symptomatic period can be approximated by a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.7 days and a shape parameter of 413. Therefore, in our model, we used four states to represent the symptomatic period (IS, RS1, RS2, and RS3), and we set kS = 3/4.2 /day such that the mean duration that an individual is in the RS1, RS2 or RS3 state is 4.2 days and thus the mean symptomatic period is 4.2 + 1.5 = 5.7 days. We also set 2/kA = 1/kIP + 1/kIS such that the mean infectious period of the asymptomatically infected is assumed the same as symptomatically infected. Parameter values are summarized in Table S3.\n\nOur model contained six free parameters: the transmission rate during each of the three periods (βi), the fraction of infected individuals who eventually develop symptoms (f), an initial number of exposed individuals in mid-Oct. (E0), and an overdispersion parameter for the count data (ϕ), which were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.\n\nFor the initial condition of the ODE system, we assumed an entirely susceptible population except for E1 = E2 ≡ E0 on Oct. 22, one week before the beginning of the case count data we fit. This is consistent with very little pre-existing immunity through either prior natural infection (<1% of the population had ever been infected by this time34) or vaccination (Fig. S2). The model was fit using Bayesian inference and implemented in the Stan programming language39. We set the prior distribution of each βi to be normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 2, the prior on f to be uniform between 0 and 1, the prior on E0 to be uniform between 1 and ten times the number of cases on the first day of data, and the prior on ϕ−1 to be exponential with mean 5. These are weak priors, and the posterior estimates (shown in Fig. S1) were not sensitive to them.\n\nThe growth rate, r, during the exponential growth period of the outbreak was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the ODE system, Eq. 1, assuming the population is fully susceptible (i.e., S = N).\n\nCalculation of the reproductive number during exponential growth, R exp\n\nWe used the growth rates, r, of SARS-CoV-2 in China estimated in this study and the distribution of the intrinsic generation interval to calculate the reproductive number Rexp. This is the estimated instantaneous reproductive number during the exponential growth phase of the outbreak after Dec. 8 and before the peak. According to Abbott et al.16, the distribution of the generation interval has a mean of 3.3 days and a shape parameter close to 3. Rexp is then calculated using the formula provided in Park et al.40:\n\n$${R}_{exp}=\\frac{1}{\\int\\,g(\\tau )\\exp (-r\\tau )d\\tau }$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g is the density function of the intrinsic generation interval distribution.\n\nRegression to estimate exponential growth rates\n\nThe rates of exponential growth in Sichuan province during Dec. 2022 were estimated by fitting a linear regression model to the fractions of COVID-19-positive individuals or individuals whose symptoms began between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The Dec. 1 data point was ignored because it is likely to include individuals who tested positive or started to have symptoms before Dec. 1. The fitting was performed using the lm() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nWe estimated the rate of exponential growth using the official case count data by fitting a generalized negative binomial regression to the case count time series. Fitting was performed with the glm.nb() function in the R programming environment41.\n\nEstimating population immunity against Omicron infection\n\nLau et al.15 estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the CoronaVac vaccine against Omicron infection: 7 days following immunization, the VE for the second and third doses were 5% (0–27%) and 30% (1–66%), respectively, and then the VE reduced exponentially to 1% (0–11%) and 6% (0–29%), respectively, 100 days after immunization. We used these values in our calculation, assuming that all the vaccines administered in China follow the same VE characteristics as CoronaVac. We then collected data on the fractions of people who already received two doses or three doses of vaccine over time from ref. 14 (Fig. S2a). From this dataset, we estimated the fractions of people newly vaccinated with their second or third dose over the entire period of consideration. Note that the fourth dose of vaccine was not authorized in China until mid-Dec. 2022, and therefore we did not include the fourth dose in our calculation.\n\nWe calculated the population immunity against Omicron on day d, P(d), as\n\n$$P(d)=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i={d}_{0}}^{d}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=2}^{3}{G}_{j}(d-i){Q}_{j}(i)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qj(i) is the fraction newly vaccinated with the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i, and Gj(d − i) is the VE on day d given an individual received the second or the third dose (j = 2 or 3, respectively) on day i. The expected and upper bound estimates (Fig. S2b) were made using the expected and upper bound estimates of the VE.\n\nRobustness of conclusions to existence of population structure\n\nWe considered the impact of population structure on the main conclusions of our model. If population structure exists such that people who have high contact rates (and thus potentially more exposure to infection) are also more likely to be represented in the data, our results could over-state the total number of infected people by failing to recognize subpopulations that remain uninfected because of their lower contact rates. For example, people who live in urban areas with good internet access and health care facilities may be more likely to be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey, while also experiencing more opportunity for infection; whereas people living in rural areas (far away from testing facilities and with poor internet connections) may not be included in the COVID-19 testing and online survey. Another example is that people in younger age groups may have larger numbers of contacts and be more likely to participate in online surveys than people in older age groups.\n\nTo capture this effect as simply as possible, we included two subpopulations: one with high contact rates and the other with low contact rates, with an even lower rate of contact between the two subpopulations. Specifically, we assumed that during each time period, the transmission rate in the low-contact subpopulation was half that of the high-contact subpopulation, and the transmission rate between subpopulations was one-tenth as large. We also assumed that the official case counts and the Dec. 26 survey data were taken from the population with higher contact rates (the sampled population) and the population with lower contact rates (the unsampled population) was not represented in the datasets. The full model structure is provided in Fig. S6.\n\nWe first partitioned the entire country’s population to be 65% in the high-contact subpopulation and 35% in the low-contact subpopulation. This partition is motivated by the nationwide urban–rural proportion. Because the Dec. 26 survey includes participants from both urban and rural areas, this division represents an overestimate of the size of the unsampled population. Indeed, the majority of population in China has good internet access (through cell phones) and access to COVID-testing sites. Therefore we additionally considered a model where the population is partitioned to be 80% in the high-contact subpopulation and 20% in the low-contact subpopulation, which is probably more appropriate with respect to the survey data. We fit both models to the official case count data and the Dec. 26 survey data as in the main text. Irrespective of the partition, our results from this model were consistent with our main findings. For the 80%–20% and 65%–35% partitions, respectively, we found an epidemic peak on Dec. 23 or Dec. 24, and only 2.6% or 6.7% of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of December (Fig. S7ab).\n\nWe further tested a scenario where the partition is 80% and 20% for the sampled and unsampled subpopulations, respectively, and transmission between the subpopulations was only one-hundredth of the transmission rate within the sampled subpopulation. Note that this is an extreme and unlikely scenario where the two subpopulations were not well connected at all. We found that infection in the low-contact subpopulation lagged behind the high-contact subpopulation even more than in the previous scenarios, as expected (Fig. S7c). The amount of the entire population remaining susceptible by the end of Dec. increased slightly to 10.9%, and the epidemic peak remained on Dec. 23.\n\nModel adjustment for testing intensity and willingness in the China CDC data\n\nWe compared the fitted model trajectory against the China CDC data to validate our model estimations. For this, we multiplied the total cases predicted by the model by a factor to correct for testing effort and the willingness to get tested. We defined\n\n$$T=C\\frac{{n}_{T}/{p}_{T}}{(N-R)v},$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the model-adjusted inferred number of positive tests (plotted as colored bands in Fig. 3), C is the total number of model-predicted cases (gray band in Fig. 3), nT is the number of positive tests, pT is the test positivity rate, N is the total country population size, R is the number of individuals in the recovered non-symptomatic model states (RS + RA), and v is an unknown factor related to the proportion of the population that engages in voluntary testing. The term (N − R)v reflects that not all individuals engage in the testing and among those who engage, individuals who know they are recovered likely do not get tested or self-test any more. Values of all the quantities in Eq. (4) are known for each day—from the model fit or the reported data—except for v. We estimated a single value of v (across all days) for each testing type by least-squares fitting, using Eq. (4), obtaining v = 0.44 for the PCR tests and v = 0.52 for the antigen tests.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40940-4', 'Headline': 'Effects of public-health measures for zeroing out different ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'Based on a multi-year empirical dataset containing 131 outbreaks observed in China from April 2020 to May 2022 and simulated scenarios, we ranked the relative intervention effectiveness by their reduction in instantaneous reproduction number.', 'Full_text': 'Effects of zero-COVID interventions against different variants in China\n\nFrom April 2020 to May 2022, 90 prefecture-level Chinese cities reported 131 outbreaks that had at least 50 cases and lasted at least 7 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These included 12 outbreaks caused by the pre-Delta variants (i.e., lineages B.1.1, B.2, and B.1.1.7), 27 outbreaks of the Delta variant, and 92 outbreaks of the Omicron lineages. The implementation of zero-COVID policy was heterogeneous across regions and over time (Fig. 1c). For example, on a regional average, the intensity of stay-at-home order in South Central and Southwest China decreased from 0.5 in Pre-Delta era to 0.4 in Omicron era, while mass screening had an intensity increasing from 0.1 to ~0.3 in most regions (Note that the intensity of each measure was normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the strictest and 0 indicates the least strict). This indicates that affected cities in southern China eased some stringent measures, such as stay-at-home order, and increased the frequency of PCR testing. Based on the data of these outbreaks and Bayesian inference models with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach30, we estimated the effects of four groups of interventions, i.e., social distancing measures, nucleic acid PCR screening, contact tracing, and facial masking, under the policy for fully interrupting the transmission in local communities. As Fig. 2a shows, overall, social distancing measures, through reducing the spread caused by human movements and physical contact, had the most desirable effect on the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\) (>38%), while facial masking (mean 30%, 95% prediction interval 17–42%) and contact tracing (28%, 24–31%) showed a lower impact, respectively.\n\nSocial distancing measures similarly showed a strong ability to reduce transmission before the Delta-variant outbreaks (over 50%). However, during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks, social distancing measures with a 30% and 33% reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\), respectively, were relatively less effective at preventing transmission than they were before the Delta era. For facial masking, the lowest contribution to transmission reduction (24%, −1%–60%) was shown in the pre-Delta era. In the Delta era, it demonstrated a moderate \\({R}_{t}\\) reduction of 43% (20%-64%), while in the more recent Omicron era, it showed the highest effectiveness of 53% (32%-64%). In addition, contact tracing demonstrated the highest ability to reduce transmission (24%, 0%–47%) after the emergence of the Omicron variant, ranking second among the original and Alpha strains (12%, 0%-46%). Mass PCR screening showed various abilities to reduce \\({R}_{t}\\) among pre-Delta (11, 0%–45%), Delta (3%, −1–15%), and Omicron era (2%, −1–13%).\n\nNevertheless, when the 131 COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into four groups based on infectivity and duration, we found that PCR screening, which focused on detecting each infected individual in communities, was more effective in combating outbreaks that had sustainable transmission. Contact tracing played a critical role in containing outbreaks in the early stages, particularly for small outbreaks (32%, 95%CI 28–35%). However, as transmission continued, the relative impact of contact tracing decreased (from 32% to 2%), while social distancing emerged as the most effective measure (from 34% to 62%). More details can be found in supplementary Section B.7.\n\nTo further validate the effects of NPIs estimated by Bayesian inference, we employed an Intervention-SEIR-Vaccination (ISEIRV) model to simulate transmission under varying real-world and counterfactual intervention scenarios (e.g., without implementing one or all NPIs, see Fig. 2b). We found the implementation of NPIs protected >98% of the would-be infected populations from infection in each city. The prompt implementation of, and stringent adherence to, NPIs protected 80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55–110) million people from infection during the same periods of real-world outbreaks in the affected areas. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of each NPI in reducing infections under different variants by simulating transmission in the absence of NPI implementation. The results corroborate the ranking of NPI effects inferred by the Bayesian model (Fig. 2).\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects that need to be considered when interpreting the above findings. First, this study did not assess the effects of long-lasting international travel restrictions and quarantine for reducing the introduction risk, which might overestimate the impact of other interventions in containing local transmission within each city. Second, the small-scale, short-duration outbreaks were excluded from the modeling, which might have led to an underestimation of the effectiveness of some NPIs, such as contact tracing, that might also play an important role in controlling epidemics in the early phases.\n\nImpacts of timing and intensity on NPI effects\n\nTo further understand how the timing and intensity of various NPIs shaped their effectiveness in containing emerging infections under different settings, we ran simulations for different cities, including five large population-size cities (LC), five medium population-size cities (MC), and five small population-size cities (SC), where Omicron outbreaks occurred (Supplementary Table 9). Each group of simulations contained transmission curves for 1800 scenarios, of which four NPIs with ten levels of intensity were implemented at five different start times under nine combinations of propagation parameters (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, and 13; Latent period = 1, 4, and 7 days). Fig. 3 shows the relative reduction of daily mean infections for each scenario in different population-size cities, relative to the baseline scenario without any interventions implemented.\n\nWe found universally that the sooner all NPIs were in place, the more effective they were. The more contagious the pathogen and the longer the latent period was, the more necessary it was to introduce NPIs as early as possible. Meanwhile, a smaller population means a shorter window of timing for NPI implementation, as the susceptible population would be depleted more quickly in smaller cities. Among the four NPI groups, contact tracing proved to be the most effective measure across city sizes, showing more effectiveness at intensities above 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 in LCs, MCs, and SCs, respectively. However, when the start time exceeded a certain threshold (~25 days), the effect of contact tracing fell dramatically even at the highest intensity across both MCs and LCs. The second-ranked intervention was social distancing measures, particularly in containing the spread of infectious diseases in LCs. We also found that a higher intensity of NPI was necessary for diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter latent periods. Facial masking showed similar effects among all cities, but the effect of large-scale testing diminished as the population increased.\n\nOptimal intervention packages and challenges in zeroing out emerging infections under varying scenarios\n\nTo seek the optimal combination of interventions, we simulated the infection profile with two or more NPIs implemented simultaneously under different outbreak parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and supplementary Section D.1, we traversed each combined scenario of intervention strategies as well as the start time and intensity in LC, MC, and SC settings. Since the long-term implementation of NPIs usually requires enormous resource and livelihood sacrifice31,32, a simulated policy scheme that failed to stop the transmission within 3 months (90 days) or where the outbreak infects >10,000 people was deemed ineffective, considering the policy’s potential socioeconomic and secondary health impacts (e.g., overwhelmed healthcare)33,34,35.\n\nWe found that implementing NPIs after day 14 of the outbreak would fail to interrupt transmission within 60 days when \\({R}_{0}\\) exceeded 8. When \\({R}_{0}\\) was <3, contact tracing coupled with a mask-wearing order can effectively contain the outbreak within 60 days, regardless of a city’s population size. As the latent period grew or the population size increased, the time cost of zeroing infections would increase concomitantly. For all cities, tracing and isolating at least 60% of close contacts by day 7 of outbreaks was generally effective. However, if the start of intervention was delayed until day 14, the intensity of contact tracing might need to be increased to 70% contacts traced for MCs and 80% contacts traced for LCs.\n\nContaining infectious diseases with higher transmissibility and shorter incubation period could be particularly challenging using NPIs alone. To effectively prevent an outbreak (\\({R}_{0}\\) = 13 and latent period = 4) from escalating into pandemic, cities might start interventions within a week of the outbreak, coupled with efficient close contact tracing (>70%) and relatively rigorous social distancing measures (>0.5). For areas with more dense populations (e.g., LCs), the strictest measures were necessary to zero a highly transmissible disease (e.g., infections with an \\({R}_{0}\\) of 13) within 3 months. That means a significant investment of time, effort, and resources that might not be feasible for a long time in the real-world.\n\nBased on China’s zero-COVID practice and data in 2020–2022, we evaluated the impact of different public-health interventions for eliminating emerging respiratory viral infections in diverse settings. We found that containing highly transmissible infectious diseases with short incubation periods through NPIs can be particularly challenging, due to the relatively heterogeneous effectiveness of interventions under varying epidemiological and socioeconomic contexts. The relative effect of public-health measures on zeroing out transmission was sensitive to the infectivity of pathogens, the timing and intensity of NPIs, and combinations of interventions, which should be considered in tailoring response strategies at different stages of an emerging epidemic or pandemic in various regions14,15,36. For instance, similar to findings in the United Kingdom37 and the United States38, contact tracing was found to be more effective than social distancing and large-scale tests at the early stages of outbreaks, in curbing transmission by pinpointing the infected individuals and isolating close contacts in communities39,40,41,42, while social distancing represents a general requirement applied to all individuals in an area, regardless of people’s infection or exposure status. However, if there are many scattered cases or a significant proportion of the population infected in the middle to late stages of the outbreak, we might expect social distancing and masking to work better than mass screening and contact tracing37,43,44. In places with considerable population flow, contact tracing and mass screening might be more effective than social distancing and masking in reducing imported infections40,45. Nonetheless, mass testing could be increasingly laborious and time-consuming facing a large population size. Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections might also weaken the impact of population-scale testing, as many infected individuals cannot be identified or the gatherings in test sites could potentially increase the risk of transmission46. Nevertheless, facial masking played a most stable role, especially given its role in reducing the risk of transmission in households or indoor settings46,47,48,49,50. In light of this, many governments worldwide have responded to the emergence of COVID-19 by enacting legislation mandating mask usage in public places51. Additionally, the continued significance of mask-wearing as a vital tool in East Asia to control the spread of respiratory infections is well-documented52.\n\nThe surge of cases and delayed responses during an outbreak might overwhelm the system of tracing and testing53, leading to a reduction in the likelihood of cases being properly identified. In such scenarios, social distancing measures could play a more important role for containing outbreaks that have spread widely, showing its stronger cumulative effects in simulations over a longer time period. These measures might be relatively effective, straightforward, and easy to implement14,54, compared to other interventions that require changes in individual health behaviors (such as mask wearing) or involve the deployment of resources (such as testing kits and laboratories). Moreover, as highlighted by Brauner et al.30, the combined implementation of certain NPIs has the potential to yield even more optimal effectiveness in mitigating pandemics. However, maintaining the social distancing policy over time could lead to potential adverse consequences, including negative socioeconomic and mental health impacts55,56,57. Governments and health departments, therefore, should remain vigilant and shift their strategies as appropriate.\n\nWhile the data from the zero-COVID policy provided real-world evidence of interventions for zeroing out outbreaks caused by variants with different severities, however, the lack of knowledge about emerging contagions renders challenges in conceiving precise NPIs packages as well as their efficient implementation. Simulated outbreaks indicated that tracing and isolation alone can control outbreaks caused by less transmissible contagions. Nevertheless, if a disease with high clinical severity spreads rapidly in a population, further social distancing interventions like school closures and gathering restrictions might be necessary as supplements. In addition, as the transmissibility increased, social distancing measures might show a decreasing and lagged impact in reducing the spread in communities58,59. We note that rapid growth in the number of cases caused by a highly contagious disease would narrow the control window, a time delay where spread can be contained, and a reminder that the timeliness to implement these universal NPIs is key. However, the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (88%, IQR 41%–100%) observed during the Omicron waves highlights the need for strong organizational proficiency and resource allocation readiness to enable timely interventions and prevent further infections60,61,62. NPIs may therefore have a limited role in containing highly transmissible infectious diseases rapidly, and a mitigation strategy may be the alternative solution63. There are several limitations to our study. First, we only focused on the role of NPIs in interrupting the transmission of emerging infectious diseases, which we assumed have serious health consequences in terms of hospitalization or mortality. This study did not explore the feasibility of these zero-infection strategies by assessing their direct or indirect socioeconomic costs and health benefits in varying settings. Second, although national guidelines for COVID-19 responses in China have been issued and modified according to the changing situations of the pandemic and the virus64, local governments were relatively independent in terms of NPI implementation, rendering challenges in quantifying the intensity and subtle changes of interventions in each study outbreak. Third, our conclusions resulted from the assumption of independent effects of NPIs. However, it is important to recognize that public-health measures with different mechanisms may exhibit synergistic effects, such as mask wearing and social distancing, or vaccination with NPIs24. We plan to further explore these synergistic effects in the future.\n\nData sources and processing\n\nEpidemiological data\n\nData sources for outbreaks included press releases from local government websites or reports from the local disease control and prevention agencies at the province, city/prefecture, and district/county levels, as well as updates from official social media accounts of governments or health departments (supplementary Section A). For each outbreak, we collected the basic information of location, start and end dates, strains, and suspected sources, as well as the daily number of new infections and cases identified among close contacts who had been isolated and quarantined. Based on the case information reported from official sources, we defined the onset of an outbreak as the date when new non-isolated cases started to increase. The end of an outbreak was defined as the date when zero new cases were initially reported, followed by a consecutive period of more than 7 days with no new infections. When an outbreak displayed two or more discernible peaks, with a sustained period of over 5 days between these peaks characterized by zero new cases, we designated the appearance of new cases as the beginning of a new wave. To ensure a sufficient sample size for assessing intervention effects, we ruled out the outbreaks that had <50 cases or lasted less than 7 days. Ultimately, a total of 131 outbreaks were employed in the following analyses.\n\nPublic-health measures\n\nFor each outbreak, we collected the corresponding public-health measures from the websites of local governments. The collected public-health measures include: (1) stay-at-home order (SO), (2) business premises closures (BPC), (3) public transportation closures (PTC), (4) gathering restrictions (GR), (5) workplace closures (WC), (6) school closures (SC), (7) facial masking (FM), (8) mass PCR screening (MS), (9) medicine management (MM), and 10) contact tracing (CT). Nine of the indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale representing the level of policy stringency. In China, both MS and CT were deemed essential approaches for infection detection and tracing but differ in definition and implementation as follows. Mass screening was typically conducted for individuals without a clear exposure history but who were at risk of exposure, such as those residing in the same community as a confirmed case. Only if a positive test result was obtained, the individual would be quarantined, and until then they were allowed to move around. However, close contact tracing refers to the detection and isolation of individuals with a history of exposure to a case. These individuals were regularly tested for COVID-19 nucleic acid during the quarantine period. More details on data processing and synthesis can be found in the supplementary Section A.\n\nControl variables\n\nThe trajectory of infectious diseases can also be influenced by some confounders like weather, season, and vaccination via the effect on viral activity and human behavior. Confounders considered in this study were daily temperature, humidity, population density, and vaccination rate. We derived the daily mean temperature and humidity within each city with data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) from Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS 2.1), a dataset with a combination of model and satellite- and ground-based observation data65. However, we excluded humidity as a control variable in our model, due to its high collinearity with air temperature. Population density obtained from http://www.stats.gov.cn/. Vaccination data at the province level were collected from http://www.nhc.gov.cn/. Although inactivated vaccines seem to have low efficacy to prevent Omicron infections among the population66,67, vaccination data were processed as a practical vaccination rate, based on the full vaccination rates and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (see Supplementary Table 2). Please see supplementary Section A.3 for more details on vaccine data processing.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical clearance for collecting and using secondary data in this study was granted by the institutional review board of the University of Southampton (No. 61865). All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personal identifying information.\n\nBayesian inference model\n\nWe built a Bayesian model to infer the effects of NPIs on the reduction in instantaneous reproduction number (\\({R}_{t}\\)) (see Fig. 5). In this study, \\({R}_{t}\\) was estimated by a Bayesian framework68 (see supplementary section B for more details). For a robust, localized estimation, we assumed that the effectiveness of the individual NPI was relatively stable in each outbreak regarding the same variant and location. The effectiveness of each NPI was evaluated by estimating how much of the variation in NPI intensity could account for the reduction in \\({R}_{t}\\). Specifically, a generalized linear relationship between NPI intensity and the reduction was considered below. The relationship between each individual NPI and effect on the reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) was assumed to be linear. This assumption was incorporated into a hierarchical model, where varying slopes were used for each variant. Non-informative priors with a Gamma distribution were included in the model consistent with methodology employed by Yong et al. and others20,24,30,69.\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v}={R}_{0,v}\\mathop{\\prod }\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{{\\exp }}\\left(-{\\alpha }_{i,v}{X}_{i,t,v}-{\\beta }_{i}{T}_{i,t,v}\\right)+\\varepsilon 1$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\varPhi }_{t,v} \\sim {gamma}({R}_{t,v},{\\sigma }_{t,v})$$\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \\({X}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates each individual NPI \\(i\\) under variant \\(v\\) on day \\(t\\). n represents the number of NPIs. \\({T}_{i,t,v}\\) indicates the control variable, i.e., air temperature, population density and practical vaccination rate used in this study. \\({\\alpha }_{i,v}\\) represents the coefficient of the covariate \\(X\\) across different variants v. Following the assumption by Flaxman et al.14, the NPI coefficients are assigned a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1/6 and scale parameter 1 and further shifted by log (1.05)/6 to accommodate for both positive and negative effects, see supplementary Fig 5. \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) represents the coefficient of the control variable. We placed it a Normal prior with a coefficient of \\(N(0,\\,0.5)\\), indicating \\({\\beta }_{i}\\) might also be associated with the trajectory but remains constant across all variants. The contribution of other unobserved confounding factors to the \\({R}_{t}\\) decay is indicated by the residual \\(\\varepsilon\\). We set the prior of the basic reproduction number \\({R}_{0,v}\\) to obey a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of \\(f\\) and a rate parameter of 0.1, where f varied with SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see supplementary Table 5). \\({\\sigma }_{t,v}\\) indicates the variance of \\({R}_{t,v}\\), which was estimated by the observed cases data on a daily basis for each study outbreak. Note that each NPI has been normalized to 0−1. The details of pre-processing NPIs can be found in supplementary method A.2 and supplementary Equation Table (https://github.com/wxl1379457192/Zeroing_out_emerging_contagions/blob/main/Supplementary_equation_table.doc).\n\nFinally, we estimated the effectiveness of each NPI group under each variant using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with Rstan70. We ran 5 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations with 5000 iterations for warmup and a thinning factor of two to obtain 12,500 posterior samples. And the effect of NPIs can be computed by \\(1-{{\\exp }}(-{\\sum }_{i}^{n}{\\alpha }_{i,v}\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}})\\), which \\(\\overline{{X}_{i,t,v}}\\) represents the median intensity of each individual NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) for variant \\(v\\). \\(n\\) represents the number of NPIs in each category. The median value of NPI intensity was calculated based on the normalized NPI. The NPIs effect was defined as the percentage reduction of \\({R}_{t}\\) relative to \\({R}_{0}\\) with its highest value of 1, representing the outbreak has been fully contained. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used to validate our model (see supplementary Section B). We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of model parameter assumptions (see supplementary Section E).\n\nReconstructing and simulating transmission under varying scenarios\n\nCompartmental model\n\nThe classic SEIR model divides the whole population into four components, including the susceptible (\\(S\\)) population which can be infected, the exposed (\\(E\\)) population which has been infected but not yet be infectious, the infectious (\\(I\\)) population who can infect the susceptible, and the recovered or removed (\\(R\\)) population which cannot be infected or spread pathogens to other people. We modified the classic SEIR model into Intervention-SEIR-vaccination model (ISEIRV) to account for the impact of NPIs implementation and large-scale vaccination:\n\n$$N=S(0)+E(0)+I(0)+R(0)$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$S(t+1)=S(t)-\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(4)\n\n$$E(t+1)=E(t)+\\frac{\\beta (t)(1-c(t))I(t)S(t)}{N}-\\lambda E(t)$$\n\n(5)\n\n$$I(t+1)=I(t)+\\lambda E(t)-r(t)I(t)$$\n\n(6)\n\n$$R(t+1)=R(t)+r(t)I(t)+v(t)S(t)$$\n\n(7)\n\nAs vaccines have been used to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the middle of our study time period, we added an additional term \\(v(t)S(t)\\) in the dynamics of the susceptible population, where \\(v(t)\\) is the daily practical vaccination rate transferring the susceptible population to the virtually recovered population with vaccine-introduced immunity. Given the short period of simulations for each outbreak, the overall low efficacy of vaccines to prevent infections, and the fact that the majority of populations have not been infected, the decline in immunity during the outbreaks was not considered. \\(\\lambda\\) is the inverse of the latent period representing the transfer rate from the exposed population to the infectious population, i.e., the time lag between being infected and being infectious.\n\nThe transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) between the susceptible and the infectious populations was designed as a function of time to reflect the impact of NPI implementation. That is,\n\n$$\\beta (t)={b}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{b}_{1}{x}_{1}(t))*(1-0.25{x}_{2}(t))$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\({b}_{0}\\) is the baseline of the transmission rate without any interventions, \\({x}_{1}\\) is the integrated measure of the strengths for the contact reduction aimed NPIs, and \\({x}_{2}\\) is the fraction of the population that complied with the requirement to wear a mask. Efficiency of facial masking for preventing indoor transmission was set as 25%71. The general measure of contact reduction was calculated by NPIs including (1) stay-at-home order, (2) business premises closure, (3) public transportation closure, (4) gathering restriction, (5) workplace closure, and (6) school closure. The intensity of the general contact-reduction measure was then defined by the linear combination of the intensities of relevant NPIs on a daily basis:\n\n$${x}_{1}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{6}{w}_{i}*{X}_{i}$$\n\n(9)\n\n$${w}_{i}=\\frac{{e}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{6}{e}_{i}}$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the weights \\({w}_{i}\\) for each NPI \\({X}_{i}\\) was proportionally determined by its empirical \\({e}_{i}\\) of reducing \\({R}_{t}\\) assessed by the Bayesian inference model. Next, the dynamic transmission rate was further adjusted by the contact tracing rate \\(c(t)\\), which measures the daily ratio of cases identified among close contacts in isolation to all cases reported.\n\nThe detection and quarantine of infectious populations could reduce the probability of transmission. Therefore, we also modified the recovery/removed rate \\(r\\), to account for the implementation of mass testing, which moves infectious people into the compartment R. In specific, \\(r\\) was modeled as\n\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))}{1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))}11$$\n\nwhere \\({r}_{0}\\) is the infectious period for omicron72, and \\({x}_{3}\\) is the intensity of mass screening. For pre-Delta and Delta periods, we adjusted \\({r}_{0}\\) as 7 and 6, respectively. The term, \\(1/({r}_{0}{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{1}{x}_{3}(t)))\\), indicates the expectation of the virtual recovery rate. Considering the policy lag and process of large-scale mass screening, the recovery rate was adjusted in the shape of logistic function by dividing \\(1+{{\\exp }}(-{r}_{2}(t-{r}_{3}))\\). \\({r}_{1},{r}_{2}\\) and \\({r}_{3}\\) are underestimated model coefficients. More details on parameter calibration and model validation for ISEIRV can be found in the supplementary method.\n\nScenario analysis of zeroing strategies\n\nTo reveal the effects and challenges of NPIs and intervention timings on zeroing out emerging contagions under different scenarios, we further simulate the spread of emerging respiratory viral infections in cities with varying population sizes (<5 million, 5–10 million, and over 10 million residents) (See supplementary Table 7). We simulated the epidemiological trajectory of the spread of the virus within each city using ISEIRV model in MATLAB version R2022a, under 1800 scenarios (4 NPIs × 10 intensities × 5 time-points × 9 epidemiological parameter schemes) including nine combined transmission settings (set \\({R}_{0}\\) = 3, 8, 13, and incubation period (\\({I}_{t}\\)) = 1, 4, 7 days, respectively). The simulations focus on the time-point and the intensity to implement NPIs, including social distancing measures (SD), facial masking (FM), PCR screening (PCR), and Contact tracing (CT). Effects of the implementation of independent and combined NPI were also assessed (see our supplementary Section D for details).

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/news-release/2022/areaemployment_chicago_20220930.htm', 'Headline': 'Chicago Area Employment - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Snippet': 'Total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI, metropolitan area increased by 201,200 over the year in August. ...

(All data in this release are not seasonally adjusted; accordingly, over-the-year analysis is used throughout.)\n\nChicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI, is made up of four metropolitan divisions—separately identifiable employment centers within the greater metropolitan area. Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights, IL, with 80 percent of the metropolitan area’s total nonfarm employment, gained 172,600 jobs over the year. Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI (9 percent of the area’s employment), gained 14,500 jobs and employment in Elgin, IL (5 percent of the area’s employment), rose by 7,900 jobs.

The metropolitan area’s trade, transportation, and utilities supersector had a 4.2-percent annual gain in employment compared to the 3.6-percent increase nationally.\n\nEducation and health services gained 18,100 jobs over the year, an increase of 2.6 percent. Nationwide, education and health services employment rose 3.3 percent.\n\nTwo other supersectors in the metropolitan area had over-the-year job gains in August: manufacturing (+13,900) and construction (+9,700).\n\nTwelve largest metropolitan areas\n\nChicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI, was 1 of the nation’s 12 largest metropolitan statistical areas in August 2022. All 12 areas gained jobs over the year. New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA, had the largest increase (+497,800). Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV, had the smallest increase (+73,800) among the largest areas, followed by Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ (+87,100). (See table 2 and chart 3.)\n\nDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, had a 6.7-percent rate of job gain, followed by Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX (+6.2 percent). The rates of job gain in the remaining 10 areas ranged from 5.7 percent in Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL, to 2.3 percent in Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV.\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for September 2022 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, November 2, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. (ET).\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThis release presents nonfarm payroll employment estimates from the CES program. The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to decrease volatility in estimation.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available online at https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/benchmark.htm.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Measures of sampling error for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions at www.bls.gov/web/laus/790stderr.htm.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018.

However, prosecutors later dropped the charges against her.\n\nBabbitt was killed during the Capitol riot, where she was seen wearing a Donald Trump flag as a cape. She was attempting to crawl through a broken window in the interior of the Capitol where lawmakers were still present in the Speaker’s Lobby. Although Capitol police officers warned the rioters to stay out, they continued to push inside.\n\nA Capitol police officer fired a shot at her while she was midway through a window, hitting her neck; she later died at a Washington DC hospital from the gunshot wound.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps on the riot’s anniversary to claim that her daughter was exercising her right to protest ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was killed by a US Capitol police officer one year ago.\n\n“My daughter was an amazing, energetic, independent, powerful woman. I miss her every day,” Micki Witthoeft said through tears as members of Congress gathered inside to remember the first anniversary of the attacks.\n\n“I’m here because Americans do have the right to protest, it’s your right as an American citizen to protest,” she continued.\n\nBabbitt, a 36-year-old Air Force veteran, was shot by US Capitol Police officer Lt. Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process. Most of them veterans, who fought for their right to be in this country, to exercise their First Amendment right to protest — and they are being denied the rights they fought for,” she said.\n\nAs Congress marked the anniversary with a moment of silence and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered speeches, a few supporters of the Jan. 6 effort gathered nearby.\n\nKeith Scott, who described himself as a proud Capitol rioter, traveled to DC from Corpus Christi, Texas, to observe the anniversary.\n\n“It was the greatest day of my life,” he said as he stood near the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the base of Capitol Hill.\n\n“I felt like a patriot – like a patriot before the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and I still feel that way.”\n\nBut he said he was disappointed the anniversary didn’t draw other supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n“Loyal Trump supporters are worn out,” he said.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/ashli-babbitt-a-martyr-her-past-tells-a-more-complex-story/2829546/', 'Headline': 'Ashli Babbitt a Martyr?

How long the investigation has been underway, its status, and its scope, are not clear. Mayes, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the investigation on Wednesday.\n\n""We are taking this investigation very seriously, very solemnly,"" Mayes told local media this week, adding ""we\'re going to do it on our timetable as justice demands.""\n\nThe Arizona probe takes place as Trump and 18 of his associates face charges of racketeering, election fraud and other charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over an alleged effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including the alternate elector scheme. The indictment alleged that some of the defendants solicited legislators to appoint new electors not only in Georgia, but also in states including Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nLast week, the former president was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That indictment cited a memo outlining a strategy for Trump supporters to serve as fake electors.\n\nNewly unveiled memo cited in Trump indictment detailed false electors scheme\n\nThe former president has denied all wrongdoing in both of those cases. He has been charged in two other cases. One involves federal counts related to alleged mishandling of classified documents. The other, in state court in New York, involves allegedly falsifying business records. He has denied wrongdoing in those cases as well.\n\nLast year, Mayes narrowly defeated a Republican who denied the 2020 presidential election results. Mayes pledged to investigate the alleged fake electors scheme.\n\nMultiple GOP candidates in Arizona, a longtime swing state, who ran in 2022 insisted that President Biden did not rightfully win the 2020 election.

Such collaborations can lead to scientific advancements, but there are concerns about certain countries exploiting this research to harm the U.S.\n\nWe reviewed federal funds that agencies directly or indirectly awarded to 3 Chinese research institutions. Most of the money came from awards funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nNIH's oversight didn't always ensure that foreign institutions complied with award terms and conditions—which can include biosafety requirements.\n\nWe recommended improving oversight of such awards.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nAll three of the selected Chinese entities GAO was asked to provide information on, received research funds in calendar years 2014 through 2021, whether directly through a federal award or indirectly through subawards to carry out part of the work of a federal award. Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency. However, all three selected entities collectively received seven subawards, totaling over $2 million, from federal award recipients or a first-tier subrecipient (see figure).\n\nAwards and Subawards Identified to Three Selected Chinese Entities, Calendar Years 2014-2021\n\nNote: The figure may not reflect all funding to the selected entities in the time period reviewed due, in part, to limitations in federal reporting requirements.\n\nFederal agencies and award recipients described efforts to assess risks, but gaps exist in NIH's risk assessment efforts. In January 2023, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommended that NIH implement enhanced monitoring, documentation, and reporting requirements for award recipients with foreign subrecipients. To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients.

However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal continue to impede the effectiveness of these interventions3,4. Drivers of vaccine hesitancy are context-specific and include lower education, mistrust in science and governments5,6,7 and misinformation8,9. Around two-thirds (66.4%) of the world’s population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of 30 June 2022, but only 17.4% of people in low-income countries had received a first dose10, underscoring unequal access, availability and delivery11,12.\n\nGlobal rates of COVID-19 vaccination are gradually improving, albeit unevenly. Moreover, evidence suggests that the humoral response to vaccination is substantially reduced within 6 months13, necessitating additional doses (that is, boosters) to achieve adequate levels of protection14.\n\nVaccine hesitancy is a complex phenomenon15; prior studies of influenza vaccine hesitancy have identified more than 70 factors that influence it, many of which are time-specific and context-specific16. Not surprisingly, the same factors that influence hesitancy to accept an initial COVID-19 dose also drive booster hesitancy: mistrust of government and health authorities, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy and, in some countries, age and minority race or ethnicity5,6,17. The limited efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection against new circulating variants could also influence acceptance18. Twice-yearly COVID-19 booster vaccinations are currently recommended in some countries based on eligibility and availability, and vaccines effective against new variants are in development19. Introducing updated vaccine formulations and frequent booster shots will intensify the challenge of convincing individuals and communities to accept new vaccines to maintain protective immunity, particularly as the risk perception of COVID-19 infection has decreased20.\n\nSome obstacles to effective vaccine science communication for lay audiences may include the need to continuously disseminate new safety and efficacy data in simple, understandable terms; to explain the justification for newly authorized or reformulated products; and to introduce changes in vaccination schedules, especially for new or expanded authorizations of childhood vaccinations21. Failure to convey this information clearly and consistently during the current pandemic may have confused audiences, eroded confidence in the science and reduced vaccine acceptance. The ongoing ‘infodemic’ of voluminous, high-speed information—accurate or not—further impedes vaccine literacy22.\n\nVaccination acceptance may also be dampened by public perceptions that new COVID-19 variants are possibly less severe23 or that recently authorized therapeutics may improve disease outcomes well enough to obviate the need to vaccinate in the first place24. Unfortunately, the emergence of highly infectious variants and the relaxation of public health and social containment measures in many countries will almost certainly trigger increased community transmission25.\n\nThe aim of this large survey in 23 populous and heavily impacted countries, representing almost 60% of the world’s population26, was to track trends in global vaccine acceptance, to profile attitudes toward recently available COVID-19 boosters and pharmaceutical treatments and to assess attitudes toward several previously studied variables that appear to contribute to ongoing vaccine hesitancy at a critical time in the natural history of the pandemic.\n\nThe global sample of 23,000 respondents included 1,000 participants from each of 23 countries surveyed (Brazil, Canada, China, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States) (Methods). Half of respondents (50.3%) were women, and one-fifth of respondents (22.2%) had a university degree. Age groups (18–29; 30–39; 40–49; 50–59; and 60+) were approximately equally represented (16.8–22.9%). Nearly half of all respondents reported income above their country’s median (45.6%). Healthcare workers (HCWs) represented one in ten (10.8%) of all respondents (Extended Data Table 1).\n\nVaccine acceptance in 2022 was reported by 79.1% of the respondents, up from 75.2% 1 year earlier6. However, vaccine hesitancy increased in eight countries (range 1.0% in UK to 21.1% in South Africa) (Fig. 1). Booster hesitancy among those vaccinated was 12.1% (range 1.1% in China to 28.9% in Russia) (Fig. 2).\n\nIn total, 36.6% of all respondents reported COVID-19 illness (oneself or one’s family) within the past year (range 0.8% in Nigeria to 60.9% in Singapore), and 24% reported receiving treatment with pharmaceuticals (range 6.2% in Germany to 68.9% in Ghana). Medications reported as having been used included monoclonal antibodies (olumiant/baricitinib) (27.2%), ivermectin (27%), Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) (25.8%) and molnupiravir (lagevrio) (20%) (Fig. 3).\n\nVaccine hesitancy was significantly more likely to be associated with males in Nigeria and Peru (adjusted odds ratio (aOR = 4.42–5.24)) and females in China, Poland and Russia (aOR = 0.06–0.67) and not having a university degree in France, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and the United States (aOR = 0.15–0.60) (Table 1). Vaccine hesitancy was not universally associated with income distribution, as it was significantly higher among respondents earning less than their country’s median income in the United States (aOR = 2.35) and conversely higher among those earning more than the median income in Ecuador and Ghana (aOR = 0.07–0.13) (Table 1). Belief in a vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19 and in vaccine safety and trust in vaccine science remained strongly correlated with acceptance (Extended Data Table 7). Booster hesitancy among vaccinated respondents was significantly associated with younger age in France, Germany, Poland, South Korea, Spain and Sweden (aOR = 0.96–0.98) and with older age in Ecuador (aOR = 1.09); with male respondents in Ecuador (aOR = 5.69) and with female respondents in France and the United States (aOR = 0.53−0.57); with not having a university degree in Italy and South Africa (aOR = 0.28–0.52); and with earning less than the country’s median income in Canada, Germany, Turkey and the United Kingdom (aOR = 1.81–11.14) (Table 1).\n\nParental willingness to vaccinate their children in the 23 countries studied increased slightly from 67.6% in 2021 (ref. 6), when COVID-19 vaccines for children were awaiting regulatory approval, to 69.5% in 2022. Over the past year, moreover, COVID-19 childhood vaccine hesitancy increased in eight countries (ranging from a 2.4% increase in Poland to 56.3% in Brazil) and remained greatest among parents who themselves were hesitant (Fig. 4). Childhood COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was also significantly higher among older parents in Ecuador, India and South Africa (aOR = 1.03–1.19), among male respondents in Ecuador, Mexico and Peru (aOR = 3.41–5.33) and among respondents with less than the median national income in Canada, France, Germany and the United States (aOR = 1.86–2.96) (Table 1).\n\nSupport for COVID-19 vaccination mandates in 2021 ranged from 58.4% for vaccination of children to attend school to 74.4% for proof of vaccination for international travel6. Support for all vaccination mandates in the 2022 survey decreased compared to findings in our survey from the previous year, ranging from −2.6% for employers to require vaccination to −6.9% for proof of vaccination for international travel, although support for the latter remained strong (69.2%). Support for mandates to vaccinate children to attend school, for adults to attend university and indoor activities and for governments or employers to require vaccination decreased in most countries (Fig. 5). However, support for government mandates did increase in 11 of the 23 countries (range 0.2% in Canada to 14.8% in Poland) (Fig. 5).\n\nVaccine hesitancy among HCWs decreased from 8.1% in 2021 to 4.6% in 2022 but was significantly lower than for non-HCWs (4.6% versus 9.4%, aOR = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.53, 0.78), P < 0.001)6. Receipt of at least one booster dose was reported by 19.9% of HCWs compared to 40.3% of non-HCWs. Booster hesitancy among vaccinated HCWs was lower (9.7%) compared to 12.4% of non-HCWs (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI (0.71, 0.88), P < 0.001). Booster hesitancy was lowest among physicians (2.7%) and followed by nurses (9.9%), community health workers (10.4%) and other HCWs (16.3%) (Extended Data Table 2).\n\nAlmost two in five (38.6%) of all respondents said they now pay less attention to new information about COVID-19 vaccines than 1 year ago (range 7.5% in India to 58.3% in Nigeria). Nonetheless, two-thirds of all respondents (66.6%) still prefer vaccination to prevent COVID-19 illness (range 40% in South Africa to 91.4% in China). In total, 16.2% of respondents preferred treating the disease with medication (range 2.8% in China to 31.2% in South Africa), and 53.2% believe that the vaccines can protect people from Long COVID (range 28.3% in Russia to 79.7% in India), but one-quarter (25.2%) of respondents indicated that they are now less likely to get vaccinated due to perceived lesser disease severity (range 4.2% in China to 43.1% in South Korea) (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Tables 3–7).\n\nIn the light of continued surges of COVID-19, policymakers around the world must decisively address vaccine hesitancy and resistance as a component of their overall prevention and mitigation strategy. This study provides international COVID-19 vaccine acceptance data over 3 years and found that acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination in 23 countries was 79.1% in 2022, an increase from 75.2% in 2021 (ref. 6). However, in our survey, 12% of those already vaccinated were hesitant or reported refusal to receive a booster dose.\n\nAmong social and demographic determinants, our findings indicate that booster hesitancy is higher at younger ages27,28,29, unlike some previous studies that reported greater booster hesitancy among older persons30. Our findings of greater hesitancy among those with lower educational attainment31 and lower income17 are consistent with the literature and unchanged from our previous reports5,6. Similarly, our booster coverage ranges align with the existing literature—for example, from 7% in China32 to more than 40% in Jordan33, Malaysia30 and the United States31. These rates were included in country-specific reports using different data sources, methodologies and chronology, whereas ours are reported on 23 countries simultaneously using a standardized method of data collection and analysis.\n\nOur findings also corroborate previous literature showing greater hesitancy among those reporting concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, low trust in government31,34 and the perception that COVID-19 is a low risk35. Despite overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines36, these concerns persist for vaccine boosters29,37, which may present a serious challenge to anticipated routine COVID-19 immunization programs. The lowest vaccination rates identified in our results are also bimodal; they exist outside of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and, therefore, cannot be explained by lack of access alone. Public health strategies to enhance coverage will need to differ, sometimes radically, in different settings.\n\nParental hesitancy to vaccinate children younger than 18 years remained high in many high-income countries, including France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Korea, as well as some LMICs, such as Kenya and Nigeria. Key variables were low perception of vaccine safety38,39 and younger parental age, which might represent potentially less-experienced parenting40,41, as well as parents who themselves had not been vaccinated38. Interventions to improve parental intention to vaccinate their children include counseling or motivational interviewing by pediatricians or other healthcare providers, as well as narrative framing that presents the statistics on safety of these vaccines for the millions of children already vaccinated39. Further efforts to make the vaccine more accessible to children in LMICs will also be required.\n\nOur findings also report on receipt of therapeutics for COVID-19 globally and compare respondent preference for medicinal treatment versus prevention with vaccines. Our respondents reported the use of ivermectin as frequently as the use of approved medications and products, despite the fact that ivermectin is not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading agencies to prevent or treat COVID-19 (ref. 42). Respondents who reported ivermectin use tended to reside in LMICs43. Further efforts will be required to discourage the use of ivermectin and other pharmaceuticals with no proven efficacy and potential toxicity.\n\nTo varying degrees, most respondents in our study support the use of mandates to contain COVID-19 in indoor spaces, the workplace, schools and universities and during international travel, although this support declined from the previous year6. Although vaccine mandates have shown effectiveness in improving coverage in some regions—for example, the United States44 and Europe45,46—their future use, particularly among populations with high rates of vaccination, will require a careful balance between the need for community protection and the need to maintain public support and voluntary compliance. Communicating the rationale for instituting or reinstituting mandates for vaccination along with promoting vaccine literacy relative to preventive behaviors, such as face-masking and physical distancing, must improve, including the clarification of criteria for their relaxation or cessation.\n\nIt is well established and intuitively logical that frequent exposure to misinformation increases vaccine hesitancy8,47. Misrepresentation of COVID-19 vaccines on social media most commonly includes misinformation about the medical/health benefits, false content about vaccine development and conspiracy theories48. Those living in less developed countries may be more susceptible to misinformation49, yet, to date, research investigating online COVID-19 misinformation has been conducted primarily in high-income countries48,50, highlighting the need for similar research in LMICs, particularly those with high vaccine hesitancy and improved or improving access to vaccines40, to increase uptake.\n\nIntentional or not, misrepresentation and misinformation can derail progress in COVID-19 vaccination coverage, particularly if audiences choose not to seek COVID-19 information from official sources, such as WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or medical professional associations. These high-credibility sources of information face the additional challenges of pandemic fatigue41—or distress that may demotivate one to follow recommended protective behaviors—and, among some communities, low trust toward such institutions5,6,7,34,51. The characteristics of people who currently pay less attention to COVID-19 vaccine information than 1 year ago vary by country, highlighting the importance of tailored health communication techniques (Extended Data Table 3). As the pandemic continues, as new variants emerge and as public compliance with public health and social measures wanes, it is clear that those responsible for public health programs will need to develop more effective, personalized and sophisticated strategies to regain public attention and rebuild trust52. Such programs must also be designed to include monitoring and, where appropriate, to address misinformation, as well as to develop and test other novel, effective communication methods. Current efforts to fact-check online COVID-19 information have not kept pace with the ability of misinformation to reduce vaccine acceptance49.\n\nOur findings may offer insight to policymakers and public health officials regarding message content and targeting. Strategies to improve vaccine literacy could include messages that emphasize compassion over fear53, message framing based on audience demographics and psychographics54 as well as the use of trusted messengers55, particularly healthcare providers56,57, and various types of incentives58. Frequency, content and channels of dissemination are key factors in message transmission and receipt. Public health communicators should regularly test messages and the source (messenger) for optimal reach and uptake59 and integrate vaccine literacy strategies using qualitative formative research, such as focus groups among target audiences60, to assess content on current (for example, first-dose and booster vaccination) and emerging (for example, mitigation of Long COVID) issues61.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, our questionnaire asked about a general COVID-19 vaccine, whereas several COVID-19 vaccines, each with different efficacy results, are now being distributed globally. Next, although this study used state-of-the-art sampling methodology that aimed to achieve population representativeness, these samples may not adequately represent the most vulnerable segments of populations, including those with limited access to online technology, as they would be less likely to participate in research of this type. Additionally, we note that definitions for vaccine hesitancy do vary in the literature. We chose to categorize our data according to the 2014 Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) definition15 rather than using the SAGE-endorsed Behavioral and Social Drivers (BeSD)62 framing, which does not recognize the critical role of politics and/or political allegiance and orchestrated anti-vaccine networks/disrupters, all of which are critical issues influencing vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, although the BeSD framing acknowledges respect ‘from’ HCWs, it does not focus on the importance of mutual respect, despite the increases in aggression toward HCWs and scientists. The earlier WHO SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy defines vaccine hesitancy as ‘the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services’, which we thought could be captured in our dataset and compared to prior years (as described in the Methods) in a way that the full model of BeSD could not. Although the choice to use the 2014 SAGE definition is a limitation in that it does not fully reflect the most contemporary literature at the time of publication, we note that it still permits comparative analysis of factors included in both models, such as complacency, convenience and confidence factors. Finally, this study was based on cross-sectional data; thus, study results cannot be interpreted causally.\n\nThe most promising finding of the 2022 global survey is that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has continued to rise in most countries studied, reaching 79.1% overall. However, the wide variability of acceptance rates that we report could jeopardize efforts to control the pandemic. Our findings also show that, although most respondents accept booster shots and childhood vaccination, some unvaccinated individuals remain intractably opposed to immunizing themselves and their children. Decisionmakers, practitioners, advocates and researchers must collaborate more effectively to address these lingering disparities and pockets of resistance with novel, tailored, evidence-based policies and programs. To reverse trends of complacency and end the COVID-19 pandemic as a global public health threat, pandemic responses must include efforts to build trust and change the behaviors of unvaccinated, undervaccinated and indifferent people.\n\nStudy design and data collection\n\nThis cross-sectional study used random stratified sampling, with strata established for age, gender, statistical regions and country-specific levels of education63,64,65,66,67. A minimum of 50 participants was set for each stratum, with target enrollment calculated to reflect the distribution of each subgroup in the general population68,69. Consensus Strategies recruited participants from international online panel providers using multiple panels to reduce coverage bias. Details on variable coding and weighting for strata and participant recruitment methods are described elsewhere5,6. Survey data were collected between 29 June and 10 July 2022 from 23,000 respondents aged ≥18 years from 23 countries: Brazil, Canada, China, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries were selected based on a combination of their impact on morbidity and mortality in 2020 and the desire to achieve strong regional representation6. This study was approved and the survey administered by Emerson College (institutional review board protocol no. 20-023-F-E-6/12-[R1], updated on 12 April 2021). No personally identifiable information was collected or stored. Informed consent was obtained on the information page before participants proceeded to the survey.\n\nSurvey instrument\n\nThe instrument was developed by an expert panel after a comprehensive literature review of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy literature, as described in other studies5,6,70,71. The 30-question instrument (Supplementary Information 1) included questions regarding: (1) perceptions of risk, efficacy, safety and trust; (2) identification of vaccine acceptance or hesitancy, defined according to the WHO SAGE description15, which continues to evolve62,72,73,74, and coded based on Likert responses to questions regarding receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or willingness to take a vaccine when it became available. Vaccine hesitancy was coded both for individual respondents and separately for respondents with children under 18 years of age; (3) booster acceptance and hesitancy-defining questions included receipt of at least one booster dose or willingness to take a booster when it becomes available, with booster hesitancy coded in the same way as vaccine hesitancy; (4) medication use when sick with COVID-19 within the past year; (5) support for COVID-19 vaccine mandates required (a) by employers and (b) by the government, for (c) university students, (d) for school children, (e) for attending indoor activities, such as programs in auditoriums, concerts or sports events, and (f) for international travel; (6) level of attention paid to new information about (a) COVID-19 vaccines compared to 1 year ago; (b) preference for illness prevention through vaccination versus treatment with medications after infection; (c) belief about vaccination protection against Long COVID; and (d) likelihood of vaccination in light of currently perceived disease severity; (7) COVID-19 experience (whether oneself or a family member became ill with COVID-19 within the past year or more than 1 year ago); and (8) demographic variables (that is, age, gender, education, income and HCW status).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to report vaccine hesitancy, booster hesitancy and hesitancy among parents regarding vaccination of their children, by country and across the 23-country sample, including the rate of change from 2020–2022. Socio-demographic factors associated with hesitancy were examined through weighted multivariable logistic regressions and reported as ORs and associated 95% CIs. Associations between beliefs in a vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19, vaccine safety and trust in vaccine science with vaccine acceptance were examined using weighted univariate logistic regressions. We report descriptive statistics and the rate of change from 2021–2022 regarding requirements for proof of vaccination to travel internationally or to attend work, school or indoor events. Finally, we report descriptive statistics on medication used when sick with COVID-19 within the past year, attention to new information about COVID-19 vaccines compared to 1 year ago, preference for illness prevention (vaccination versus medication treatment), belief about vaccination as protection against Long COVID and likelihood of vaccination considering current perceived disease severity. All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4 software, and significance was set at α = 0.05.\n\nEthics and inclusion statement\n\nData for this study, including from LMICs, were collected via online panels by an international polling agency, Consensus Strategies. One colleague (A.K.) is from an LMIC, and three others (A.E.-M., C.A.P. and K.W.) are originally from LMICs and are now based in high-income countries. We fully endorse the Nature Portfolio journals’ guidance on LMIC authorship and inclusion. As this was the third annual iteration of this work, authorship was based, in part, on prior participation. However, we are strongly committed to the inclusion of more researchers from LMICs in future iterations.\n\nThis research is locally relevant to all studied countries given that it disaggregates findings by country and, thus, provides local decisionmakers with socio-demographic data relative to several outcomes of interest, such as vaccine or booster hesitancy. The authors chose to focus on these variables based on the previous iterations of this study, which have been widely cited by researchers in LMICs, and evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.\n\nAs our methodology employed online data collection panels for each country and was approved by Emerson College, additional local review was not required. This research was not restricted and originated in three of the countries (Spain, United States and the United Kingdom) that are current settings for the researchers. The data collection and analysis techniques employed raised no risks pertaining to stigmatization, incrimination, discrimination, animal welfare, the environment, health, safety, security or other personal risks. No biological materials, cultural artifacts or associated traditional knowledge has been transferred out of any country. In preparing the manuscript, the authors reviewed relevant studies from each of the 23 countries.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/12/30/1068920127/the-goal-at-least-40-vaxxed-in-all-nations-by-year-end-this-map-shows-how-we-sta', 'Headline': 'World map shows which nations met 40% vaccine goal - NPR', 'Snippet': ""World map shows which nations met 40% vaccine goal — and which didn't : Goats and Soda The program called COVAX was set up to make sure that all countries have access to COVID vaccines.

The ...', 'Full_text': ""The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.\n\nThe 2022 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report presents updates on the food security and nutrition situation around the world, including the latest estimates of the cost and affordability of a healthy diet. The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/food-insecurity-in-the-time-of-covid', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity in the Time of COVID - Johns Hopkins', 'Snippet': 'Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted food supplies, health systems, and global nutrition programs, 800 million around the world were undernourished (supplied with less than the minimum amount of the nutrients or foods essential for sound health and growth).

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2023/22_0212.htm', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity Trajectories in the US During the First Year of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Food insecurity trajectories.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years.

Flawed research by a former British spy tasked with a sensitive, and political, assignment. And an FBI scrambling against the election-season clock to untangle suspicions about foreign government collusion that it feared could have grave national security implications.\n\nA 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.\n\nThe findings aren’t flattering for the FBI, with Durham asserting that it rushed into the investigation without an adequate basis and routinely ignored or rationalized evidence that undercut its premise. The report catalogs a series of errors — though many were already documented years ago by a separate Justice Department inspector general report, and the FBI says it’s taken several dozen corrective steps on its own.\n\nA look at some of the major findings of the Durham report.\n\nA ‘SERIOUSLY FLAWED’ INVESTIGATION\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the FBI’s decision to open, on July 31, 2016, an investigation into possible criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe probe was initiated after it learned from an Australian diplomat that a Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos had claimed to know that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. By that point, it was well known that Russian operatives had hacked Democratic emails, and Trump had even appeared to publicly invite Moscow to go looking for Clinton’s communications.\n\nBut, according to Durham, the FBI rushed into the probe without having any evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign had had any contact with any Russian intelligence officers. It identifies by name the Russia experts in the FBI and other agencies who were never consulted before the investigation was begun and says that had they been, they would have said there was no information pointing to a conspiracy between Russia and the campaign.\n\nThe report contends that the FBI fell prone to “confirmation bias,” repeatedly ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing away evidence that undercut the premise of collusion, including a conversation in which Papadopoulos vigorously denied knowing about any cooperative relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt also says investigators did not corroborate a “single substantive allegation” in a dossier of Democratic-funded research that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and yet continued to cite it in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.\n\nBUT DID IT UNCOVER ‘THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY’ AS TRUMP PREDICTED?\n\nNo, it did not. Despite identifying abundant errors, the report and the broader investigation failed to live up to Trump’s hype. The former president claimed that it would reveal the “crime of the century” and expose a “deep state conspiracy” by high-ranking government officials to derail his candidacy and later his presidency.\n\nBut the report yielded only one conviction — a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee — and the only two other cases that were brought both ended in acquittals at trial. And though Durham accused the FBI of confirmation bias, he did not allege that political bias or partisanship were guiding factors for the FBI’s actions.\n\n‘RIGOR, OBJECTIVITY AND PROFESSIONALISM’\n\nThe FBI responded to criticism of its actions by noting that the conduct occurred under different FBI leadership, months before current Director Christopher Wray took the top job. It also said it had already taken dozens of corrective measures designed to prevent the same problems from recurring.\n\nThose include steps designed to ensure the accuracy of applications the FBI files with the secretive surveillance court when it wants to eavesdrop on the communications of suspected spies and terrorists. For instance, the FBI said, agents must now provide more information, including identifying and disclosing evidence that might undercut their premise that probable cause exists for surveillance. In addition, the FBI has worked to improve oversight of confidential human sources.\n\nThe FBI said in a letter to Durham that it was confident that had those steps been in place in 2016, the “failures detailed in your Report never would have happened.” In a separate statement, it said the report “reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.“\n\nWAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TREATED DIFFERENTLY?\n\nYes, Durham argues. He notes that the FBI in 2016 also investigated allegations in the book “Clinton Cash,” authored by a conservative writer who alleged foreign governments were funneling money to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for access. Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and former President Bill Clinton have long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI labeled its reviews linked to “Clinton Cash” as “preliminary investigations,” Durham said. But the Trump Russia probe, he said, “was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information.”\n\nHe argues the FBI showed caution about possibly influencing Hillary Clinton’s campaign that it did not show for Trump’s campaign.\n\nTo underscore his point, he quotes some of the text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose privately expressed dislike for Trump has long been cited as evidence of bias.\n\n“One more thing: (Clinton) may be our next president,” Page is said to have written Strzok. “The last thing you need (is) going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”\n\nAN UPHILL CLIMB IN CONGRESS GETS STEEPER\n\nThe Durham report is another blow to the FBI as it’s trying to persuade Congress that it is a responsible steward of intelligence.\n\nLawmakers are beginning to debate whether to renew a U.S. surveillance program that captures huge swaths of foreigners’ emails and phone calls. The program authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Durham report calls attention to mistakes that Republicans have already cited as reasons for overhauling Section 702. The FBI did not use Section 702 in surveilling Page. But its omissions before the primary surveillance court have long rankled Republicans, who have signaled they won’t renew Section 702 without changes targeting the FBI.\n\n“It is essential that Congress codifies clear guardrails that prevent future FBI abuses and restores the public’s trust in our law enforcement institutions,” said Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement.\n\nA significant number of Democrats, meanwhile, separately want limits on when the FBI can search foreign surveillance data collected under Section 702.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/may/17/durham-report-criticized-elements-of-fbis-investig/', 'Headline': 'Durham’s report on the Trump-Russia probes, explained', 'Snippet': 'Mueller’s report reaffirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it did not find that the Kremlin’s acts on Trump’s behalf ...'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-russia-probe-durham-report/index.html', 'Headline': 'Special counsel John Durham releases report on Trump-Russia probe - CNN', 'Snippet': 'Special Counsel John Durham’s report details his investigation of a purported effort by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign to tie Donald Trump to Russia – and Durham concluded that it “did ...'}, 6: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/966393/durham-report-five-key-takeaways-from-the-bombshell-findings-into-trump-russia-investigation/', 'Headline': 'Durham report: Five key takeaways from the bombshell findings into ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton connections.

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AP"", 'Full_text': 'Testifying under oath in a New York courtroom with the fate of his family\'s business empire on the line, former President Donald Trump lashed out against the judicial forces that put him there.\n\nTrump has already been found liable for fraud, a word he lobbed at the judge overseeing the civil trial against him. He said New York Attorney General Letitia James ""should be ashamed of herself.""\n\nOver the course of four hours on the stand on Monday, Trump repeatedly strayed from the questions, earning reprimands from New York Judge Arthur Engoron on several occasions. The judge, who was seated just feet away from Trump, will decide the outcome of the bench trial himself.\n\nThe case stems from a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by James\' office, which accused Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives of a yearslong fraud scheme. The state alleges the defendants inflated the value of the company\'s assets and Trump\'s personal wealth to obtain better terms on loans and insurance. The attorney general is seeking to recoup $250 million and limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York. The defendants have all denied wrongdoing, and Trump has repeatedly accused James of pursuing him for political reasons.\n\nIn his testimony, the former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination stood by the valuations of various Trump properties that other co-defendants have sought to distance themselves from.\n\n""The numbers of my net worth are substantially more than the numbers reflected on the financial statements,"" he said in one exchange. ""Therefore you have no case.""\n\nTrump\'s testimony\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan shortly before 10 a.m. and made brief remarks, reiterating his criticism of the trial.\n\n""It\'s a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I\'m going to be dealing with right now,"" Trump said. ""It\'s a very sad situation for our country.""\n\nOutside the courtroom, James predicted Trump would ""engage in name-calling, taunts and race-baiting,"" but said, ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers, and numbers, my friend, don\'t lie.""\n\nTrump then took the stand. Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the attorney general\'s office, kicked off the questioning by asking Trump about a trust he established to manage his assets before he entered the White House. When he left office in 2021, he took control of the trust, only to relinquish it again in July 2021. He testified that he did so because of increasing legal pressure from a number of fronts.\n\n""You and about every other Democrat district attorney, A.G., and U.S. attorney were coming at me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, Trump haters,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""great confidence"" in his son to manage his assets.\n\nTrump repeatedly gave long-winded answers to questions about the valuations of various Trump Organization properties, and Engoron\'s patience soon wore thin. Christopher Kise, one of Trump\'s attorneys, encouraged Engoron to allow Trump to give answers in his own way.\n\n""With this witness I would suggest it\'s far more efficient to listen to what he has to say and take it in,"" Kise said, prompting laughter from Wallace.\n\nEngoron\'s voice rose as his anger seemed to boil over, and his microphone struggled to handle the sudden change in volume.\n\n""No, I\'m not here to hear what he has to say,"" Engoron said, his voice rising. ""I\'m here to hear him answer questions. Sit down!""\n\nEngoron said he was considering drawing negative conclusions from Trump\'s testimony.\n\n""We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can\'t, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can,"" Engoron said.\n\nAfter a break, Wallace posed questions about the valuations of Trump\'s and his company\'s properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in Manhattan and an upstate New York estate known as Seven Springs. Trump defended the financial statements listing their supposed value, saying that even those valuations that have been determined to be inflated were too low. He added that he would not be willing to sell several properties because they were worth so much.\n\nJames\' office says the documents, known as statements of financial condition, inflated his net worth by billions. Trump said the documents included a disclaimer that absolved him of responsibility for inaccuracies.\n\n""The disclaimer clause says if there\'s a mistake, if there\'s something, don\'t rely on it,"" Trump said. ""[The disclaimers] always hold up in court, except maybe this court.""\n\nTrump also insisted that increases in property values over time justified overvaluations in the past, an argument Engoron has previously rejected. Discussing property valuations for 2014, Trump said, ""If you carry that forward to 2021, all of those valuations were low.""\n\nTrump became particularly animated during discussion of Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club where he resides for most of the year. Engoron\'s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for fraud noted that the local assessor valued Mar-a-Lago at $18 million, while in documents Trump valued it at hundreds of millions more. The former president said in his testimony that he believes it\'s worth as much as $1.5 billion.\n\nThe property is ""deed-restricted"" and cannot be used as a residence, which experts previously told CBS News limits its value. Trump said he agreed to the deed restriction for tax purposes, acknowledging that the lower assessed value limits the property\'s tax burden. He then described a hypothetical scheme in which a person calls their own home a club to save money on taxes.\n\n""There are a lot of advantages to the club status, the smartest thing to do would be to have a club and have one member,"" Trump said.\n\nHe later argued about whether it was accurate to value one of his Scottish golf clubs as if he has built nearly 2,500 new homes on it, when in fact he has built none and is limited by contract to just under 1,500.\n\n""At some point maybe in my very old age I\'ll go there and do the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen,"" the 77-year-old said.\n\nLater in the day, Trump described a loan related to Chicago property as having been ""long since gone."" Pressed on that detail, he conceded it was actually paid off ""very recently.""\n\nWallace then asked, ""Are you aware that the Trump Chicago loan was paid off last week?""\n\nTrump said he was, and that, ""my son recommended it,"" referring to Eric Trump, who testified about that and other properties on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nTrump said his company has begun looking into whether it needs to change internal policies as a result of the state\'s investigation.\n\n""There will be recommendations made, and we will perhaps let you know what those recommendations are, it wouldn\'t bother me to let you know about it. But we have asked,"" Trump said, adding that Eric Trump has been in charge of communicating with accountants and lawyers about that process.\n\nHe was excused from the witness stand shortly before 3:30 p.m., with the defense team declining to pose questions.\n\nThe fraud trial\n\nTrump is accused in the civil suit of being the primary beneficiary of a scheme to fraudulently portray his wealth as far greater than it is, and his properties as far more valuable, in order to get undeservedly favorable loan and insurance terms. The judge in the case has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their company liable for fraud, determining that the scheme led to hundreds of millions in unearned profits.\n\nThe trial is focused on other allegations, including falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud, as well as disgorgement — the exact amount of ""ill-gotten gains"" the Trumps must pay the state.\n\nTrump and his company have for more than a year blamed their former outside accountants, Mazars USA, for any inaccuracies in their statements of financial condition, essentially a snapshot of Trump\'s wealth. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump reiterated that defense in testimony last week, saying they ""trusted"" internal and external accounting teams.\n\nBut their former Mazars accountant testified in October that his firm merely compiled reams of financial information provided to them by the Trumps and their company.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking $250 million and sanctions designed to limit the Trumps\' ability to do business in New York, including permanently barring Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director in any business in the state.\n\nReporting contributed by Katrina Kaufman.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-civil-fraud-trial-11-06-23/index.html', 'Headline': 'Donald Trump testifies in New York civil fraud trial | CNN Politics', 'Snippet': ""From CNN's Dan Berman.

Incredible.”\n\nThe video, which has been viewed roughly 2.3m times, shows a packed house at Mr Trump’s rally in a stadium on Saturday, compared to a more modest crowd at the president’s speech on Tuesday in Wilkes-Barre.\n\nMr Trump, in his first major address since the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, indeed brought numerous supporters to the Mohegan Sun Area, which appeared to be at its capacity of 8,000 seats.\n\nThe former president used the “Save America” rally – nominally a speech to support Republicans seeking office in Pennsylvania like aspiring US senator Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano – to attack federal law enforcement and make unfounded claims about Democratic Senate hopeful John Fetterman using illegal drugs.\n\nMr Trump accused the Biden administration of “weaponising the FBI and Justice Department like never ever before” and described the court-authorised search of his property as the FBI “breaking into the homes of their political opponents”.\n\n“The FBI and the justice department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical-left scoundrels, lawyers and the media, who tell them what to do,” Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Biden was back in his home state this week as part of his own run of Pennsylvania midterm events.\n\nThe Biden speech shown in the comparison video took place on Tuesday in a gymnasium at Wilkes University, a small college with a student body of just over 2,000.\n\nAt the event, Mr Biden criticised Republicans for claiming to be the party of law and order, while backing the Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6.\n\n“So let me say this to my Maga Republican friends in Congress: Don’t tell me you support law enforcement if you won’t condemn what happened on the 6th,” he said. “Don’t tell me. Can’t do it.”\n\nHe continued: “For God’s sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Look, you’re either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6th ‘patriots’. You can’t do it.”\n\nTwo days later, Mr Biden gave a primetime address in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the Constitution was drafted.\n\n“Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal,” he said, adding that the man he defeated nearly two years ago – former president Mr Trump – and his “Maga Republican” allies “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic”.\n\n“That is a threat to this country,” he continued.\n\nIt’s not the first time crowd-size comparisons are part of the political conversation.\n\nPerhaps the first scandal of the Trump White House involved the then-president and his aides making dubious claims about the crowd size at Mr Trump’s January 2017 inauguration.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://heavy.com/news/trump-vs-biden-tampa-rally-crowd-photos/', 'Headline': 'Trump vs. Biden Tampa Rally Attendance: See Crowd Size Photos - Heavy.com', 'Snippet': 'NBC News reported that Biden’s rally was attended by close to 300 cars.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/us/politics/jan-6-committee-key-findings.html', 'Headline': 'Key Findings From the Jan. 6 Committee’s Report, Annotated', 'Snippet': 'Trump supporters storming the Senate side of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues ""on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.""\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has ""not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.""\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or ""coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies"" and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nRead more: After third venue cancels, Gaetz, Greene take \'protest against communism\' to Riverside\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills.

Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers ""are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.""\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue\'s conditional use permit would be ""in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.""\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a ""peaceful protest against communism"" outside Riverside City Hall.\n\n“These folks they tried to cancel our venues but they can never cancel our patriotism or our American spirit,” Gaetz said in a video filmed outside Riverside City Hall. “They’ll hear us all throughout Southern California.”\n\nSign up for Essential California, your daily guide to news, views and life in the Golden State.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-firebrands-matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-accuse-two-cities-deep-blue-state-free-speech-rights', 'Headline': 'House GOP firebrands accuse 2 cities in deep-blue state of violating ...', 'Snippet': 'The scheduled rally in California was initially at Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center, whose owner said he canceled after learning Gaetz and Taylor Greene would be speaking.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/gop-reps-greene-and-gaetz-sue-anaheim-and-riverside-for-free-speech-rights/', 'Headline': 'GOP Reps.

Kellogg said he was present at the time of Trump’s request, and Congress should release his testimony to the public.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he requested National Guard troops be activated in D.C. to provide security as he called on supporters to gather in D.C. to protest the certification of the 2020 election results for Joe Biden. Trump’s claim has been substantiated by members of his administration, but rejected by some members of Congress.\n\nKellogg, who was serving as Vice President Mike Pence’s National Security Advisor at the time of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol breach, tweeted last week, “To be clear on 6 Jan/NG. Pg 199 of my book, ‘On 3 Jan the President asked the Def Dept to deploy NG troops’ into DC for J6 contingencies. OK for J6 Cmte to publicly release my full sworn testimony. Release Army Guard and DC Mayor J6 testimonies as well. Would be illuminating.”\n\nKellogg now serves as the co-chairman of the America First Policy Institute’s (AFPI) Center for American Security.\n\nAccording to an initial timeline published by the U.S. Capitol Police, a Pentagon employee named Carol Corbin reached out to Capitol Police Deputy Chief Sean Gallagher on Jan. 2, 2021 to determine whether Capitol Police were considering a request for National Guard soldiers in anticipation of planned election protest events on January 6. Gallagher replied on Jan. 3 that the Capitol Police were not planning to make such a request.\n\nAccording to a Department of Defense Inspector General report from November, Trump asked acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley on Jan. 3 about preparations for election protests on Jan. 6.\n\n“The President told Mr. Miller that there would be a large number of protestors on January 6, 2021,” the DoD report states. “And Mr. Miller should ensure sufficient National Guard or Soldiers would be there to make sure it was a safe event. Gen Milley told us that Mr. Miller responded, ‘We’ve got a plan and we’ve got it covered.'”\n\nMiller testified to Congress in May of 2021 that Trump also asked him if D.C.’s mayor had requested any National Guard troops and instructed him to “fill” a request.\n\nA recent Washington Times op-ed criticized the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. The op-ed said the select committee does not have legitimate Republican representation. Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Liz Cheney (R-WY) are the only two Republicans currently allowed on the committee.\n\nDavid Bossie, who wrote the Washington Times op-ed noted Jan. 3 conversation between Trump and Miller and said the Jan. 6 select committee is “crafting a narrative that doesn’t quite add up and omits important facts that would not stand if there were proper Republican representation on the committee.”\n\nBossie was deputy campaign manager of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKellogg responded to Bossie’s op-ed in a tweet Friday, saying, “Great OpEd. Reinforces my earlier comment on 6 Jan Cmte.

This isn’t the first time this particular claim has gone viral. In February 2021, as reported by the Washington Post, during a Fox news interview with Steve Hilton, President Donald Trump claimed that he “requested” 10,000 National Guard troops to be deployed to the Capitol, but that his request was rejected by Pelosi.\n\nIn Trump’s words: “I requested … I definitely gave the number of 10,000 National Guardsmen, and [said] I think you should have 10,000 of the National Guard ready. They took that number. From what I understand, they gave it to the people at the Capitol, which is controlled by Pelosi. And I heard they rejected it because they didn’t think it would look good. So, you know, that was a big mistake.”\n\nThe claim that Pelosi rejected Trump’s request for a National Guard presence on January 6 is false.\n\n“The speaker of the House does not have the power to block an order from the commander in chief,” Drew Hammil, deputy chief of staff for Pelosi, told The Dispatch Fact Check via email. “This is fiction.”\n\nJosh Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, similarly told The Dispatch Fact Check that “the speaker does not have control of any branch of the armed services.”\n\n“The National Guard can only be activated by the president or a governor,” Huder added. “In the case of D.C., it can only be mobilized by the president of the United States.”\n\nA statement from Ryan McCarthy, secretary of the Army under Donald Trump, on the “National Guard response to timing and coordination with other States,” does not mention Trump’s request for a National Guard presence, nor does it mention anything about Pelosi rejecting the alleged request. A section of the statement reads:\n\nDuring a rapidly evolving situation Wednesday Jan. 6, the Department Defense was fielding uncoordinated calls from hundreds of elected officials requesting and offering assistance to respond to the unprecedented breach of the U.S. Capitol Building. The Army and the D.C. National Guard were coordinating with the federal Capitol Police and the local D.C. Metropolitan Police Department to assist with an immediate response. Secretary McCarthy first spoke with Governor Hogan at 4:40 p.m. on Jan. 6, where he thanked Governor Hogan’s offer to provide support. Secretary McCarthy thanked Gov. Hogan for his support and ensured him his service members will be taken care of and provided a point-to-point contact.\n\nAlso, it’s with noting that during the first day of hearings by the January 6 committee, Rep. Liz Cheney said: “Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets. But Mike Pence did each of those things.”\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.

Support NRA-ILA. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them.

That nugget about last year’s input was originally leaked to Gun Owners of America, according to 2A activist and writer John Crump, who adds that gun rights activists are especially concerned because of a recent push by the ATF to have FFL’s store their finished 4473 forms digitally.\n\nThe ATF has removed the time limit that the FFLs are required to keep the documents on-site, meaning the FFLs can never get rid of a form 4473 once it gets entered into their system except when turning the records over to the ATF. If an FFL turned over the records, then that would mean that those files would become part of the 920 million records currently held by the ATF.\n\nWhile the ATF maintains that the database is used to help trace firearms that are recovered, some Republicans on Capitol Hill are concerned about the massive collection of information.\n\nRep. Michael Cloud (R., Texas), who led an investigation into the ATF database following a November Free Beacon report that the Biden administration had stockpiled records of more than 54 million gun transactions in 2021, expressed shock at the number of gun records being kept by the federal government. Cloud maintains that the ATF’s database could be exploited by the Biden administration to surveil American gun owners as it pursues new restrictions on firearms.\n\n“A federal firearm registry is explicitly banned by law. Yet, the Biden administration is again circumventing Congress and enabling the notably corrupt ATF to manage a database of nearly a billion gun transfer records,” Cloud told the Free Beacon. “Under the president’s watch, the ATF has increased surveillance on American gun owners at an abhorrent level. The Biden administration continues to empower criminals and foreign nationals while threatening the rights of law-abiding Americans. It’s shameful and this administration should reconsider its continued attacks on American gun owners.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Free Beacon, the ATF says it has already fully digitized more than 850-million firearms transaction records. While the ATF has long had access to paper copies of the records, including those stored on-site at FFLs, the database itself is a more recent development, and one that some 2A groups are taking seriously.\n\nAidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, an advocacy group that has closely tracked the ATF’s database, told the Free Beacon that it is becoming clear the Biden administration is on its way to creating a national gun registry.\n\n“Make no mistake—this is clear evidence that a partial national gun registry exists,” Johnston said. “If the American people don’t stand up for their rights now, Biden’s anti-gun ATF will be able to track gun owners, infringe on our rights, and potentially even confiscate our firearms.”\n\nIs this a true gun registry? Not really, but if it doesn’t already violate existing law it dances close to the edge of legality. The database can’t track private firearm sales, for instance, which is one reason why gun control activists continue to push to criminalize the activity and why many gun owners are so insistent that it’s none of the government’s business what they do with the guns that are their own private property.\n\nHome-built guns are also not going to be a part of this database, though the Biden administration is making moves there as well. The ATF is currently finalizing a proposed rule that would require even unfinished gun parts to be serialized and treated as a working firearm under federal law before they could be sold to consumers, though the proposal is going to have a difficult time catching up to the reality that a solid block of aluminum can be turned into a working receiver in just a matter of hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI agree with Johnson of the GOA that the American people need to take this seriously. I would just add that while that absolutely includes contacting your representative and senator and urging them to curb this attempt by the Biden administration to create a backdoor gun registry, it also means opposing tools that can be used to establish an illegal gun registry, like universal background checks. Further, it means supporting efforts to make it easier for responsible Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights without having to first get permission from their local, state, or federal governments.\n\nThe ATF has long been able to use the de-centralized firearms transaction records to trace individual firearms if needed, and personally, I think the risks of establishing a centralized and computerized database far outweigh the benefit to law enforcement. I’m not unsympathetic to the argument that a computerized database can dramatically speed up that process, but that doesn’t change the fact that the ATF is in essence doing what Congress has specifically said is not allowed. I just hope that if Republicans do take back the House (and potentially the Senate as well) come November this doesn’t suddenly and inexplicably become an issue that can be left on the back burner. There was a case to be made for serious ATF reform even before the Biden administration decided to turn it into a political vehicle for his gun control agenda, but the need has become even more acute since, and it should be a top priority for the GOP if they take charge of Congress on Election Day.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes."", 'Full_text': 'In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden made a promise to ""protect seniors\' lives.""

The result, she claims, was millions of Americans receiving ""a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented.""\n\nPfizer delegated management of the worldwide clinical trial to Icon and hired Ventavia Research Group to run Phase 3 test sites in Texas. As Ventavia regional director, Jackson oversaw its trials in Fort Worth and Keller.\n\nShe internally aired her concerns, including ineligible trial participants, lack of informed consent, failure to preserve ""blinding"" and report adverse events, poor record-keeping, unqualified vaccinators, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act violations, ""improperly dilut[ing]"" the vaccine, and ""deviations from recommended temperature,"" which is crucial for mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer\'s.\n\nVentavia ""allowed the majority of violations to continue unabated"" and fired Jackson hours after she called the FDA\'s hotline Sept. 25, 2020, to report trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns, the suit claims. When she told Pfizer, it responded by ""expanding its trial to include even more participants.""\n\nWhile Jackson only witnessed misconduct in Texas, ""Pfizer and Icon\'s oversight failures and fraudulent misconduct vis-a-vis Ventavia bring the entire Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial into question,"" she claims.\n\n""We are gratified the government has declined the case,"" Lauren Foreman, Ventavia director of business development and communications, wrote in an email to Just the News.\n\n""Ms. Jackson worked for us for only 18 days and, as a result, did not complete the requisite training for the role for which she was hired. We are confident in our practices and procedures in conducting clinical trials, and, should her case move forward, we will respond to the litigation accordingly.""\n\nPfizer and Icon didn\'t respond to Just the News queries. The Justice Department and the FDA both declined to explain why they aren\'t electing to participate in the case.\n\nThe case docket shows Jackson lost her Texas-based lawyers in October but got new representation two months later, led by Los Angeles-based Robert Barnes, who represented Covington Catholic students in a defamation lawsuit.\n\nThe Jackson suit isn\'t listed on Barnes\' page for active cases, however. Neither he nor cocounsel Lexis Anderson responded to queries.\n\nIt\'s not clear whether the scope of the litigation has expanded. The Epoch Times reported last week that Jackson\'s unnamed lawyer threatened to sue Ventavia for defamation based on its characterization of her employment.\n\n\'Cleanup on aisle five\'\n\nOn Feb. 10, U.S. District Judge Michael Truncale unsealed the January 2021 complaint and authorized Jackson to serve it on the defendants. Also made public: more than 400 pages of exhibits (1-10, 11-20, 20-29).\n\nThe Epoch Times, which posted the exhibits, said they show among other things that Pfizer was aware of the Ventavia problems. The FDA told the publication last year it has ""full confidence in the data that were used to support"" the emergency use authorization of Pfizer\'s vaccine and full approval of its branded vaccine Comirnaty.\n\nAt the request of the U.S., Truncale agreed to seal all other documents already in the court record but not those subsequently filed. Jackson, however, provided other non-public evidence to select journalists, including recordings of Ventavia meetings.\n\nPaul Thacker, who previously investigated financial ties between physicians and pharmaceutical companies for the Senate Finance Committee, published an investigation in the British Medical Journal last fall.\n\nIn one recording, executives reportedly say Ventavia is finding ""something new every day"" in trial paperwork errors and dreading a possible FDA site visit. Another clinical trial veteran told Thacker that Ventavia was a ""helter skelter"" work environment and its data were a ""crazy mess.""\n\nJournalist Matt Taibbi said he listened to a recording on which a Ventavia executive referred to its trial data problems as ""cleanup on aisle five"" and seemed to quiz Jackson about whether she had spilled the beans to outsiders.\n\nFacebook throttled the BMJ report and warned users not to share it because the social media company\'s contracted fact-checker, Lead Stories, claimed the reporting would not ""disqualify"" the overall Pfizer COVID vaccine trial. Asked about possible litigation, BMJ recently told Just the News it was ""considering all available options.""\n\nThacker told Just the News that he could tell Pfizer\'s public relations team was feeding questions to other journalists, based on the inquiries he got. If his reporting were unverified, Pfizer would have sicced its army of lawyers on him, he argued.\n\nD.C. lawyers know how careful he is, and he has more documentation than he has published, Thacker said.\n\nHe was primed to be skeptical of fact-checks by his previous BMJ investigation into how ""contemporary science journalism"" explained the wrongful designation of the COVID ""lab leak"" as a conspiracy theory for a year.\n\n""I thought it was a joke at first"" when Lead Stories faulted his report, which it erroneously described as a ""blog,"" Thacker said. The fact-checker subsequently defended itself by claiming the BMJ report was misleading readers and being promoted by anti-vaccine pundits, and that Jackson ""does not [personally] express unreserved support"" for COVID vaccines.\n\nLead Stories specifically faulted BMJ for leading the report with Pfizer and referring to the company throughout, even though it documented problems at Ventavia. That\'s because Pfizer repeatedly designated the trial as ""rigorous"" despite its familiarity with Ventavia\'s problems, Thacker told Just the News.\n\nHe characterized ""rigorous"" as a mindless buzzword to defend COVID vaccine reviews, used by acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock to approve Pfizer\'s vaccine for 5-11 year-olds. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy did the same when discussing why the FDA was reviewing a vaccine for younger children despite poor results from Pfizer\'s two-dose trial.\n\n""It felt like you\'re watching the NBA Finals and suddenly one of the teams starts kicking the ball"" like the Harlem Globetrotters, Thacker said, referring to Lead Stories\' evolving explanations.\n\nJackson\'s claims are much more than ""allegations,"" according to Thacker, backed by recordings, photographs, emails and other internal documents, including the FDA\'s formal response to her complaint.\n\nHe said Ventavia\'s initial response to the investigation, that Jackson wasn\'t part of the trial, is directly contradicted by a recording with a Pfizer official. ""It\'s an old Eddie Murphy skit"" where a boyfriend caught cheating tells his girlfriend ""it wasn\'t me,"" Thacker said.\n\nOne of Jackson\'s claims is that Ventavia had too few employees to handle the volume of trial participants. Thacker said a second Ventavia whistleblower subsequently told him its trial actually had four times as many participants (4,000) as the company told the FDA in writing, roughly 10% of the total, but Thacker couldn\'t document this due to the alleged sloppiness of the data.\n\nHe\'s not sure about doing a followup on clinical trial problems despite having unpublished documentation. ""What do you do next?"" Thacker asked rhetorically. ""The FDA doesn\'t care, and Pfizer keeps rolling.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-ventavia-research-grp', 'Headline': 'United States v.

[Dkt. 51 at 6; Dkt. 53 at 16 n.1; Dkt. 67 at 14; Dkt. 68 at 5; Dkt. 69 at 5].\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Operation Warp Speed\n\nThere was no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic. To address this urgent need, the Government launched Operation Warp Speed on May 15, 2020. [Dkt. 17 at 18]. Operation Warp Speed was an interagency partnership between the United States Department of Defense (""DoD"") and the United States Department of Health and Human Services that coordinated federal efforts to accelerate the development, acquisition, and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. Id. Soon thereafter, Pfizer began working to develop a vaccine. Id. at 24.\n\nIn June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") published guidance regarding the data and information needed to support issuance of Emergency Use Authorization (""Emergency Authorization"") for COVID-19 vaccines. [Dkt. 17-1\n\nat 312; Dkt. 37 at 11 n.5]. The guidance explained that the FDA may issue Emergency Authorization upon its determination—based on ""the totality of the available scientific evidence""—that: (1) ""studies have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine""; and (2) ""the known and potential benefits of a product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat serious or life-threatening diseases, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product."" Id. The guidance specifies that ""the primary efficacy endpoint estimate for a placebo-controlled efficacy trial should be at least 50%"" in order to ""ensure that a widely deployed COVID-19 vaccine is effective."" Id.\n\nIn July 2020, while Pfizer\'s vaccine was still under development, the DoD entered into a contract (the ""Project Agreement"") with Pfizer, under which Pfizer would deliver 100 million doses of a FDA authorized or approved vaccine to the Government on a fixed price per dose basis, in accordance with a ""Statement of Work."" [Dkt. 17-1 at 303-37]. The Statement of Work provides that the Government will pay $1.95 billion for 100 million doses—or $19.50 per dose—of Pfizer\'s vaccine, if Pfizer first secures FDA approval or Emergency Authorization. Id. at 319.\n\nB. Pfizer\'s Clinical Trial and the FDA\'s Authorization\n\nAfter executing the Project Agreement, Pfizer endeavored to launch a clinical trial in order gain FDA approval or Emergency Authorization for its vaccine. [Dkt. 17 at 6-7]. Before starting the trial, Pfizer submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (""IND"") to the FDA. Id. at 19, 36; [Dkt. 17-1 at 51-53]. Pfizer\'s IND included a cover sheet, known as Form FDA-1571, wherein Pfizer committed to: (1) conduct the trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements; and (2) utilize an Institutional Review Board for continuing review and approval of the trial. [Dkt. 17 at 19, 36] (citing 21 C.F.R. § 312.23(a)(iv)-(v)). Pfizer also included its trial protocol in the IND. [Dkt. 17 at 19, 36].\n\nPfizer enlisted the help of ICON, an Irish-headquartered clinical research organization, and Ventavia, a testing site operator, to conduct the clinical trial. Id. at 7. ICON and Ventavia each submitted a document titled Form FDA-1572 to Pfizer and\n\nthe FDA, in which ICON and Ventavia certified that they would: (1) conduct the trial in accordance with protocol and FDA regulations; (2) obey informed consent and Institutional Review Board reporting requirements; (3) report adverse events; (4) ensure that all employees were informed of their obligations; and (5) make no changes to the trial without Institutional Review Board approval. Id. at 20, 36, 73; [Dkt. 17-1 at 55-56].\n\nPfizer conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of its vaccine against COVID-19 in healthy individuals. [Dkt. 17-1 at 143]. A total of 43,661 participants enrolled in the clinical trial across 160 testing sites worldwide. [Dkt. 17 at 7, 24; Dkt. 17-1 at 292]. Pfizer delegated oversight of those testing sites to ICON. [Dkt. 17 at 7]. ICON was responsible for ensuring compliance with reporting requirements and clinical trial protocol. Id. Pfizer contracted with Ventavia to operate three testing sites in Houston, Fort Worth, and Keller, Texas. Id. Approximately 1,500 participants enrolled at the Ventavia testing sites. Id.\n\nA ""placebo-controlled"" trial is one in which there are at least two groups—one gets the active treatment, the other gets the placebo, and everything else is held the same between the groups, so that any difference in their outcome can be attributed to the active treatment. A ""randomized"" trial is one in which the participants are divided by chance into separate groups that compare different treatments. An ""observer blind"" trial is one in which those charged with measuring, recording, and assessing changes in research participants do not know which of the participants have received the active treatment and which have received the placebo.\n\nPfizer announced the results from its clinical trial on November 18, 2020. Id. at 25. Data analysis from 41,135 trial participants showed that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective against COVID-19. [Dkt. 17-1 at 290-92]. Safety data showed a favorable safety profile and raised no serious safety concerns. Id. Pfizer asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for emergency use on November 20, 2020. [Dkt. 17 at 25]. Relying on Pfizer\'s clinical trial results, the FDA concluded that the key criteria for issuance of Emergency Authorization were met: the ""totality of the available data provide[d] clear evidence"" that the Pfizer vaccine ""may be effective in preventing COVID-19,"" and that ""the known and potential benefits outweigh[ed] the known and potential risks."" Id. at 25 n.5. The FDA noted that its review process also included ""public and independent review"" and that it had ""conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information."" Id. Accordingly, the FDA granted Emergency Authorization on December 11, 2020. Id. at 25. Pfizer sent its first invoice to the\n\nGovernment on December 31, 2020. [Dkt. 37-2 at 2]. Pfizer certified in its invoice that the invoice was ""true and correct, prepared from Pfizer\'s books and records, and in accordance with the Pfizer-DoD contract."" [Dkt. 17 at 73] (citing 48 C.F.R. 52.232-32(m)).\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the FDA fully approved Pfizer\'s vaccine for individuals sixteen years of age and older by granting a Biologics License Application. [Dkt. 17 at 9]. To date, the FDA has not revoked its approval of Pfizer\'s vaccine, and the Government continues to provide the vaccine to Americans at no cost. Id. at 18 n.2.\n\nC. Clinical Trial Protocol Violations\n\nMs. Jackson worked as a Regional Director at two of Ventavia\'s testing sites from September 8 to September 25, 2020. Id. at 11, 15. During her eighteen days of employment, she allegedly witnessed numerous violations of Pfizer\'s clinical trial protocol. Id. at 36-59. Many of the alleged violations involved a failure to maintain accurate documentation. Ventavia was required to scan or enter data from clinical trial participants\' ""source documents"" into a database so that it could be passed on to ICON and Pfizer Id. at 12. Ventavia was also responsible for ""quality checking"" all source documents before scanning or uploading them. Id. Ms. Jackson alleges, however, that on multiple occasions, Ventavia falsified information when conducting quality checks or otherwise hid protocol violations from Pfizer and ICON. Id. at 36-59. The Court turns to the alleged protocol violations.\n\n1. Ineligible Participants\n\nPfizer\'s protocol did not permit pregnant women to participate in the clinical trial. Id. at 36. Ms. Jackson alleges that Ventavia nonetheless administered the vaccine or placebo to pregnant women and did not report to Pfizer and ICON that pregnant women participated in the trial. Id. at 37.\n\nRelatedly, Ventavia also allegedly considered women with a tubal ligation as not capable of becoming pregnant, even though the protocol did not list tubal ligation as an accepted contraception method. Id. Ms. Jackson contends that Ventavia\'s violations involving tubal ligation would have been ""obvious from the source documents,"" but that Pfizer and ICON ignored these ""red flags"" and failed to exclude trial data from ineligible participants. Id.\n\nVentavia also allegedly violated protocol by not testing a participant for COVID-19 until after administering the vaccine. Id. at 38-39. Ventavia allegedly falsified this participant\'s source document by crossing out a question about why vaccination preceded informed consent and adding a comment that the informed consent time was incorrect. Id. Ventavia allegedly further violated protocol by enrolling Ventavia employees and their family members in the clinical trial, id. at 39, and by examining married couples or groups of friends at the same time instead of individually. Id. at 53. Ms. Jackson contends this that last practice would have been apparent to Pfizer and ICON from overlapping times in the source documents. Id. 2. Unblinding\n\nThe clinical trial was an observer-blinded study. Id. at 39. The only ""unblinded"" people at Ventavia\'s testing sites should have been those administering shots. Id. Ms. Jackson alleges three incidents that unblinded, or had the potential to unblind, staff and participants. First, she alleges that containers marked with numbers that would enable someone to determine whether a participant received the vaccine or placebo were left out in the open. Id. at 39, 41. Second, on one occasion Ms. Jackson alleges that she was inadvertently unblinded after receiving an email containing participant numbers and dosing information. Id. at 40-41. And third, she alleges that ""randomization documents,"" which reveal whether a participant received a placebo, were improperly placed in the charts of 1,200 participants. Id. at 39-40. Ventavia subsequently removed or crossed out this information, but it had allegedly been visible to employees and participants for over two months. Id. at 40. Ms. Jackson alleges that instead of reporting this incident to Pfizer or ICON, Ventavia placed ""Notes to File"" in each participant\'s chart stating that randomization documents should not be included in the chart. Id. The Notes to File were not viewable to Pfizer or ICON until the end of the clinical trial. Id. Ms. Jackson asserts, however, that a Ventavia employee alerted Pfizer of this third incident via an email sent to Pfizer employee, Dr. Arturo Alfaro. Id. In the email, the Ventavia employee asked Dr. Alfaro to confirm that randomization documents should not be given to blinded staff. Id. Dr. Alfaro concurred with this statement. Id. According to Ms. Jackson, Pfizer should have realized that the Ventavia employee\'s inquiry ""could indicate that unblinding had already occurred."" Id. Pfizer did not follow up on this issue or remove the potentially affected participants\' data from the trial results. Id.\n\n3. Temperature Deviations\n\nOn at least one occasion, a freezer containing vaccines was allegedly unplugged and moved, resulting in a ""temperature excursion."" Id. at 42. Ventavia allegedly reported the excursion to Pfizer late, in violation of the protocol requirement that excursions be reported as soon as discovered. Id. In addition, although the protocol required thawing the vaccine for thirty minutes prior to administration, Ms. Jackson alleges that, at times, Ventavia employees only waited twenty minutes and held the vaccine vials in their hands to expedite thawing. Id. at 44. Ms. Jackson asserts that an email exchange between a Ventavia employee and Dr. Alfaro should have put Pfizer on notice about these deviations. Pfizer did not remove affected participants\' data from the trial results. Id.\n\n4. Informed Consent\n\nMs. Jackson also alleges that Ventavia violated trial protocol by taking participants\' vital signs or administering the vaccine before obtaining their informed consent. Id. at 38, 42-44. Ventavia, while conducting quality checks, allegedly hid these violations by falsifying source documents to make it appear as though its employees had obtained informed consent before taking the vital signs or administering the vaccine. Id. Ms. Jackson asserts, however, that two email chains put Pfizer and ICON on notice about informed consent timing discrepancies, id. at 43 (citing [Dkt. 17-2 at 60-67, 69-74]), and that Pfizer and ICON had access to the source documents, thereby imparting constructive knowledge. Id. Pfizer included data from affected participants in the trial results. Id.\n\n5. Improper Training\n\nVentavia allegedly violated trial protocol by allowing improperly trained or unqualified\n\nemployees to administer the vaccine. Id. at 44. One medical assistant allegedly administered vaccines before receiving required training. Id. And another employee, with no medical qualifications, allegedly administered the vaccine as well. Id. at 45.\n\n6. Improper Administration and Monitoring\n\nVentavia allegedly administered the second dose of the vaccine to participants outside of the protocol-mandated nineteen-to-twenty-three-day window. Id. Ms. Jackson asserts that Ventavia did not report these violations to Pfizer or ICON but that they ""would have been obvious from the source documents."" Id. at 45-46. Further, vaccinators allegedly sometimes used the wrong sized needle to administer the vaccine. Id. at 46. Pfizer included data from these participants in the trial results. Id.\n\nOn at least four occasions Ventavia employees allegedly used 1.7 milliliters instead of 1.2 milliliters of sodium chloride to dilute the vaccine. Id. ICON noticed this issue and brought it to Ventavia\'s attention. Id. But Ms. Jackson alleges that Ventavia falsely told ICON that the discrepancy was due to a transcription error. Id.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Jackson alleges that the trial protocol required placing participants under ""medical supervision"" for thirty minutes after receiving the vaccine, id. (citing [Dkt. 17-1 at 101, 118, 194]), but that some participants were supervised for less than thirty minutes and/or supervised by a ""non-medically-qualified employee."" Id. at 46-47. Ms. Jackson communicated this issue to Dr. Alfaro during an anonymous phone call, which she believes should have alerted Pfizer to the protocol deviation. Id. at 47.\n\n7. Adverse Event Reporting\n\nMs. Jackson alleges that Ventavia did not report all Adverse Events (""AEs"") and Serious Adverse Events (""SAEs"") to Pfizer and ICON. Id. at 48. She asserts that Pfizer and ICON had constructive notice that Ventavia was not reporting all AEs and SAEs because they had access to the participants\' ""electronic diary"" entries, where the participants recorded their post-vaccination symptoms. Id. at 28, 49.\n\n8. Improper Recordkeeping\n\nMs. Jackson alleges that Ventavia also failed to maintain accurate and complete documentation throughout the trial. Id. She broadly asserts that Pfizer and ICON ""turned a blind eye"" to this inadequate recordkeeping ""despite obvious warning signs"" and that these ""sloppy"" documents were included in Pfizer\'s trial results. Id. The Amended Complaint alleges four examples of improper recordkeeping.\n\nFirst, a blood draw log from Ventavia\'s Fort Worth testing site allegedly contained inaccurate or missing time entries. Id. at 50. ICON was aware of this issue because it ""directly questioned missing blood collection and processing times."" Id. at 51. Second, Ms. Jackson allegedly saw a Ventavia employee change the blood pressure readings in participant source documents. Id. Third, Ventavia allegedly delayed implementing a review log system to monitor participants for COVID-19 symptoms. Id. at 52. Ms. Jackson contends that Notes to File were documented for this third issue, thereby imparting constructive knowledge to Pfizer and ICON. Id.\n\nFinally, Dr. Mark Koch, the principal investigator at Ventavia\'s Fort Worth testing site, allegedly ""signed off"" on records for participants that were actually examined by sub-investigator doctors or other medical staff. Id. at 53. Relatedly, one record did not contain a principal investigator signature. Id. at 54. Ventavia did not\n\nreport the principal investigator oversight issues to Pfizer or ICON. Id. at 53.\n\n9. Privacy Law Violations\n\nVentavia employees allegedly violated Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (""HIPAA"") regulations and trial protocol by leaving participants\' files unattended and displaying a calendar near a reception area that contained participants\' names, phone numbers, and health information. Id. at 55. Ventavia employees also allegedly violated HIPAA by using the smartphone and computer application ""Slack"" to communicate participants\' names and identification numbers. Id.\n\nD. Alleged Safety and Ethical Issues\n\nIn addition to protocol violations, Ms. Jackson claims that she observed several ""safety and ethical issues"" during her employment with Ventavia. Id. at 58. First, she reports seeing used needles disposed of in biohazard bags. Id. The needles could have punctured the bags, thereby exposing Ventavia employees to risk of injury or infection. Id. Second, Ventavia internally requires participants\' charts to contain dosage ranges for epinephrine, a drug used to counter allergic reactions. Id. Ventavia allegedly did not follow this internal policy. Id. Third, in order to adhere to industry-standard practices, Ventavia employees were required to undergo training in biologics handling as well as occupational safety and health. Id. But Ventavia allegedly did not provide all employees with this training. Id. Finally, Ventavia allegedly breached its ethical obligations by providing unauthorized compensation to trial participants in the form of gift cards without IRB approval. Id.\n\nE. Retaliation Against Ms. Jackson\n\nMs. Jackson began her employment with Ventavia on September 8, 2020. Id. at 11. Her direct supervisor was Director of Operations Marnie Fisher. Id. at 60. Her other supervisors were Executive Director Olivia Ray, Executive Director Kristie Raney, and Chief Operating Officer Mercedes Livingston. Id. Ms. Jackson frequently reported her concerns about trial protocol and FDA regulation violations, as well as participant safety, to Ms. Fisher and Ms. Livingston. Id. at 61. Ms. Jackson alleges that each time she voiced her concerns to Ms. Fisher, she was instructed to send an email to Ms. Fisher or make a list of affected participants. Id.\n\nVentavia allegedly fell behind schedule on quality checking source documents. Id. at 62. As alleged above, Ventavia failed to catch mistakes or falsified data when conducting quality checks. Id. Ms. Jackson communicated her concerns about Ventavia\'s quality checking process to the Fort Worth Principal Investigator, Dr. Koch, as well as Ventavia management. Id. at 61-62. On September 15, 2020, Ms. Jackson reported to Ms. Fisher that Ventavia had failed to quality check certain participants\' charts and neglected to send some charts to Pfizer. Id. at 62.\n\nOn the night of September 16, 2020, Ms. Jackson took photographs of the biohazard bags that stored used needles. Id. She also photographed alleged HIPAA violations: the calendar in the reception area containing participants\' names and information, and other participant records that had been left out in public view. Id. at 63. Concerned about potential unblinding, she also took pictures of boxes labeled with participant randomization numbers. Id. Ms. Jackson shared these photographs with Ms. Fisher and Ms. Livingston via text message and e-mail. Id. at 65.\n\nOn September 17, 2020, Ms. Jackson spoke with Ventavia\'s Houston Regional Director, Lovica Downs, and Ventavia\'s Quality Control Director, William Jones,\n\non the telephone. Id. at 13, 65. When she asked for their opinions about what would happen if the FDA audited Ventavia, they allegedly both responded that Ventavia would receive warning letters or be asked to discontinue trial enrollment. Id. at 65.\n\nLater that day, during a phone call with Ms. Ray, Ms. Raney, Ms. Fisher, Ms. Downs, and Ms. Livingston, Ms. Jackson ""brought up virtually all of the protocol and regulatory violations she had witnessed to date, as well as Ventavia\'s HIPAA violations."" Id. Ms. Jackson explained that ""the FDA would likely issue warning letters against Ventavia if it visited or audited the trial sites"" and recommended that Ventavia stop enrollment. Id. Ms. Jackson also sent text messages to Ms. Ray, Ms. Raney, Ms. Fisher, Ms. Downs, and Ms. Livingston expressing concerns about Ventavia\'s quality checking of source documents and relaying concerns from the Operations Manager of Ventavia\'s Fort Worth site about protocol and HIPAA violations. Id.\n\nVentavia paused enrollment on September 17, 2020. Id. Ventavia allegedly was not honest with Pfizer about the reason for the enrollment pause. Id. at 66. Rather, Ms. Raney allegedly instructed Ventavia employees to respond to questions from Pfizer about the pause by stating that Ventavia was ""being responsible"" by recognizing that it had reached its ""bandwidth."" Id. Further, during the enrollment pause Ventavia allegedly failed to correct documentation violations and falsified missing or incorrect data. Id. at 67.\n\nOn September 23, 2020, Ms. Jackson emailed Ms. Ray, Ms. Raney, Ms. Fisher, Ms. Downs, Ms. Livingston, and Mr. Jones to report issues with Ventavia\'s quality checking process. Id. Her email noted outstanding inquiries from ICON about missing or inconsistent data, scheduling errors that resulted in participants receiving their second vaccine dose outside of the nineteen-to-twenty-three-day window, a delay in sending one participant\'s chart to ICON and Pfizer, and missing participant charts or laboratory specimens. Id. The next day she sent a separate email to Ms. Fisher expressing her concerns about Ventavia\'s failure to include dose ranges for epinephrine in participants\' charts. Id. at 68.\n\nOn September 24, 2020, Ms. Jackson met with Ms. Fisher and Mr. Jones. Id. During the meeting, Ms. Jackson discussed her concerns about safety issues, HIPAA violations, unblinding, and FDA regulatory violations. Id. at 68-69. She told Ms. Fisher and Mr. Jones to ""get on Google and search for FDA warning letters."" Id. at 69.\n\nOn September 25, 2020, Ms. Jackson ""called the FDA\'s hotline to report the clinical trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns she witnessed."" Id. at 69. Ventavia terminated Ms. Jackson\'s employment later that day. Id. After her termination, Ms. Jackson spoke with Dr. Alfaro at Pfizer about her concerns regarding unblinding, principal investigator oversight, and participant safety at the trial. Id. at 70. She also informed Dr. Alfaro that she had contacted the FDA. Id. Shortly after her termination, ""the FDA contacted [Ms. Jackson] and spoke to her for several hours regarding the violations she witnessed at Ventavia."" Id.\n\nA couple days later, Ventavia lifted the enrollment pause. Id. Ms. Jackson ""estimates that Ventavia had neither completed quality checking nor remedied its ongoing violations by the time it resumed enrollment."" Id.\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for ""failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court ""accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Sonnier v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 509 F.3d 673, 675 (5th Cir. 2007). While the Court must accept the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true, it will ""not accept as true conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual inferences, or legal conclusions."" Gentilello v. Rege, 627 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir. 2010).\n\nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain enough well-pleaded facts ""to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (""A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief....""). A claim is ""plausible on its face"" when the well-pleaded facts allow the Court to ""draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. ""Where a complaint pleads facts that are \'merely consistent with\' a defendant\'s liability, it \'stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\'"" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is ""a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense."" Id. at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937.\n\nComplaints filed pursuant to the False Claims Act must also satisfy the ""heightened"" pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). United States ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, 565 F.3d 180, 185 (5th Cir. 2009). Under Rule 9(b), a relator must plead ""with particularity"" the circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Knowledge, however, ""may be alleged generally."" United States v. Bollinger Shipyards, Inc., 775 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir. 2014).\n\nIII.

United States ex rel. Doe v. Dow Chem. Co., 343 F.3d 325, 329 (5th Cir. 2003). The FCA imposes liability on any person who (1) ""knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,"" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A); or (2) ""knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim."" Id. § 3729(a)(1)(B).\n\nRelevant here, ""claim"" means:\n\n[A] any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for money or property and whether or not the United States has title to the money or property, that—\n\n[1] is presented to an officer, employee, or agent of the United States; or\n\n[2] is made to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government\'s behalf or to advance a Government program or interest, and if the United States Government—\n\n[i] provides or has provided any portion of the money or property requested or demanded; or\n\n[ii] will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any\n\nportion of the money or property which is requested or demanded....\n\nId. § 3729(b)(2)(A).\n\nIn order to assess liability under § 3729(a)(1)(A) or § 3729(a)(1)(B), the Fifth Circuit asks ""(1) whether \'there was a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct; (2) made or carried out with the requisite scienter; (3) that was material; and (4) that caused the government to pay out money or to forfeit moneys due (i.e., that involved a claim).\'"" United States ex rel.

Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc., 525 F.3d 370, 376 (4th Cir. 2008)).\n\nClaims brought under § 3729(a)(1)(A) are referred to as presentment claims, while claims brought under § 3729(a)(1)(B) are referred to as false record claims. United States ex rel. Reddell v. DynCorp Int\'l, LLC, No. 1:14-CV-86, 2019 WL 12875471, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 20, 2019) (Crone, J.).\n\nA. Defendants\' Alleged False Claims\n\n1. Presentment Claims\n\nMs. Jackson\'s first cause of action asserts that Defendants, in violation of § 3729(a)(1)(A), ""knowingly presented, or caused the presentment of, false and/or fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the United States"" because ""Pfizer\'s claims for payment to the DoD were rendered false and/or fraudulent by express and implied false certifications."" [Dkt. 17 at 72]. She alleges the following in support of this claim:\n\nFirst, when Pfizer submitted its clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of its IND, Pfizer certified in Form FDA-1571 that it would conduct the clinical trial in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Id. Ms. Jackson alleges that Defendants violated FDA regulations\n\nand Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR"") requirements when conducting the clinical trial, thus rendering this certification false. [Dkt. 17 at 19, 35-36, 72].\n\nSecond, Pfizer acknowledged in Form FDA-1571 that making a willfully false statement is a criminal offense. Id. at 72. Ms. Jackson alleges that Defendants rendered Pfizer\'s acknowledgement in this form false by submitting false data to the FDA. Id.\n\nThird, ICON and Ventavia certified to Pfizer and the FDA in Form FDA-1572 that they would: (1) conduct the trial in accordance with protocol and FDA regulations; (2) obey informed consent and IRB reporting requirements; (3) report adverse events; (4) ensure that all employees were informed of their obligations; and (5) make no changes to the trial without IRB approval. Id. at 73. ICON and Ventavia acknowledged when submitting Form FDA-1572 that willfully making a false statement is a criminal offense. Ms. Jackson alleges that ICON and Ventavia rendered this certification and acknowledgement false by violating the clinical trial protocol, violating FDA regulations, and engaging in fraudulent conduct. Id.\n\nFourth, Ms. Jackson alleges that in accordance with FAR requirements, Pfizer certified in its claims for payment that the claims ""were true and correct, prepared from Pfizer\'s books and records, and in accordance with the Pfizer-DoD contract,"" id. (citing 48 C.F.R. 52.232-32(m)), and that Defendants\' alleged submission of false data, violation of FDA regulations, violations of FAR, and fraudulent conduct rendered this certification false. Id.\n\nMs. Jackson alleges that ""Defendants\' fraudulent schemes transform these certifications into false certifications, rendering [Pfizer\'s] claims for payment to the DoD false and/or fraudulent."" Id. She further alleges that Defendants\' knowing submissions of false claims were material to the Government\'s payment decision and that the DoD would not have paid Pfizer\'s claims if it had known of Defendants\' allegedly fraudulent conduct. Id. at 73-74.\n\n2. False Record Claims\n\nIn her second cause of action, Ms. Jackson asserts that Defendants violated § 3729(a)(1)(B) by ""knowingly ma[king], us[ing] or caus[ing] to be made or used, false records or statements that were material to false and/or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the [DoD]."" Id. at 74. She alleges that these ""false records or statements include the clinical trial protocol Pfizer submitted to the United States and the falsified source documents and data behind Defendants\' trial results and [Emergency Authorization] application."" Id. She asserts that Defendants knowingly violated § 3729(a)(1)(B), and that Defendants\' fraudulent scheme was material because the DoD would not have paid Pfizer\'s claims had it known about Defendants\' alleged use of false records and trial protocol deviations. Id. at 74-75.\n\nB. False Statement or Fraudulent Course of Conduct\n\nThe first element that a relator must plausibly allege in order to bring a qui tam action is the existence of ""a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct."" Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467.\n\n1. Presentment Claims—§ 3729(a)(1)(A)\n\nMs. Jackson first alleges violations of § 3729(a)(1)(A), which, as stated\n\nabove, makes liable any person who ""knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval."" § 3729(a)(1)(A). [Dkt. 17 at 72-74]. ""This provision includes an express presentment requirement."" Grubbs, 565 F.3d at 188. Indeed, ""the statute attaches liability, not to the underlying fraudulent activity or to the government\'s wrongful payment, but to the claim for payment."" Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467 (quoting Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 176 F.3d 776, 785 (4th Cir. 1999)) (emphasis added); see also United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 125 F.3d 899, 902 (5th Cir. 1997) (noting that ""[v]iolations of laws, rules, or regulations alone do not create a cause of action under the FCA"").\n\nA claim for payment under the FCA may be either factually false or legally false. Reddell, 2019 WL 12875471, at *12 (citing United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., 241 F. Supp. 3d 37, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2017)). Factually false claims represent that the claimant has provided goods or services that the Government never received. Id. Legally false claims, by contrast, contain an ""express"" or ""implied"" certification of compliance with statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements when, in fact, the claimant has not complied with such requirements. Thompson, 125 F.3d at 902; Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 186-90, 136 S.Ct. 1989, 195 L.Ed.2d 348 (2016). Here, Ms. Jackson asserts that Pfizer\'s claims for payment were rendered legally false by express and implied certifications. [Dkt. 17 at 72-74].\n\ni. Express False Certification\n\nThe ""express false certification theory of FCA liability is predicated upon outright misrepresentations made to the Government on an invoice or other claim for payment."" United States ex rel. Campbell v. KIC Dev., LLC, No. EP-18-CV-193-KC, 2019 WL 6884485, at *7 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2019). Two elements are required to plead express false certifications. First, the relator must allege that ""the government has conditioned payment of a claim upon a claimant\'s certification of compliance with, for example, a statute or regulation."" Thompson, 125 F.3d at 902. Second, the relator must allege that the claimant ""falsely certifie[d] compliance with that statute or regulation."" Id.\n\na. Condition of Payment\n\nWith respect to the first element, Defendants argue that the Government did not condition payment on compliance with FAR requirements or FDA regulations. [Dkt. 37 at 26]. As an initial matter, Defendants assert that the Government could not have conditioned payment on compliance with FAR requirements because FAR does not apply to contracts such as the Project Agreement. Id. at 11-12. Defendants claim that ""due to pandemic-related exigencies, the Project Agreement was not a standard federal procurement contract, but rather a \'prototype\' agreement executed pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2371b, which as of January 1, 2022, is now cited as 10 U.S.C. § 4022."" Id. (citing [Dkt. 17-1 at 304]).\n\nThe Project Agreement states: ""In accordance with 10 U.S.C. [§] 2731b(f), and upon a determination that the prototype project for this transaction has been successfully completed, this competitively awarded prototype [Other Transaction Authority] may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of competitive procedures."" [Dkt. 17-1 at 304].\n\nSuch prototype agreements are executed under the DoD\'s ""Other Transaction Authority""\n\nand, as a statutory matter, are not subject to FAR, which is the primary regulation otherwise used by Government agencies in their acquisition of supplies and services with appropriated funds. 10 U.S.C. § 4022(f)(2); see NSTI, LLC v. Def. Energy Ctr. of Excellence, No. 4:19-CV-03854, 2020 WL 1321530, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 17, 2020) (""Other Transactions are legally binding contracts that are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations."").\n\nIn her Response, Ms. Jackson argues that the Project Agreement was not properly authorized under § 4022. [Dkt. 65 at 39-41]. Section 4022 provides that an official designated by the Secretary of Defense may ""carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of personnel of the Department of Defense."" 10 U.S.C. § 4022(a)(1). Ms. Jackson reasons that because the vaccine ""ended up in many more people than just military personnel,"" the Project Agreement was not ""directly relevant"" to enhancing the mission effectiveness the military. [Dkt. 65 at 40]. Accordingly, she urges this Court to treat the Project Agreement as a traditional acquisition contract and rule that Defendants were required to comply with FAR. Id. at 39-41.\n\nMs. Jackson\'s contention is unreasonable. The fact that both military personnel and civilians received the vaccine does not indicate that acquiring the vaccine was irrelevant to enhancing the military\'s mission effectiveness. More importantly, Ms. Jackson is in effect asking this Court to overrule the DoD\'s decision to exercise Other Transaction Authority to purchase Pfizer\'s vaccine. But as the United States Supreme Court has long emphasized, the ""complex subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments."" Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10, 93 S.Ct. 2440, 37 L.Ed.2d 407 (1973). Thus, it is ""difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence."" Id. This Court will not veto the DoD\'s judgments concerning mission effectiveness during a national emergency.\n\nTurning to the language of the Project Agreement, Defendants correctly note that the Statement of Work makes no mention of the FDA or FAR provisions cited in Ms. Jackson\'s complaint. [Dkt. 37 at 26]. The Statement of Work instead conditioned payment, more simply, on Pfizer\'s delivery of an FDA authorized or approved vaccine. Id. Defendants emphasize that Pfizer\'s vaccine has satisfied that condition since December 2020 and continues to satisfy that condition to this day. Id.\n\nIn her Response to Defendants\' Motions, Ms. Jackson concedes that Pfizer\'s invoices were ""contractually justified"" and that ""[Emergency Authorization] [was] the express condition in the [Project] Agreement."" [Dkt. 65 at 18, 28]. At the hearing on Defendants\' Motions, however, Ms. Jackson pulled back on the concessions made in her pleading. See [Dkt. 94 at 9:7-13:10]. During oral argument, she asserted that the Statement of Work conditioned payment on compliance with FDA regulations. Id. To support her argument, Ms. Jackson highlighted a line in the ""Activities"" section of the Statement of Work that reads: ""Pfizer will meet the necessary FDA requirements for conducting ongoing and planned clinical trials...."" Id. (quoting [Dkt. 17-1 at 307]). The Court is not persuaded.\n\n""If there is a conflict between a general provision and a specific provision, the specific provision prevails...."" Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading\n\nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 183 (2012). ""Under this cannon, the specific provision is treated as an exception to the general rule."" Id. (citing Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 153, 96 S.Ct. 1989, 48 L.Ed.2d 540 (1976)). Another way to think of this is that ""the specific provision comes closer to addressing the very problem posed by the case at hand and is thus more deserving of credence."" Id. This rule applies to both statutes and contracts. Id. at 184.\n\nHere, the ""Introduction"" section of the Statement of Work states that the ""intent"" of the project is ""to demonstrate that Pfizer has the business and logistics capability to manufacture 100M doses of its currently unapproved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine for the Government."" [Dkt. 17-1 at 306]. The ""Activities"" section of the Statement of Work explains that the statement about Pfizer meeting all necessary FDA requirements is provided ""[s]olely for background and context"" for certain Government-funded projects. Id. at 307. But Pfizer\'s clinical trial was not funded by the Government. Indeed, while clinical activities are described for background and context, the ""Scope"" section of the Statement of Work specifies that clinical activities ""not related to the large-scale manufacturing"" of the vaccine are ""out-of-scope"" for the project as Pfizer ""ha[s] and will continue to fund these activities, without the use of Government funding."" Id. at 312.\n\nThe ""Payment"" section, moreover, identifies a single condition of payment: Pfizer\'s delivery of an FDA authorized or approved vaccine for COVID-19. Id. at 319. This section further specifies ""[f]or clarity"" that ""the Government will have no right to withhold payment in respect of any delivered doses, unless the FDA has withdrawn approval or authorization of the vaccine."" Id. at 320. And to date, the FDA has not withdrawn its approval or authorization of Pfizer\'s vaccine. [Dkt. 17 at 18 n.2].\n\nPut differently, the ""Activities"" section contains a ""general provision,"" see Scalia, supra at 183, that Pfizer will meet FDA regulations for its clinical trial. But the ""Scope"" and ""Payment"" sections clarify through several ""specific provisions,"" id., that Pfizer\'s privately funded clinical trial is not governed by the Statement of Work; the sole condition for payment is delivery of an FDA authorized or approved vaccine, and that the Government has no right to refuse payment unless and until the FDA revokes its approval or authorization. [Dkt. 17-1 at 305-20].\n\nMoreover, this Court\'s ""only function"" when construing a contract is to ""interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it."" Koontz v. Thomas, 333 S.C. 702, 708, 511 S.E.2d 407 (Ct. App. 1999) (quoting Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1995)). The United States—the other party to this contract—agrees with Pfizer that the parties did not intend to condition payment on regulatory or protocol compliance. The United States\' Statement of Interest puts it this way:\n\nThe complaint does not identify any provision in the SOW for the Project Agreement between Pfizer and the Army that conditioned Government payment for the vaccine on Pfizer\'s compliance with the clinical trial protocol or regulations. The SOW, which is attached to the complaint, further specifies that the Army did not regulate the conduct of the clinical trial, which is ""out-of-scope"" for the purchase agreement between the Army and Pfizer. In short, the complaint does\n\nnot plead factual content to support a conclusion that compliance with the clinical trial protocol or regulations was necessary under the contract between Pfizer and the Army such that clinical trial violations would give rise to a claim for express or implied certification liability.\n\n[Dkt. 70 at 10].\n\nIn sum, Ms. Jackson has failed to plead that the Government conditioned payment on Defendants\' certification of compliance with regulatory provisions or clinical trial protocol.\n\nb. False Certification of Compliance\n\nThe Amended Complaint also fails the second element of the express certification test: Pfizer did not make a claim for payment that falsely certified compliance with a statute or regulation. At the outset, the Court notes that the submission of Pfizer\'s trial protocol, Pfizer\'s Form FDA-1571, and ICON and Ventavia\'s Form FDA-1572s, were not claims for payment. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(2)(A); Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467 (noting that the FCA attaches liability to the ""claim for payment""). Accordingly, the Court only addresses Ms. Jackson\'s contention that Pfizer\'s invoices for payment contained express false certifications. [Dkt. 17 at 73].\n\nThe Amended Complaint asserts that Pfizer, as required under FAR, certified in its claims for payment ""that they were true and correct, prepared from Pfizer\'s books and records, and in accordance with the Pfizer-DoD contract."" Id. (citing 48 C.F.R. 52.232-32(m)). As discussed above, the Project Agreement was not subject to FAR. Therefore, contrary to Ms. Jackson\'s allegations, Pfizer\'s invoices were not required to contain the certification.\n\nDefendants point out that Pfizer\'s actual invoices do not contain any certifications about compliance with clinical trial protocol, FDA regulations, or FAR. [Dkt. 37 at 17]. Rather, Pfizer\'s invoices certify that ""the amounts invoiced are for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement, the work reflected has been performed, and prior payment has not been received."" [Dkt. 37-2 at 2].\n\nAgain, Ms. Jackson\'s pleadings contradict the assertions that she made at the hearing on Defendants\' Motions to Dismiss. Her Response admits that Pfizer\'s invoices ""do not contain false statements."" [Dkt. 65 at 18]. But during oral argument, Ms. Jackson contended that the words ""in accordance with the agreement"" contained in Pfizer\'s invoice was a representation that Pfizer would ""deliver something that met the FDA\'s requirements for clinical testing."" [Dkt. 94 at 11:22-12:20]. The Court disagrees for two reasons.\n\nFirst, reading ""in accordance with the agreement"" in isolation is misleading. When the phrase in which those words appear—""I certify that the amounts invoiced are for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement""—is read in its entirety, the meaning becomes clear. That is, the price reflected in the invoice—$19.50 per dose—matches the price stated in the Project Agreement. [Dkt. 17-1 at 319; Dkt. 37-2 at 2]. Second, even if ""in accordance with the agreement"" did refer to some other part of the Project Agreement, the Court has already found that Pfizer\'s clinical trial—the activity that Ms. Jackson bases her claims on—was ""out of scope"" for the Project Agreement between Pfizer and the DoD. Put simply, Pfizer\'s invoices do not contain any express false certifications.\n\nMs. Jackson has failed to allege facts that support either of the elements that are required to adequately plead liability under the express false certification theory of liability. ii. Implied False Certification\n\nFCA liability can arise not only from fraudulent misrepresentations that include express falsehoods, but also from fraudulent misrepresentations that include misleading half-truths. Escobar, 579 U.S. at 187-90, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (2016). The implied false certification theory recognizes that a fraudulent course of conduct is actionable under the FCA where two conditions are satisfied: ""first, [a claim submitted to the United States] does not merely request payment, but also makes specific representations about the goods or services provided; and second, the defendant\'s failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements makes those representations misleading half-truths."" Id. at 190, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (emphasis added).\n\nFor example, in Escobar, Massachusetts Medicaid required mental health counselors to possess certain licenses and qualifications. Id. at 183-84, 189-91, 136 S.Ct. 1989. The defendant, a mental health facility, specifically represented through the billing codes listed on its claims for payment to Medicaid that it was providing certain kinds of counseling services, and that its counselors were licensed and qualified to provide those services. Id. But many of the defendant\'s staff were either unlicensed or unqualified. Id. Because the defendant failed to disclose its ""many violations of basic staff and licensing requirements,"" its claims were rendered fraudulently misleading half-truths. Id. at 189-91, 136 S.Ct. 1989.\n\nHere, relying on the same facts and arguments that she used to support her theory of express false certification liability, Ms. Jackson alleges that Defendants are also liable under the implied false certification theory of liability. [Dkt. 17 at 72-74]. For brevity, the Court will not retread the details, contentions, and conclusions discussed above.\n\nThe Court does, however, observe again that Ms. Jackson conceded in her Response that Defendants\' invoices ""were contractually justified"" and did ""not contain false statements,"" but that she made contradictory assertions during oral argument. [Dkt. 65 at 18; Dkt. 94 at 9:7-13:10].\n\nIn short, just as Ms. Jackson fails to identify any expressly false certifications of compliance in Pfizer\'s invoices seeking payment from the DoD, she similarly fails to identify any ""specific representations"" about Pfizer\'s vaccine, or compliance with protocols or regulations, in those invoices. Id. Without a ""specific representation"" alleged anywhere in her lengthy complaint, Ms. Jackson cannot plead an implied certification claim because that theory requires that a ""misleading half-truth"" be submitted to the Government in a claim for payment. See Escobar, 579 U.S. at 190, 136 S.Ct. 1989.\n\nThus, the Amended Complaint does not adequately plead the express or implied presentment of a false claim under § 3729(a)(1)(A).\n\n2. False Record Claims—§ 3729(a)(1)(B)\n\nMs. Jackson\'s second cause of action asserts false record claims against Defendants pursuant to § 3729(a)(1)(B). [Dkt. 17 at 74-75]. She specifically identifies ""the clinical trial protocol Pfizer submitted to the United States and the falsified source documents and data behind Defendants\' trial results and [Emergency Authorization] application"" as false records. Id. at 74. Further, it is the Court\'s understanding that by realleging and incorporating ""all paragraphs"" of her Amended Complaint, Ms. Jackson contends that Pfizer\'s Form FDA-1571 and ICON\'s and Ventavia\'s\n\nForm FDA-1572s also constituted false records. Id. at 76.\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the second cause of action on the theory that § 3729(a)(1)(B) contains a ""double falsity"" requirement: the relator must plead both a false statement and a corresponding false claim. [Dkt. 37 at 31]. In other words, Defendants argue that false records and statements alone do not create liability; there must be an actual false claim seeking payment from the government at the end of the chain. Id. Defendants base their argument on United States v. Southland Mgmt. Corp., 326 F.3d 669, 675 (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc).\n\nIn Southland, the defendants—owners of an apartment project—falsely certified that their property was safe and sanitary in connection with their requests for housing assistance payments from a government-funded program. Id. at 671. Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the defendants could not be held liable for making false records or statements under § 3729(a)(2), now codified at § 3729(a)(1)(B), because the defendants\' claims for payment were contractually justified. Id. at 674-76. In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit held:\n\nAlthough § 3729(a)(2) prohibits the submission of a false record or statement, it does so only when the submission of the record or statement was done in an attempt to get a false claim paid. There is no liability under this Act for a false statement unless it is used to get [a] false claim paid.\n\nId. at 675 (citing Hutchins v. Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer, 253 F.3d 176, 184 (3d Cir. 2001) (noting that the FCA ""was not intended to impose liability for every false statement made to the government"")); see also United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., 336 F.3d 375, 380-81 (5th Cir. 2003) (affirming the district court\'s finding that ""[u]nder section 3729(a)(2), the plaintiff must identify both a false claim and a false record or statement made or used to get that false claim paid""); Thompson, 125 F.3d at 903 (instructing the district court to consider the false statements prong if it determined that the relator properly alleged false claims).\n\nYet that does not end the analysis. This Court must address whether Southland\'s mandate—that a false record claim cannot survive where there cannot be an accompanying false claim for payment—remains valid in light of the Fraud Enforcement & Recovery Act of 2009 (""FERA""). FERA amended several sections of the False Claims Act, including 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(2). Pub. L. No. 111-21, § 386, 123 Stat. 1617, 1621 (2009). The pre-FERA false record provision imposed liability only on those who ""knowingly ma[de], use[d], or cause[d] to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government."" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(2) (2008) (emphasis added). FERA expanded liability to anyone who ""knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim."" Id. § 3729(a)(1)(B).\n\nIn short, FERA replaced § 3729(a)(2)\'s requirement that a false record or statement be made to get a false claim paid by the government itself with a broader standard that permits imposing liability on the use of false records or statements that are made to get false claims paid by government funds, even if the funds are not directly paid by the government. See United States ex rel. Steury v. Cardinal Health Inc., 625 F.3d 262, 267 n.1 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting legislative intent to overrule the Supreme Court\'s holding in Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 553 U.S. 662, 688-69, 128 S.Ct. 2123, 170\n\nL.Ed.2d 1030 (2008) ""that a false record or statement implicated the FCA only when it was made with the specific \'purpose of getting a false or fraudulent claim\' paid by \'the Government itself\'""); United States ex rel. Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc., 747 F. Supp. 2d 745, 764 n.17 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (comparing § 3729(a)(2) with § 3729(a)(1)(B)).\n\nThe conclusion that FERA did not eliminate the need to allege the existence of a false claim for payment is confirmed by the plain text of the amended statute, which prohibits the use of a false record or statement that is ""material to a false or fraudulent claim."" § 3729(a)(1)(B). This presupposes the existence of a claim. United States ex rel. Folliard v. CDW Tech. Servs., Inc., 722 F. Supp. 2d 20, 35 (D.D.C. 2010) (reaching the same conclusion). And a ""claim,"" for present purposes, is defined as a request ""for money."" § 3729(b)(2)(A). A thorough review of Fifth Circuit cases analyzing claims brought under § 3729(a)(1)(B) does not reveal a different conclusion.\n\nThe upshot is that there is no liability under the FCA for making or using a false record or statement where the claimant is entitled to the payment. Southland, 326 F.3d at 675. As discussed above, Pfizer was entitled to its claims for payment. See supra Part III.B.1. Therefore, Ms. Jackson has not stated a claim for false record liability under § 3729(a)(1)(B).\n\n3. Fraudulent Inducement Theory\n\nMs. Jackson asserts, for the first time, in her Response that Defendants are liable under a ""fraudulent inducement"" theory. [Dkt. 65 at 18]. She argues that ""Pfizer\'s invoices, though contractually justified, were fraudulently induced via prior false certifications"" that Defendants ""made to the FDA before receiving [Emergency Authorization]."" Id. According to Ms. Jackson, Pfizer obtained Emergency Authorization for its vaccine through ""lies, omissions, and fabrications"" submitted to the FDA. Id.\n\n""FCA liability may be imposed \'when the contract under which payment is made was procured by fraud.\'"" Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467-68 (quoting Willard, 336 F.3d at 384). ""This type of FCA claim is characterized as fraudulent inducement."" Id. ""Under a fraudulent inducement theory, although the Defendants\' \'subsequent claims for payment made under the contract were not literally false, [because]\n\nthey derived from the original fraudulent misrepresentation, they, too, became actionable false claims.\'"" Id. at 468 (quoting United States ex rel. Laird v. Lockheed Martin Eng\'g & Sci. Servs. Co., 491 F.3d 254, 259 (5th Cir. 2007)). To succeed on a fraudulent inducement theory, a relator must prove that the defendant: (1) had no intention to perform according to the terms of the contract, and (2) obtained payments under the contract that it was not legitimately entitled to. Laird, 491 F.3d at 259.\n\nDefendants contend that it is doubtful whether the ""historical"" Fifth Circuit decisions recognizing the fraudulent inducement theory remain good law. [Dkt. 67 at 9]. According to Defendants, those opinions pre-date the Supreme Court\'s Escobar decision, which instructs lower courts to adhere strictly to the language of the FCA. Id. To support their contention, Defendants cite United States ex rel. Yu v. Grifols USA, LLC, No. 1:17-CV-2226-GHW, 2021 WL 5827047, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2021) (noting that ""there is a significant dearth of support for Relator\'s fraud in the inducement theory regarding FDA approval"" which is ""difficult to square with the plain language of the FCA"").\n\nThe Court does not agree. As recently as 2019—three years after the Escobar decision—the Eastern District of Texas has continued to recognize the fraudulent inducement theory. See Reddell, 2019 WL 12875471, at *10 (""Under a theory of fraudulent inducement, claims for payment that are not literally false may become actionable false claims because they were derived from a contract that was procured by fraud."").\n\nNext, Defendants correctly point out that Ms. Jackson does not allege that Pfizer procured its vaccine contract through false or fraudulent statements. [Dkt. 67 at 7]. Rather, she alleges that after the DoD contracted to purchase Pfizer\'s vaccine, the company obtained Emergency Authorization for its product through ""lies, omission, and fabrications"" submitted to the FDA. [Dkt. 65 at 18]. To the Court\'s knowledge, the Fifth Circuit has not expanded its recognition of the fraudulent inducement theory to situations beyond those where ""the contract under which payment is made was procured by fraud."" Gonzalez v. Fresenius Med. Care N. Am., 689 F.3d 470, 476 (5th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added); Willard, 336 F.3d at 384; Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467-68; Laird, 491 F.3d at 259.\n\nThe Court, however, need not decide whether liability can attach under the fraudulent inducement theory when a contract was procured through truthful statements, but a condition of payment—here, FDA authorization—was subsequently obtained through misrepresentations. As noted above, Ms. Jackson raised this theory for the first time in her response. ""[I]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."" Roebuck v. Dothan Sec., Inc., 515 F. App\'x. 275, 280 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984)). This rule extends to new theories of liability under the same cause of action. Park v. Direct Energy GP, L.L.C., 832 F. App\'x. 288, 295 (5th Cir. 2020) (holding that a new legal theory for Family and Medical Leave Act liability which was not mentioned in the complaint was not properly before the trial court).\n\nThe Court concludes that Ms. Jackson has failed to plead the existence of a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct under § 3729(a)(1)(A) or § 3729(a)(1)(B). Thus, the first element is not satisfied.\n\nC. Materiality\n\nTo be actionable under the FCA, a ""misrepresentation about compliance\n\nwith a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the Government\'s payment decision."" Escobar, 579 U.S. at 181, 136 S.Ct. 1989. ""The materiality standard is demanding,"" and ""cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial."" Id. at 194, 136 S.Ct. 1989. Nor is a violation material just because the government ""would have the option to decline to pay"" if it knew of the noncompliance. Id. Moreover, ""statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements are not automatically material, even if they are labeled conditions of payment."" Id. at 191, 136 S.Ct. 1989.\n\nThe materiality test looks instead to the ""likely or actual behavior"" of the Government. Id. at 193, 136 S.Ct. 1989. Most importantly for this case, ""if the Government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not material."" Id. (emphasis added). This rule applies even at the pleading stage of FCA litigation. Escobar, 579 U.S. at 195 n.6, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (""We reject [the] assertion that materiality is too fact intensive for courts to dismiss False Claims Act cases on a motion to dismiss or at summary judgment.""); United States ex rel. Porter v. Magnolia Health Plan, Inc., 810 F. App\'x 237, 239-40 (5th Cir. 2020) (affirming dismissal of a qui tam complaint for lack of materiality).\n\n1. Payment Despite Knowledge\n\ni. Whose Knowledge Matters?\n\nA threshold issue that this Court must address is whether the FDA\'s knowledge or the DoD\'s knowledge matters when deciding how much weight to give to the Government\'s decision to continue purchasing Pfizer\'s vaccine. The FDA has known of Ms. Jackson\'s allegations since September 2020, months prior to Pfizer submitting its first invoice to the DoD in December 2020. [Dkt. 17 at 69; Dkt. 37-2 at 2]. But the DoD, not the FDA, is the entity that originally purchased Pfizer\'s vaccine. [Dkt. 17-1 at 303]. The well-pleaded facts require drawing the inference that the DoD did not have knowledge of the alleged fraud prior to February 22, 2022, approximately two years after it paid Pfizer\'s first invoice. [Dkt. 17 at 15-16]. Thus, the argument could be made that even though the FDA continues to authorize Pfizer\'s vaccine despite its knowledge of the alleged fraud, the DoD would not have purchased the vaccine if it possessed the same knowledge.\n\nMs. Jackson\'s pleadings do not clarify this issue. In some instances, she asserts, seemingly interchangeably, that the ""DoD,"" id. at 74, ""United States,"" id. at 77, or ""Government,"" [Dkt. 65 at 28], would not have paid Pfizer\'s invoices had it known of the alleged misrepresentations. Elsewhere, she makes arguments concerning\n\nthe ""FDA\'s ongoing payments to [Defendants]."" Id. at 29.\n\nThe answer to this question lies in the Project Agreement. As discussed earlier, the ""Payment"" section of the Statement of Work conditioned payment solely on Pfizer\'s delivery of an FDA authorized or approved vaccine. [Dkt. 17-1 at 319-20]. Critically, that section provides that ""the Government will have no right to withhold payment in any respect of any delivered doses, unless the FDA has withdrawn approval or authorization of the vaccine."" Id. at 320. Put differently, even if the DoD was concerned about potential regulatory or protocol violations, the Project Agreement did not authorize the DoD to decide whether the vaccines were fit for purchase. Instead, the Project Agreement vested this decision-making authority in the FDA. Thus, what matters when evaluating the Government\'s continued purchase of the vaccine is that the FDA granted authorization despite its knowledge of Ms. Jackson\'s allegations.\n\nThe First Circuit\'s opinion in D\'Agostino v. ev3, Inc., 845 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir. 2016) bolsters this reasoning. Post-Escobar, the Fifth Circuit has only directly addressed situations where the government entity that had knowledge of the alleged fraud was the same entity that, despite such knowledge, made the decision to continue payment (or to continue approving federal reimbursement). See, e.g., United States ex rel. Harman v. Trinity Indus. Inc., 872 F.3d 645, 668-69 (5th Cir. 2017); Porter, 810 F. App\'x at 243. The Fifth Circuit, however, looked to the First Circuit\'s reasoning in D\'Agostino for ""guidance on the impact of the government\'s continued payment."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 661-62.\n\nIn D\'Agostino, the relator alleged that a medical device manufacturer ""made three fraudulent representations to the FDA in seeking approval"" to market a device to treat malformed blood vessels in the brain. 845 F.3d at 3, 7. The relator further alleged that the defendants\' misrepresentations ""could have influenced the FDA to grant that approval,"" which was a ""precondition"" to reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for use of the device. Id. at 7. Applying Escobar, the First Circuit affirmed dismissal of the complaint, writing that ""[t]he fact that [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid] ha[ve] not denied reimbursement for [the device] in the wake of [the relator\'s] allegations casts serious doubt on the materiality of the fraudulent misrepresentations that [the relator alleges]."" Id. at 7.\n\nThe First Circuit then turned from materiality to causation, explaining that because the FDA approved the device notwithstanding the relator\'s allegations of fraudulent representations—and did not withdraw its approval in the years that followed—the connection between the representations to the FDA and a payment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid relying on FDA approval disappeared. Id. at 8. The Fifth Circuit in Harman explained that although ""the [First Circuit] was addressing the causation element, given the conceptual juncture points of materiality and causation, its cautions remain forceful in the materiality context...."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 661-62 (citing D\'Agostino, 845 F.3d at 8).\n\nHere, the FDA\'s continued approval of Pfizer\'s vaccine, despite Ms. Jackson\'s allegations, breaks any connection between the alleged misrepresentations to the FDA and DoD\'s payment conditioned on FDA approval. Thus, it is the FDA\'s knowledge that matters for deciding materiality. The Court now addresses the reasons why the Amended Complaint does not support a conclusion that Defendants\' alleged misrepresentations were material. ii. Continued Authorization and Payment\n\n""[T]hough not dispositive, continued payment by the federal government after it learns of the alleged fraud substantially increases the burden on the relator in establishing materiality."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 663.\n\nIn Porter, the Fifth Circuit affirmed dismissal of an FCA complaint on materiality grounds. 810 F. App\'x at 241-42. In doing so, the court highlighted the fact that the Mississippi Division of Medicaid ""took no action"" after learning of the relator\'s allegations of fraud and instead ""continued payment and renewed its contract with [the defendant] several times."" Id. at 242; see also United States ex rel. Nargol v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., 865 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2017) (holding that ""it is not plausible that the conduct of the manufacturer in securing FDA approval constituted a material falsehood capable of proximately causing the payment of a claim"" when ""an agency armed with robust investigatory powers to protect public health and safety [was] told what Relators [had] to say, yet [saw] no reason to change its position"").\n\nHere, Ms. Jackson argues that the FDA was the victim of ""fraud."" [Dkt. 65 at 9-10]. But the well-pleaded facts in her Amended Complaint do not support this conclusion. The FDA has known about Ms. Jackson\'s allegations since September 25, 2020. [Dkt. 17 at 69]. Despite this knowledge, between December 11, 2020, and October 29, 2021, the FDA issued three Emergency Authorizations of Pfizer\'s vaccine for individuals of various age groups. Id. at 9. And on August 23, 2021, the FDA fully approved Pfizer\'s vaccine by granting a Biologistic License Application. Id. To this day, the FDA has not revoked its approval of Pfizer\'s vaccine, and the Government continues to provide the vaccine to all citizens free of charge. Id. at 18 n.2. The Government\'s unbroken chain of authorization and payments in the face of Ms. Jackson\'s allegations does not support an inference that the alleged misrepresentations were material.\n\nThis Court\'s conclusion is reinforced by the Fifth Circuit\'s recent decision in Harman. In Harman, the relator alleged that a modified guardrail system designed by the defendants was causing highway accidents. 872 F.3d at 649. The relator presented his findings to the Federal Highway Administration, which after considering all of the facts, issued an official memorandum explaining that the guardrail was safe and that states that purchased the guardrail could continue to seek federal reimbursement. Id. at 649-51. Despite this memorandum, the district court permitted the relator\'s qui tam action to proceed to trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the relator. Id. at 651.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 670. The court did not even need to infer the Government\'s approval from continued payment because the Government\'s memorandum explicitly stated approval. Id. at 663-64. Relevant to the instant case, the Fifth Circuit placed great emphasis on the ""gravity"" of the Government\'s decision:\n\nThis system was installed throughout the United States, and the government\'s rejection of [the relator\'s] assertions, if in error, risked the lives on our nation\'s highways, not just undue expense. Where violations of the ""certain requirements"" described by Escobar involve potential for horrific loss of life and limb, the government has strong incentives to reject nonconforming products, and Escobar\'s cautions have particular bite when deployed to decisions as here.\n\nId. at 663. The court further observed that in rejecting the relator\'s ""views and proofs, [the government] balances the federal fisc, motorist safety, and other factors."" Id. at 669. ""Such decision making is policy making, not the task of a seven-person jury—such a result confounds the premise of qui tam actions: that the government was the victim."" Id.\n\nThe same reasoning applies here. As the Amended Complaint notes, developing a safe and effective vaccine was a matter of national urgency: the approval of an unsafe vaccine could have put millions of Americans at risk. [Dkt. 17 at 6]. Accordingly, the FDA\'s review process before granting Emergency Authorization included a ""public and independent review"" as well as ""a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality information."" Id. at 25 n.5. Moreover, the United States itself has taken the unusual step of filing a Statement of Interest Supporting Dismissal of the Amended Complaint. [Dkt. 70].\n\nMs. Jackson disagrees with the FDA\'s decision to authorize Pfizer\'s vaccine. Congress, however, ""enacted the FCA to vindicate fraud on the federal government, not second guess decisions made by those empowered through the democratic process to shape public policy."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 668-69. ""When the government, at appropriate levels, repeatedly concludes that it has not been defrauded, it is not forgiving a found fraud—rather it is concluding that there was no fraud at all."" Id. at 670.\n\niii. Alternative Explanations for Continued Approval and Payment\n\nMs. Jackson argues that the Government\'s ongoing payments to Pfizer is ""an irrelevant factor because"" the Government ""had virtually no power to withhold payment under the DoD\'s contract with Pfizer."" [Dkt. 65 at 29]. She is referring to the provision of the Statement of Work that requires the Government to pay for ""delivered doses"" unless and until the FDA withdraws ""approval or authorization of the vaccine."" [Dkt. 17-1 at 320]. This argument ignores reality.\n\nThe Government itself, through the DoD, negotiated the contract provisions in question. And the Government itself, through the FDA, controls the vaccine\'s regulatory status. Id. at 303-05, 320. When it comes to the vaccine, the Government holds all the cards; its continued authorization, approval, and purchases of the vaccine are unquestionably relevant to materiality.\n\nMs. Jackson also asks the Court to disregard the Government\'s continued payments because there are ""numerous reasons unrelated to materiality why the [G]overnment might continue doing business with a contractor despite allegations of fraud."" [Dkt. 65 at 31]. She argues that ""[g]iven the difference between alleged fraud and actual fraud, the Government may not want to prematurely end a relationship with a contractor over unproven\n\nallegations."" Id. at 30. But Pfizer and the Government\'s relationship is no longer ""premature."" The Government has been aware of Ms. Jackson\'s allegations for several years, has granted Emergency Authorization multiple times, and to this day continues to authorize and provide Pfizer\'s vaccine at no cost. [Dkt. 17 at 9, 18 n.2, 69-70].\n\nNext, she posits that the Government may have been ""forced to rely on [Pfizer] for essential goods and services."" [Dkt. 65 at 30]. She hypothesizes that, in this case, ""the significant resources already expended"" on the clinical trial, along with ""the likely lack of other sponsors who could undertake the operation,"" may explain why the Government ""could not divert course"" once she came forward with her concerns. Id. at 31-32. The well-pleaded facts provide no support for this speculation. Pfizer funded the clinical trial, not the Government. [Dkt. 17-1 at 312]. It is implausible that the Government would purchase an ineffective or unsafe vaccine simply because Pfizer spent a lot of money developing it. It is similarly unreasonable to suggest that a ""lack of other sponsors"" forced the Government\'s hand, especially when many manufacturers besides Pfizer were attempting to develop their own vaccine at the time, which two of them—Moderna and J&J—did successfully. Id. at 18 n.2.\n\n""[C]ontinued payment by the federal government after it learns of the alleged fraud substantially increases the burden on the relator in establishing materiality."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 663. The well-pleaded facts in Ms. Jackson\'s Amended Complaint cannot plausibly shoulder that burden.\n\n2. The Government\'s Actual Behavior\n\nAccording to Ms. Jackson, ""[a]ll that is required under the test for materiality ... is that the false or fraudulent statements have the potential to influence the [G]overnment\'s decisions."" [Dkt. 65 at 27] (quoting Longhi, 575 F.3d at 470). She also argues that if an ""objective FDA, without conflicts of interest,"" saw the alleged fraud, it would not have authorized Pfizer\'s vaccine. Id. at 17, 28. Her contention is unavailing.\n\nThe Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit have expounded Longhi\'s ""potential to influence"" test that Ms. Jackson relies on. ""Under any understanding of the concept, materiality \'look[s] to the effect on the likely or actual behavior of the recipient of the alleged misrepresentation,\'"" Escobar, 579 U.S. at 193, 136 S.Ct. 1989, and courts ""should not ignore what actually occurred"" when they ""have the benefit of hindsight,"" Harman, 872 F.3d at 667-68. Hindsight here is 20/20. The FDA has been aware of Ms. Jackson\'s concerns since September 2020. [Dkt. 17 at 69]. The FDA, which is an agency with ""robust investigatory powers to protect the public health and safety,"" Nargol, 865 F.3d at 35, authorized Pfizer\'s vaccine for emergency use, and later granted full approval. [Dkt. 17 at 9, 25]. Those regulatory decisions remain in place and, accordingly, the Government continues to purchase the vaccine. Id. at 18 n.2.\n\n3. Safety and Efficacy of the Vaccine\n\nIn explaining the FCA materiality standard, the Supreme Court observed that under contract law, a term may be material if it ""went to the very essence of the bargain."" Escobar, 579 U.S. at 193 n.5, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (quoting Junius Constr. Co. v. Cohen, 257 N.Y. 393, 400, 178 N.E. 672 (1931)). Ms. Jackson argues that Emergency Authorization—being the sole condition of payment—went to the ""essence of the bargain"" between Pfizer and the Government, which at its core was the delivery of\n\na ""safe and effective"" vaccine. [Dkt. 65 at 28-29]. She posits that by bypassing trial protocol to secure Emergency Authorization, the Defendants ""destroy[ed] the very essence of the bargain."" Id. at 29.\n\nAbsent from the Amended Complaint, however, are factual allegations indicating that the alleged violations at the Ventavia sites resulted in the FDA receiving fabricated, inaccurate, or misleading data about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine. The Amended Complaint does not, for example, identify any safety risk that was hidden from the FDA in the data from the Ventavia sites, any symptomatic participants who Ventavia did not properly test for COVID-19 infection, or any COVID-19 infections in vaccinated participants that Ventavia falsely reported to have occurred in the placebo group. See, e.g., [Dkt. 17 at 38] (alleging that Ventavia did not test a participant for COVID-19 until after the vaccine was administered without alleging that the participant was COVID-19 positive and should have been excluded from the trial); id. at 42-43 (alleging that Ventavia likely misrepresented the time that participants\' vital signs were taken to conceal the fact that vitals were taken before or during the informed consent process without alleging that informed consent was never obtained or providing any factual basis to conclude that the timing of informed consent could impact the evaluation of the vaccine\'s safety or efficacy); id. at 48-49 (alleging that Ventavia failed to report AEs to Pfizer and ICON without describing or identifying any particular AE that was not properly reported); id. at 49, 52 (alleging that Ventavia delayed in implementing a symptom review log but neglecting to mention that symptoms were recorded in participants\' electronic diaries as pleaded elsewhere in the Amended Complaint); id. at 50 (alleging deviations in blood sample clotting, centrifuge, and freezing times without pleading facts indicating whether or how those alleged deviations could affect the evaluation of the blood samples or the measure of safety or efficacy of the vaccine); id. at 51 (alleging that a Ventavia employee changed a participant\'s blood reading without explaining how the reading was changed or what impact, if any, the change could have on the safety or efficacy of the results). Indeed, the only SAE specifically identified in the Amended Complaint—a participant\'s positive pregnancy test after receiving her first vaccine dose—was reported and faxed to Pfizer. [Dkt. 17-2 at 31-32]\n\nFurthermore, materiality ""cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial."" Harman, 872 F.3d at 660 (quoting Escobar, 579 U.S. at 194, 136 S.Ct. 1989). Even if Ms. Jackson\'s allegations could support an inference that Ventavia\'s safety and efficacy data was unreliable, a conclusion that the Emergency Authorization criteria would not have been met without the Ventavia data is implausible considering that authorization was based on ""the totality of available scientific evidence,"" [Dkt. 17-1 at 312; Dkt. 37 at 11 n.5], and Ventavia only enrolled about 3%—approximately 1,500 of nearly 44,000—of the total clinical trial participants. [Dkt. 17 at 7, 24]. Furthermore, Ms. Jackson\'s allegations only implicate a fraction of that 3%.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the well-pleaded facts in Ms. Jackson\'s Amended Complaint cannot support a conclusion that Defendants\' alleged fraud was material.\n\nIn conclusion, Ms. Jackson has not met her burden of pleading that Defendants made false statements or engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct, or that their alleged misrepresentations were material. Longhi, 575 F.3d at 467. Both deficiencies\n\nare independently fatal to her presentment claim and her false record claim. Thus, the Court dismisses Ms. Jackson\'s first cause of action under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A) and second cause of action under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(B).\n\nD. Leave to Amend\n\nMs. Jackson requests leave to file a Second Amended Complaint in the event that the Court finds her Amended Complaint insufficient to state a claim for relief. [Dkt. 65 at 44]. She seeks to include the following: (1) allegations of ""Pfizer\'s interference with medical charting""; (2) further explanation ""on widespread unblinding""; (3) ""additional outcome data on mRNA injection benefits, or lack thereof, and additional allegations as to misbranding""; (4) citations to ""individual patient or source documents which show trial data pertaining to inclusion or exclusion data was falsified""; and (5) allegations of record retention protocol violations. Id.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) states that a court ""should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). While the language of Rule 15(a) ""evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend,"" Smith v. EMC Corp., 393 F.3d 590, 598 (5th Cir. 2004) (quoting Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863 (5th Cir. 2003)), district courts may deny leave to amend if amendment would be futile. Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., LLC, 234 F.3d 863, 872-73 (5th Cir. 2000). An amendment is considered futile if ""the amended complaint would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted."" Id. at 873.\n\nIn Porter, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\'s dismissal with prejudice where the district court found that amendment would be futile. See 810 F. App\'x at 241-43 (affirming that amendment would be futile because the lack of contractual language requiring compliance with the regulations that the defendant allegedly violated, and the Government\'s continued payment after learning of the relator\'s allegations, showed that the defendant\'s alleged misconduct was not material).\n\nHere, Ms. Jackson seeks to allege additional regulatory violations. The Court already determined that Ms. Jackson failed to satisfy the first element of an FCA claim—that Defendants made false statements or engaged in a false or fraudulent course of conduct. Pleading additional regulatory violations will not remedy her inability to plead that Defendants made false statements or engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct. Moreover, the proposed amendments would not alter the conclusion that Defendants\' alleged fraud was not material in light of the Government\'s continued authorization and purchase of the vaccine.\n\nBased on these considerations, amendment would be futile. The Court denies Ms. Jackson\'s request for leave to amend. Her presentment claim under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A) and false record claim under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(B) are dismissed with prejudice.\n\nIV. RETALIATION CLAIM\n\nMs. Jackson alleges that ""in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h),"" Ventavia ""retaliated\n\nagainst [her] as a result of her efforts to stop Defendants from committing violations of the False Claims Act."" [Dkt. 17 at 78]. Specifically, she alleges that Ventavia punished her with harassment and termination for engaging in statutorily protected activity and that she has suffered economic loss and emotional harm as a result. Id.\n\n""The \'whistleblower\' provision of the False Claims Act prevents the harassment, retaliation, or threatening of employees who assist in or bring qui tam actions."" Robertson v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 32 F.3d 948, 951 (5th Cir. 1994). The statute provides:\n\nAny employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or associated others in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3730(h)(1). ""To establish a claim under § 3730(h), a party must show (1) that she was engaged in protected activity with respect to the False Claims Act; (2) that her employer knew she was engaged in protected activity; and (3) that she was discharged because she was engaged in protected activity."" Thomas v. ITT Educ. Servs., Inc., 517 F. App\'x 259, 262 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Robertson, 32 F.3d at 951).\n\n""A protected activity is one motivated by a concern regarding fraud against the government."" Id.; United States ex rel. Johnson v. Kaner Med. Grp., P.A., 641 F. App\'x 391, 395 (5th Cir. 2016) (""To qualify as protected activity under the whistleblower provision, the activity must be \'in furtherance of\' uncovering fraud or potential fraud against the Government."") (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h)(1)). Mere criticism by an employee of the employer\'s methods of conducting business, ""without any suggestion that the [employee] was attempting to expose illegality or fraud within the meaning of the FCA, does not rise to the level of protected activity."" United States ex rel. Patton v. Shaw Servs., L.L.C., 418 F. App\'x 366, 372 (5th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added).\n\nHere, beginning on September 8, 2020—the day Ms. Jackson began her employment at Ventavia—she reported ""on a near-daily basis"" to Ventavia management that ""patient safety and the integrity of the [Pfizer] vaccine trial was at risk."" [Dkt. 17 at 61]. She goes on to allege that throughout her eighteen days of employment, she regularly reported violations of trial protocol, FDA regulations, and HIPAA to Ventavia management. Id. at 61-69.\n\nWhen she asked Houston Regional Director, Ms. Downs, and Quality Control Director, Mr. Jones, about what would happen if the FDA audited Ventavia, both expressed concern that Ventavia would receive warning letters or be asked to discontinue trial enrollment. Id. at 65. Ms. Jackson reiterated this message to other members of Ventavia management, explaining that ""the FDA would likely issue warning letters against Ventavia if it visited or audited the trial sites"" and recommended that Ventavia stop enrollment. Id.\n\nOn September 24, 2020, Ms. Jackson met with Mr. Jones and Ventavia\'s Director of Operations, Ms. Fisher. Id. at 68. During the meeting, Ms. Jackson again noted her concerns about safety issues, HIPAA violations, unblinding, and FDA\n\nregulatory violations. Id. at 68-69. At some point during the meeting, she told Mr. Jones and Ms. Fisher to ""get on google and search for FDA warning letters."" Id. at 69.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Jackson called the FDA\'s hotline and reported ""the clinical trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns that she witnessed."" Id. Ventavia fired Ms. Jackson later that day. Id. Shortly after her termination, the FDA reached out to Ms. Jackson and ""spoke to her for several hours regarding the violations she witnessed at Ventavia."" Id. at 70.\n\nThe well-pleaded facts in the Amended Complaint do not support a conclusion that Ms. Jackson engaged in protected activity. At no point does she allege that she was concerned about, or alerted Ventavia or the FDA to, potential ""fraud against the government."" Thomas, 517 F. App\'x at 262. Rather, she alleges that she complained about participant safety and regulatory, protocol, and HIPAA violations. But that is not protected activity under the FCA\'s retaliation provision—internal complaints about patient safety, or protocol and regulatory violations, are not the same thing as complaining about defrauding the Government. Patton, 418 F. App\'x at 372.\n\nIn her Response to Ventavia\'s Motion to Dismiss, Ms. Jackson asks the Court to rely on out-of-circuit authorities that impose different standards for protected activity than the Fifth Circuit. [Dkt. 65 at 36-37]. It would be improper, however, to go outside the Fifth Circuit because its caselaw is clear: for internal reports to be protected under the FCA, the relator must have raised concerns about fraud on the government—not merely criticized the company\'s business practices. Patton, 418 F. App\'x at 372.\n\nMs. Jackson also argues that her conduct amounted to protected activity in light of FERA\'s 2009 revisions to the FCA. [Dkt. 65 at 38-39]. The Court disagrees. Pre-FERA, the FCA\'s antiretaliation provision prohibited retaliation against an employee ""because of lawful acts done by the employee ... in furtherance of an action under this section."" 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h) (2009) (emphasis added). FERA broadened the scope of protected activity to include ""lawful acts done by an employee ... in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter."" Id. § 3730(h) (emphasis added).\n\nThe amendment clarifies that a relator need not have acted with the purpose of bringing a qui tam lawsuit for her activity to be protected. See Melchior v. Apple Homecare Med. Supply, Inc., No. A-16-CV-1301-RP, 2018 WL 1876287, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 8, 2018) (""[W]hile the court agrees that the law does require an internal whistleblower\'s complaints to clearly convey that the concerns focus on fraud against the federal government, the law does not require that acts be in furtherance of an actual qui tam action...."") (emphasis added). As a matter of text, the amended statute still requires an effort to stop ""violations of this subchapter."" 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).\n\nThe Fifth Circuit addressed the amended statute in Thomas and still noted that the protected activity must be ""motivated by a concern regarding fraud against the government."" 517 F. App\'x at 262; see also Reddell, 2019 WL 12875471, at *16 (applying the amended statute and holding that internal reports are protected only ""if they raise concerns about fraud instead of merely criticizing the underlying subject""); Guerrero v. Total Renal Care, Inc., No. EP-11-CV-449-KC, 2012 WL 899228, at *5 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 12, 2012) (observing that\n\neven post-FERA, ""in order to constitute protected conduct, an employee\'s internal report must specifically allege fraudulent claims for federal funds and not merely address concerns about general misconduct""); United States ex rel. Ligai v. ETS-Lindgren Inc., Civil Action No. H-112973, 2014 WL 4649885, at *17 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2014) (same), aff\'d sub nom. United States ex rel. Ligai v. ESCO Techs., Inc., 611 F. App\'x 219 (5th Cir. 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, Ms. Jackson did not engage in protected activity. Further, her claim also fails because nowhere in the Amended Complaint does she allege the second element of a FCA retaliation claim—that Ventavia knew she was engaged in protected activity. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Ms. Jackson\'s retaliation claim under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h) without prejudice.\n\nThe Court observes, however, that while Ms. Jackson has failed to state a claim for retaliation under the FCA, she may be able to bring her claim under another statute. The Court does not opine on the likelihood of success with respect to asserting retaliation under a different statute.\n\nV.

For the policy in China, see Chinese government response to COVID-19 § Zero-COVID policy.\n\nZero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and ""Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support"" (FTTIS), was a public health policy implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][a] In contrast to the ""living with COVID-19"" strategy, the zero-COVID strategy was purportedly one ""of control and maximum suppression"".[1] Public health measures used to implement the strategy included as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it was detected. The goal of the strategy was to get the area back to zero new infections and resume normal economic and social activities.[1][4]\n\nA zero-COVID strategy consisted of two phases: an initial suppression phase in which the virus is eliminated locally using aggressive public health measures, and a sustained containment phase, in which normal economic and social activities resume and public health measures are used to contain new outbreaks before they spread widely.[4] This strategy was utilized to varying degrees by Australia, Bhutan,[5][6] Atlantic and Northern Canada,[7] mainland China, Hong Kong,[8] Macau,[9] Malaysia,[10] Montserrat, New Zealand, North Korea, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Scotland,[11] South Korea,[12] Taiwan,[13] East Timor, Thailand, Tonga,[14] and Vietnam.[15][16] By late 2021, due to challenges with the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants, and also the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, many countries had phased out zero-COVID, with mainland China being the last major country to do so in December 2022.[17]\n\nExperts have differentiated between zero-COVID, which was an elimination strategy, and mitigation strategies that attempted to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerated some level of transmission within the community.[18][4] These initial strategies could be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity.[19]\n\nAdvocates of zero-COVID pointed to the far lower death rates and higher economic growth in countries that pursued elimination during the first year of the pandemic (i.e., prior to widespread vaccination) compared with countries that pursued mitigation,[18] and argued that swift, strict measures to eliminate the virus allowed a faster return to normal life.[18] Opponents of zero-COVID argued that, similar to the challenges faced with the flu or the common cold, achieving the complete elimination of a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2 may not have been a realistic goal.[20] To achieve zero-COVID in an area with high infection rates, one review estimated that it would take three months of strict lockdown.[21]\n\nElimination vs. mitigation\n\n[edit]\n\nEpidemiologists have differentiated between two broad strategies for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigation and elimination.[4][22][23] Mitigation strategies (also commonly known as ""flattening the curve"") aimed to reduce the growth of an epidemic and to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened, yet still accepted a level of ongoing viral transmission within the community.[4] By contrast, elimination strategies (commonly known as ""zero-COVID"") aimed to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community, which was seen as the optimal way to allow the resumption of normal social and economic activity.[4] In comparison with mitigation strategies, elimination involved stricter short-term measures to completely eliminate the virus, followed by milder long-term measures to prevent a return of the virus.[4][22]\n\nAfter elimination of COVID-19 from a region, zero-COVID strategies required stricter border controls in order to prevent reintroduction of the virus, more rapid identification of new outbreaks, and better contact tracing to end new outbreaks.[22] Advocates of zero-COVID argued that the costs of these measures were lower than the economic and social costs of long-term social distancing measures and increased mortality incurred by mitigation strategies.[22][4]\n\nThe long-term ""exit path"" for both elimination and mitigation strategies depended on the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.[22][4][24]\n\nContainment measures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID approach aimed to prevent viral transmission using a number of different measures, including vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and quarantine. Successful containment or suppression reduced the basic reproduction number of the virus below the critical threshold.[23] Different combinations of measures were used during the initial containment phase, when the virus was first eliminated from a region; and the sustained containment phase, when the goal was to prevent reestablishment of viral transmission within the community.[25]\n\nLockdowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nLockdowns encompassed measures such as closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and movement restrictions.[25] During lockdowns, governments were typically required to supply basic necessities to households.[25][4] Lockdown measures were commonly used to achieve initial containment of the virus.[25] In China, lockdowns of specific high-risk communities were also sometimes used to suppress new outbreaks.[4]\n\nQuarantine for travelers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to prevent reintroduction of the virus into zero-COVID regions after initial containment had been achieved, quarantine for incoming travelers was commonly used. As each infected traveler could seed a new outbreak, the goal of travel quarantine was to intercept the largest possible percentage of infected travelers.[25][26]\n\nInternational flights to China were heavily restricted, and incoming travelers were required to undergo PCR testing and quarantine in designated hotels and facilities.[27] In order to facilitate quarantine for travelers, China constructed specialized facilities at its busiest ports of entry, including Guangzhou and Xiamen.[25] New Zealand and Australia also established managed isolation and quarantine facilities for incoming travelers.[26]\n\nThrough November 2020, border quarantine measures prevented nearly 4,000 infected international travelers from entering the wider community within China.[28] Each month, hundreds of travelers who tested negative before flying to China subsequently tested positive while undergoing quarantine after arrival.[25]\n\nMain article: Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing involved identifying people who have been exposed to (or ""came into close contact with"") an infected person. Public health workers then isolated the known infected person and attempted to locate all of those exposed persons, and quarantine them until they either were unlikely to be infectious or received several negative tests. Various studies argued that early detection and isolation of infected people was the single most effective measure for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[25][4] ""Quarantine"" referred to the separation of exposed persons who could have possibly been infected from the rest of society, while ""isolation"" referred to the separation of persons who were known to be infected.[29]\n\nIn China, when an infected person was identified, all close contacts were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine alongside multiple rounds of PCR testing.[28] In order to minimize the risk that these close contacts posed for outbreak containment, China implemented quarantine in centralized facilities for those deemed to be at the highest-risk of infection.[25] Secondary close contacts (contacts of close contacts) are sometimes required to quarantine at home.[25]\n\nThe widespread use of smartphones enabled more rapid ""digital"" contact tracing. In China, ""health code"" applications were used to facilitate the identification of close contacts, via analysis of Bluetooth logs which show proximity between devices.[4] Taiwan also made use of digital contact tracing, notably to locate close contacts of passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of an early outbreak in February 2020.[30]\n\nRoutine testing of key populations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 testing\n\nIn China, routine PCR testing was carried out on all patients who present with fever or respiratory symptoms.[28] In addition, various categories of workers, such as medical staff and workers who handle imported goods, were regularly tested.[28]\n\nIn China, routine testing of key populations identified index patients in a number of outbreaks, including outbreaks in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, and Manchuria.[25] In some cases, index patients had been discovered while asymptomatic, limiting the amount of onward transmission into the community.[25]\n\nCommunity-wide screening\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 surveillance\n\nAn additional tool for identifying cases outside of known transmission chains was community-wide screening, in which populations of specific neighborhoods or cities were PCR tested. In China, community-wide PCR testing was carried out during outbreaks in order to identify infected people, including those without symptoms or known contact with infected people.[28] Community-wide screening was intended to rapidly isolate infected people from the general population, and to allow a quicker return to normal economic activity.[28] China first carried out community-wide screening from 14 May to 1 June 2020 in Wuhan, and used this technique in subsequent outbreaks.[28] In outbreaks in June 2020 in Beijing and July 2020 in Dalian, community screening identified 26% and 22% of infections, respectively.[25] In order to test large populations quickly, China commonly used pooled testing, combining five to ten samples before testing, and retesting all individuals in each batch that tested positive.[25]\n\nZero-COVID implementation by region\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020, in Victoria, when a man who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the virus.[31] A human biosecurity emergency was declared on 18 March 2020. Australian borders were closed to all non-residents on 20 March,[32] and returning residents were required to spend two weeks in supervised quarantine hotels from 27 March.[33] Many individual states and territories also closed their borders to varying degrees, with some remaining closed until late 2020,[34] and continuing to periodically close during localised outbreaks.[35]\n\nSocial distancing rules were introduced on 21 March, and state governments started to close ""non-essential"" services.[36][37] ""Non-essential services"" included social gathering venues such as pubs and clubs but unlike many other countries did not include most business operations such as construction, manufacturing and many retail categories.[38]\n\nDuring the second wave of May and June 2020, Victoria underwent a second strict lockdown with the use of helicopters and the Army to help the police enforce the Zero-COVID lockdown, which would become a norm of deployment, such as during the COVID-19 Delta variant outbreak in Sydney a year later.[39][40] The wave ended with zero new cases being recorded on 26 October 2020.[41][42][43] Distinctive aspects of that response included early interventions to reduce reflected transmission from countries other than China during late January and February 2020; early recruitment of a large contact tracing workforce;[44] comparatively high public trust in government responses to the pandemic, at least compared to the United States;[45] and later on, the use of short, intense lockdowns to facilitate exhaustive contact tracing of new outbreaks.[46][47] Australia\'s international borders also remained largely closed, with limited numbers of strictly controlled arrivals, for the duration of the pandemic.[48] Australia sought to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app that does not use the privacy-preserving Exposure Notification framework supported natively by Android and Apple smartphones, and while these efforts were not particularly effective,[49][50][51] QR code–based contact tracing apps became ubiquitous in Australia\'s businesses.[52][53][54]\n\nIn July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet unveiled plans to live with COVID and end lockdowns and restrictions contingent on high vaccine uptake.[55] By August 2021, amid outbreaks in New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT, Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a return to Zero-COVID was highly unlikely.[56] Over the following months, each Australian jurisdiction began a living with COVID strategy either through ending lockdowns or voluntarily allowing the virus to enter by opening borders.[57][58]\n\nBhutan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan\n\nAs of January 2022, Bhutan was following a Zero-COVID strategy. The country enforced lockdowns on districts (dzongkhags) whenever local cases of COVID-19 were detected, and health personnel isolated elderly people and others with comorbidities who were in close contact with those COVID-19 cases.[5] However, the Omicron variant challenged Bhutan\'s elimination strategy, and the country abandoned it in mid-April, instead focusing on hospitalization rates.[6]\n\nCanada (Atlantic and Northern)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Atlantic Bubble\n\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on 27 January 2020, after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on 5 March.[59] In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada\'s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses and restrictions on entry with Atlantic Canada and the three Canadian Territories adopting a COVID-Zero approach.[60] On 24 June 2020, it was announced that the four Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had come to an agreement of creating a free-travel bubble while maintaining low case numbers inside, effective 3 July 2020.[61][62] In late November 2020, mounting cases led to the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble,[63] with each of the Atlantic provinces maintaining their own travel restrictions and Zero-COVID policies after the bubble burst.[64] Throughout 2020 and 2021, infection rates and deaths in the Atlantic provinces remained low, especially compared to the more populated areas of Canada which did not implement COVID-Zero.[60] The appearance of the Delta and Omicron variants led to the successive abandonment of COVID-Zero in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2021.[64]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nMainland\n\n[edit]\n\nChina was the first country to experience the COVID-19 pandemic. The first cluster of pneumonia patients was discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019.[66]\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the Chinese government banned travel to and from Wuhan, and began implementing strict lockdowns in Wuhan and other cities throughout China.[66] These measures suppressed transmission of the virus below the critical threshold, bringing the basic reproduction number of the virus to near zero.[66] On 4 February 2020, around two weeks after the beginning of the lockdowns in Hubei province, case counts peaked in the province and began to decline thereafter.[66] The outbreak remained largely concentrated within Hubei province, with over 80% of cases nationwide through 22 March 2020 occurring there.[27]\n\nThe death toll in China during the initial outbreak was approximately 4,600 according to official figures (equivalent to 3.2 deaths per million population),[67] and has been estimated at under 5,000 by a scientific study of excess pneumonia mortality published in The BMJ.[68]\n\nAs the epidemic receded, the focus shifted towards restarting economic activity and preventing a resurgence of the virus.[69] Low- and medium-risk areas of the country began to ease social distancing measures on 17 February 2020.[69] Reopening was accompanied by an increase in testing and the development of electronic ""health codes"" (using smartphone applications) to facilitate contact tracing.[69] Health code applications contain personalized risk information, based on recent contacts and test results.[69] Wuhan, the last major city to reopen, ended its lockdown on 8 April 2020.[70]\n\nChina reported its first imported COVID-19 case from an incoming traveler on 30 January 2020.[69] As the number of imported cases rose and the number of domestic cases fell, China began imposing restrictions on entry into the country.[69] Inbound flights were restricted, and all incoming passengers were required to undergo quarantine.[69]\n\nAfter the containment of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) argued, ""The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works.""[4] The China CDC rejected a mitigation strategy, and instead explained that ""[t]he current strategic goal is to maintain no or minimal indigenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 until the population is protected through immunisation with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, at which time the risk of COVID-19 from any source should be at a minimum. This strategy buys time for urgent development of vaccines and treatments in an environment with little ongoing morbidity and mortality.""[4]\n\nSince the end of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there have been additional, smaller outbreaks caused by imported cases, which have been controlled through short-term, localized intense public health measures.[70] From July through August 2021, China experienced and contained 11 outbreaks of the Delta variant, with a total of 1,390 detected cases (out of a population of 1.4 billion in mainland China).[71] The largest of these outbreaks, in both geographic extent and in the number of people infected, began in Nanjing.[71] The index case of the outbreak, an airport worker, tested positive on 20 July 2021, and the outbreak was traced back to an infected passenger on a flight from Moscow that had arrived on 10 July.[71] The outbreak spread to multiple provinces before it was contained, with a total of 1,162 detected infections.[71] China made use of mass testing to control several outbreaks. For example, nearly the entire population of the city of Guangzhou—approximately 18 million residents—were tested over the course of three days in June 2021, during a Delta variant outbreak.[72]\n\nIn 2022, China faced unprecedented waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant and subvariants, with daily cases reaching record highs in the thousands—levels not seen at any prior point in the pandemic.[73] Similar zero-COVID measures were deployed in some areas with lockdowns in Shenzhen,[74] Shenyang[75] and Jilin.[75] Other areas such as Shanghai had previously adopted a less strict approach avoiding wholesale lockdowns,[76][77] only to issue a snap lockdown in late March due to rapidly rising case counts.[78] Since 1 April, most areas of Shanghai had instituted ""area-separated control"".[79] This is widely considered to be the largest lockdown event in China since Hubei in early 2020.[80] These measures have seen some rare pushback from residents over the overzealousness of the implementation and the perceived lack of benefit.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\nNationwide protests broke out in late November 2022 amid growing discontent among residents over the zero-COVID policy after the 2022 Ürümqi fire and the resulting economic costs.[86] According to The Guardian, global health experts generally agreed that zero-COVID was ""unsustainable"" in the long term.[87] Paul Hunter, professor of the University of East Anglia said that the vaccines approved in China were not as protective as the main Western vaccines, that vaccination and booster rates for the elderly were too low, and that any lifting of restrictions should be incremental to avoid overwhelming hospitals.[88] In response to the protests, the government loosened and overhauled many of its rules, including detention for people who test positive and compulsory PCR tests, on December 7, 2022.[89][90][91] On 12 December, the Chinese government announced it was taking offline one of the main health code apps, which was key in tracking people\'s travel history to identify whether they had been to high-risk areas.[92][93] Due to this, many sources reported that China\'s zero-COVID policy had effectively ended.[94][95][96] China\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy, which aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, was one of the strictest, longest-lasting COVID-19 policies in the world.\n\nHong Kong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020.[97] On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some experts believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections rates low.[98] In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March.[99]\n\nAfter a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020,[100] Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July.[101] Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections.[101] Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December;[102] a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6:00 p.m. closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested.[103] From late January 2021, the government repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testings. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.[104] From early 2022, to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong had been placed under tightened alert until the day it became 70% fully inoculated.[105] Nonetheless, earlier focus and messaging about eliminating all cases had weakened the case for getting vaccinated in the first place, with less than one-quarter of people aged 80 or older having received two doses of a vaccine before Omicron surged.[106]\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the Omicron variant had caused the largest outbreak to date in the territory; authorities modified their eradication protocols, but continued to pursue containment.[107] By mid-March, the virus spread rapidly in the densely populated city, and researchers at University of Hong Kong estimated that almost half the population was infected at one point since the start of the outbreak, compared to only 1 percent of the population before the surge.[106][108] Daily new cases peaked to over 70,000 by March, a far cry from the single-digit daily case loads from Hong Kong\'s successful implementation of Zero-COVID. Total deaths increased from around 200 over the two years of the pandemic[109] to exceeding 7,000 in a span of a few weeks, leading Hong Kong\'s COVID-19 deaths per capita, once far lower than those of Western nations, to become the highest in the world during March.[108] The massive death toll and high infection rates while maintaining strict eradication protocols led to the calls for authorities to review Hong Kong\'s Zero-COVID strategy, as well as questioning the sustainability of such an approach with the Omicron variant.[110][111]\n\nMacau\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Macau\n\nMacau, like mainland China and Hong Kong, has followed a zero-COVID strategy (Portuguese: Meta Dinâmica de Infecção Zero). The city, whose economy is heavily dependent on revenues from its casinos, has closed its borders to all travelers who are not residents of Greater China. Despite its proximity to mainland China, from the beginning of the pandemic through 11 March 2022, Macau confirmed only 82 total infections and not a single death.[112]\n\nFrom mid-June to mid-July 2022, Macau saw an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Health authorities imposed restrictions on activities, including ordering residents to stay at home and the closure of non-essential businesses, including for the first time since February 2020, all its casinos.[113] After nine consecutive days of no local cases and over 14 rounds of mandatory mass testing, Macau reopened in what the city\'s government called a ""consolidation period"".[114]\n\nIn December 2022, in line with mainland China\'s easing of its zero-COVID policy, Macau eased its testing and quarantine policies.[115]\n\nMontserrat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British territory and Caribbean island of Montserrat used a Zero-COVID strategy, using testing and quarantine on inbound travelers to prevent localized outbreaks. It had suffered just 175 cases and two deaths as of April 2022.[116] From 31 December 2021, Montserrat suffered its first major outbreak, with 67 locally transmitted infections and one death.[117] On 1 March 2022, the ministry of health declared the outbreak to be over, having gone 31 days without a locally transmitted case.[118] In October 2022, Montserrat ended measures.[119]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand reported its first case of COVID-19 on 28 February 2020.[120] From 19 March, entry into New Zealand was limited to citizens and residents,[121] and the country began quarantining new arrivals in converted hotels on 10 April.[122]\n\nOn 21 March, a four-tier alert level system was introduced, and most of the country was placed under lockdown from 25 March.[123] Due to the success of the elimination strategy, restrictions were progressively lifted between 28 April and 8 June, when the country moved to the lowest alert level, and the last restrictions (other than quarantine for travelers) were removed.[124][125][126][127][128]\n\nAfter the lifting of restrictions, New Zealand went for 102 days without any community transmission.[129] On 11 August 2020, four members of a single family in Auckland tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, prompting a city-wide lockdown, and lesser restrictions throughout New Zealand.[129] Additional cases related to this cluster of infections were identified over the following weeks. On 21 September, after a week without any new cases of community transmission, restrictions were dropped to the lowest level outside of Auckland. Restrictions in Auckland were eased somewhat two days later,[130] and moved to the lowest level on 7 October.[131]\n\nAdditional small outbreaks led to temporary restrictions in parts of New Zealand in February, March, and June 2021.[132]\n\nThe country moved to a nationwide lockdown on 17 August 2021, after the detection of one new local case outside of quarantine in Auckland.[133] Over the following weeks, Auckland remained under lockdown as cases rose, while most of the rest of the country progressively eased restrictions.[132] On 4 October 2021, the government of New Zealand announced that it was transitioning away from its zero-COVID strategy, arguing that the Delta variant made elimination infeasible.[134]\n\nNorth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Korea also reportedly follows an ""elimination strategy"".[135]\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland, led by its devolved government, pursued an ""elimination"" COVID-19 strategy starting from April 2020.[167] The Scottish government\'s approach diverged with that of the central British government in April 2020, after a UK-wide lockdown began being lifted. Scotland pursued a slower approach to lifting the lockdown than other nations of the UK, and expanded a ""test and trace"" system.[167] Although Northern Ireland also pursued the strategy[11][168] and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advocated for the approach to be adopted by the whole of the UK,[168] the central British government pursued a different mitigation strategy that applied to England, with commentators noting that this combined with an open Anglo-Scottish border could undermine Scotland\'s attempts at elimination.[169][11][170]\n\nSingapore\n\n[edit]\n\nSingapore recorded its first COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020.[171] With that, many Singaporeans had purchased and worn masks when not at home; practiced social distancing and on 7 February 2020, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin.[172] On 3 April 2020, a stringent set of preventive measures collectively called the ""circuit breaker lockdown"" was announced.[173] Stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire were implemented as a preventive measure by the Government of Singapore in response on 7 April 2020. The measures were brought into legal effect by the Minister for Health with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.[174]\n\nThe country introduced what was considered one of the world\'s largest and best-organised epidemic control programmes.[175][176] The ""Control Order"" implemented various measures such as; mass testing the population for the virus, isolating any infected people as well as introducing contact tracing apps and strictly quarantining those they had close contact with those infected. All non-essential workplaces closed, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. Non-essential advertising at shopping centres are not allowed to be shown or advertised and only advertising from essential service offers and safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are allowed.[177]\n\nThese measures helped to prevent these lockdowns after the end of the circuit breaker lockdown measures in June 2020 with reopening being staggered in different steps all the way until April 2021.[178][179] The high transmissibility of the Delta and Omicron variants challenged Singapore\'s Zero-COVID approach, and the country phased it out after vaccinating the majority of its population in October 2021.[180]\n\nSouth Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: K-Quarantine\n\nThe first case in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[181] On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent spread of the disease, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from China.[182][183] Various other measures have been taken: mass testing the population, isolating infected people, and trace and quarantine of those they had contact with.[184][185] The rapid and extensive testing undertaken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without using drastic measures.[184][186][187] There was no general lockdown of businesses in South Korea, with supermarkets and other retailers remaining open. However, schools, universities, cinemas, and gyms were closed soon after the outbreaks, with schools and universities having online classes.[188]\n\nThe government is providing citizens with information in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese on how to not become infected and how to prevent spreading the disease as part of its ""K-Quarantine"" measures. This includes information on cough etiquette, when and how to wear a face mask, and the importance of physical distancing and staying at home.[188] The South Korean government has also been sending daily emergency notifications, detailing information on locations with reported infections and other status updates related to the pandemic.[189] Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. People who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[190]\n\nTaiwan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\n\nDue to its extensive cultural and economic exchanges with mainland China, Taiwan was initially expected to be at high risk of developing a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19.[191][192]\n\nImmediately after mainland China notified the WHO of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan on 31 December 2019, Taiwanese officials began screening passengers arriving from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia.[192] This screening was subsequently broadened to all passengers with respiratory symptoms who had recently visited Wuhan.[192] Beginning in early February 2020, all passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau were required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arrival in Taiwan.[30] Mobile phone data was used to monitor compliance with quarantine requirements.[192]\n\nPublic places such as schools, restaurants and offices in Taiwan were required to monitor body temperature of visitors and provide hand sanitizer.[193] Mask-wearing was encouraged, and on 24 January, an export ban and price controls were placed on surgical masks and other types of personal protective equipment.[193]\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Taiwan initiated 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals, and began converting commercial hotels into quarantine facilities.[194] In early April, Taiwanese public health officials announced social distancing measures, and mandated mask use in public transport.[30]\n\nThe first known case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was identified on 21 January 2020.[193] On 31 January, approximately 3,000 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship went ashore in Taiwan. Five days later, it was recognized that there was an outbreak on the ship.[195] Taiwanese public health authorities used mobile phone data and other contact tracing measures to identify these passengers and their close contacts for testing and quarantine.[195] No cases related to these passengers were identified in Taiwan.[195]\n\nTaiwan maintained near-zero viral prevalence throughout 2020, totaling just 56 known locally transmitted cases (out of a population of 23.6 million) through 31 December 2020.[191]\n\nTaiwan experienced its largest outbreak from April to August 2021, initially caused by violations of COVID-19 quarantine rules by international flight crews.[196][197] On 15 May 2021, Taiwan identified more than 100 daily cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic.[198] The outbreak was brought to an end on 25 August 2021, when Taiwan recorded no new locally transmitted cases for the first time since May 2021.[199]\n\nIn April 2022, the government departed from Zero-COVID, launching a revised strategy—billed as the ""new Taiwanese model""—that no longer focuses on total suppression, but rather shifts to mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Premier Su Tseng-chang was cited as saying the new model is not the same as ""living with COVID-19"", as the virus would not be allowed to spread unchecked, but active prevention of the virus\'s spread would be balanced with allowing people to live normal lives and a stable reopening of the economy.[200] As of early May 2022, the government has maintained the policy amidst a wave of infections that crossed 30,000 new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the pandemic began, and that Health minister Chen Shih-chung said was on track to reach up to 100,000 new infections daily.[201] On 7 May 2022, Taiwan reported 46,377 new cases, overtaking the United States as the highest daily new case region.[202]\n\nEast Timor\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fragile healthcare system, East Timor would have been deeply affected by a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The East Timor government implemented a strategy to keep the virus out by closing the border with Indonesia, and only allowing entry of citizens by repatriation flights.[203] This strategy was effective initially. During 2020, the country reported 44 infections and zero fatalities, and the country was able to function normally, with no lockdowns and largely maskless crowds celebrating Christmas in 2020.[203] However, new variants caused a spike beginning in March 2021, prompting mask mandates and some restrictions on business operations.[204] Timorese authorities were able to contain this outbreak by November 2021, and on 30 November, the state of emergency ended. Business restrictions, as well as the outdoor mask mandate, were lifted.[205] The indoor mask mandate was lifted on 7 January 2022, and as of March 2022, the country maintained an elimination strategy to keep out all infections.[citation needed]\n\nTonga\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Tonga\n\nTonga has followed a Zero-COVID policy, but more than a year and a half into the pandemic, on 29 October 2021, the first COVID-19 case—a seasonal worker who returned from New Zealand and entered quarantine—was confirmed. The country\'s COVID-19 policy caused complications with international aid following the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in 2022.[206] To keep the country virus-free, an Australian aid flight had to return to base after detecting a case midflight, while HMAS Adelaide (L01) made plans to stay at sea after 23 members of her crew tested positive for COVID-19.[207]\n\nVietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nThe virus was first confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020, when two Chinese people in Ho Chi Minh City tested positive for the virus.[208][209] In response the government issued a diagnostic and management guidelines for COVID-19, providing instructions on contact tracing and 14-day isolation.[16] Health authorities began monitoring body temperatures at border gates and started detection and contact tracing, with orders for the mandatory isolation of infected people and anyone they had come into contact with.[210]\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam was cited by global media as having one of the best-organized epidemic control programs in the world,[211][212][213] along the lines of other highlights such as Taiwan and South Korea.[214] This success has been attributed to several factors, including a well-developed public health system, a decisive central government, and a proactive containment strategy based on comprehensive testing, tracing, and quarantining.[15] However, instead of relying on medicine and technology, the Vietnamese state security apparatus has adopted a widespread public surveillance system along with a public well-respected military force.[215][216]\n\nStarting in April 2021, Vietnam experienced its largest outbreak to date, with over 1.2 million infections recorded by November.[217] This led to two of its largest cities (Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi) and around a third of the country\'s population coming under some form of lockdown by late July.[218] A degree of complacency after successes in previous outbreaks, and infections originating from foreign workers were all considered to have contributed to the outbreak. In response, government-mandated quarantine for foreign arrivals and close contacts to confirmed cases was extended to 21 days, and accompanying safety measures also tightened up.[219]\n\nIn September 2021, Vietnam abandoned its zero-COVID strategy, after a three-month lockdown of Ho Chi Minh City caused major economic disruption in the city and failed to contain the outbreak. The country shifted to a phased reopening and more flexible approach while expanding its vaccination programme.[220][221]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport\n\n[edit]\n\nProponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that successful execution reduced the number of nationwide lockdowns needed,[222] since the main goal was focused on the elimination of the virus. When the virus was eliminated, people would be at ease given that COVID-19 caused a lot of health impacts. As such, healthcare and economic costs were lower under a zero-COVID strategy because the elimination of the virus allowed new outbreaks to be easily monitored and curtailed, and that there was less economic disruption since only certain areas were affected, which could be easily monitored.[223][224] This resulted in a situation that was less costly to society,[225] that it reduced dependence on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines,[226] and that it increased quality of life and life expectancy as there would have been fewer citizens contracting COVID-19.[227]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe zero-COVID strategy, unlike other strategies such as mitigation or living with COVID-19, aimed to eliminate the virus altogether. While mitigation and living with COVID-19 aimed to tolerate outbreaks of COVID-19, to the extent of ignoring outbreaks altogether, the zero-COVID strategy required quick, efficient, and immediate containment of the virus in order for the policy to work. This meant that governments that decided to use this strategy would need to utilize all means possible, from closing schools and shops, to implementing strict lockdowns or even culling animals deemed to carry the virus, in order to get the cases down to zero. Such measures had resulted in negative connotations which can affect lives, livelihoods, and mental health as seen in the following examples.\n\nChinese virologist Guan Yi had criticized the Chinese government\'s zero-COVID measures, telling Phoenix Hong Kong Channel that, if the government persisted with the policy for a handful of cases, the economy would have suffered. The implementation of the zero-COVID policy in China resulted in multiple business closures, citywide lockdowns, and stay-at-home notices in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This resulted in loss of revenue and production, leading to an economic contraction in the country. Guan had advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which could enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.[228]\n\nOther opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argued that the strategy caused the economy to suffer,[229] that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,[230] that zero-COVID is not sustainable,[231] and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant were so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer feasible.[232]\n\nIn May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy was no longer considered sustainable based on ""the behavior of the virus now"" and future trends. The comment was suppressed on the Chinese Internet.[233] The Lancet, mostly supportive of a zero-COVID strategy before the appearance of less severe but more transmissible variants, also published a news article detailing the problems in China\'s implementation.[234]\n\nAll countries which pursued zero-COVID, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, later decided to discontinue it, citing increased vaccination rates and more transmissible variants.[230] Singapore abandoned zero-COVID in August 2021 after the Delta variant started spreading there, Australia and Vietnam reopened their borders in early 2022, and China—the last major country to hold out on zero-COVID—abandoned its policy on December 7, 2022.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 portal\n\nBaltic Bubble\n\nEndemic COVID-19\n\nEradication of infectious diseases\n\nList of COVID-19 pandemic legislation\n\nProtective sequestration\n\nUse and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23573171/zero-covid-china-lockdowns-future-pandemics-public-health', 'Headline': 'What can the world learn from China’s “zero-Covid” lockdown?', 'Snippet': 'Meanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/news-release/2022/areaemployment_chicago_20220930.htm', 'Headline': 'Chicago Area Employment - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Snippet': 'Total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI, metropolitan area increased by 201,200 over the year in August. ...

The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to decrease volatility in estimation.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available online at https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/benchmark.htm.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Measures of sampling error for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions at www.bls.gov/web/laus/790stderr.htm.\n\nArea definitions.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/05/us/jan-6-fact-check', 'Headline': 'A Year After the Breach, Falsehoods About Jan. 6 Persist - The New York ...', 'Snippet': 'There is no evidence that Ms. Pelosi’s office rejected a request to deploy the National Guard, or even played a role in delays over approval. ... and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while ...', 'Full_text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that the rioters were supporters of Mr. Trump, but that has not stopped the cascade of specious claims seeking to pin responsibility on others.\n\nA false theory blaming agitators affiliated with antifa, a loose collection of antifascist activists, began to spread on social media before the riot had even ended. Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence. In other words, 1 in about 4,400 committed a violent crime, assuming the same crime rate across the entire arrestee population.\n\nIn comparison, crowd experts and officials have estimated that up to 10,000 people entered the Capitol grounds. Out of the more than 729 arrested so far, 176, or about a quarter, have been charged with crimes related to violence. In other words, at least 1 in 56 committed a violent crime.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/16/john-sullivan-convicted-jan-6-film/', 'Headline': 'Activist who filmed Ashli Babbitt’s shooting on Jan. 6 convicted - The ...', 'Snippet': 'By Tom Jackman.

The fake electors plot was a core component of the then-president and his aligned lawyers’ plans to overturn his 2020 election defeat and stop the legitimate transfer of power to his Democratic successor Joe Biden.\n\nThe sources add that Ward — once one of the state’s most prominent Republicans — and her potential contacts and private activities following Election Day 2020 have been of particular interest to investigators as of late. One of these sources describes Arizona investigators as “moving aggressively” on this stage of the inquiry into the state’s pro-Trump fake electors, which included Ward, a Trump hardliner and then-chair of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nWard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWard, her husband, Michael, and nine other Arizona Republicans signed a document falsely attesting that they were the state’s legitimate electors casting Arizona’s Electoral College votes for Trump.\n\nAccording to the January 6 Committee report, Ward was “unusually active” in her advocacy for President Trump after the election. She spoke with the former president and participated in a Trump-backed pressure campaign to get the state to stop counting votes and delay certification of the tally showing Biden’s victory.\n\nAfter Arizona certified its vote tally, Ward, her husband Michael, and 9 other Republicans in the state convened to falsely represent themselves as Arizona’s legitimate slate of electors during a signing ceremony recorded and shared on social media.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nIn an email from Trump–aligned attorney Kenneth Chesebro to colleagues on the Trump team, the attorney relayed concerns from Ward and Republican state senator Kelly Townsend about the legality of the ploy.\n\n“Ward and Townsend are concerned it could appear treasonous for the AZ electors to vote on Monday if there is no pending court proceeding that might, eventually, lead to the electors being ratified as the legitimate ones,” Chesebro wrote in an email obtained by The New York Times.\n\nInvestigators have started asking questions about any potential contacts between false electors such as Ward, then-President Trump, and other out-of-state officials and lawyers working on his behalf to steal the election, one of the sources tells Rolling Stone. In recent discussions with possible witnesses and others, some investigators have asked or requested information related to a video — tweeted by the Arizona GOP in December 2020 — where Ward and other Trump allies sign documents falsely claiming to be the state’s legitimate electors.\n\n“They actually have themselves on video doing it,” says one of the people familiar with the stage of the investigation. “It is as if Ward and everyone else were thinking: How do we make this a walk in the park for [the prosecutors]?”\n\nA spokesperson for the Arizona attorney general’s office declined to comment and referred Rolling Stone to public comments made by Attorney General Kris Mayes on Wednesday following the Trump indictment in Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nRelated Content\n\n“We are investigating the fake electors situation. I understand why folks want to know what is happening in our investigation. That is a natural desire given what just happened in Georgia and in Michigan,” Mayes said. “But we are doing a thorough and professional investigation and we’re going to do it on our timetable as justice demands.”\n\nWard has already drawn the attention of the federal special counsel’s office related to a 2020 lawsuit alleging “misconduct” by election officials and a mass of “illegal votes.” In May, prosecutors from the special counsel subpoenaed the Arizona secretary of state’s office asking for records related to both Ward’s suit and a suit from the Trump campaign alleging that election machines in the state had erroneously rejected ballots from voters. Arizona courts ultimately tossed both suits.\n\nIn July, former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers also told CNN that he was interviewed by FBI agents as part of the special counsel’s investigation into the 2020 election. Trump and senior advisers pressured Bowers to decertify the state electors for Biden, a move Bowers refused.\n\nReached on Friday, Bowers declined to answer questions. “I am under counsel to not discuss anything at this time, so I must … [decline to comment],” he tells Rolling Stone.\n\nBefore Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the attempt to overturn the election, both Ward and her husband received subpoenas to testify before a federal grand jury investigating the fake electors scheme in the state.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nWard also fought an unsuccessful legal battle to shield her phone records from the January 6 Committee. The committee questioned Ward under subpoena but she invoked the Fifth Amendment and declined to answer.\n\nCorrection: This post has been corrected to fix the name of Kelly Townsend.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-senate-president-karen-fann-subpoenaed-by-fbi-in-connection-with-jan-6-probe-gop-officials-confirm', 'Headline': 'Arizona State Sens.

Karen Fann, Kelly Townsend subpoenaed by FBI in connection with Jan. 6 probe By Kenneth Wong Updated June 30, 2022 9:55pm MST', 'Full_text': 'Officials with the FBI have subpoenaed two Arizona Senate Republicans in connection with an investigation into former President Donald Trump\'s alleged pressure campaign on state-level officials following the 2020 election.\n\nAccording to Kim Quintero with the Arizona Senate Republicans, State Senate President Karen Fan, as well as State Senator Kelly Townsend, were targeted by the subpoenas.\n\nQuintero wrote that she cannot comment further on this matter, since the documents expressly state that Fann is not to comment on the matter.\n\nElsewhere in her statement, Quintero lambasted the subpoena as ""political theatrics"" by President Joe Biden\'s administration.\n\n""We only wish they’d put as much effort into inflation, gas prices and border security,"" the statement read, in part.\n\nHowever, Quintero did state that Fann is fully cooperating in ""releasing whatever emails and text messages they are requesting.""\n\n""We have no reason to believe she will be called to testify in Washington D.C.,"" Quintero wrote.\n\nInvestigators reportedly wanted to look at records from Fann and Townsend. Fann led a charge to conduct a controversial audit of Arizona\'s election results, while Townsend was a vocal supporter of the audit.\n\nResults of the audit, released in September 2021, found no proof to support former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. The firm hired by Republican lawmakers issued a report that experts described as riddled with errors, bias and flawed methodology. Still, the review came up with a vote tally that would not have altered the outcome, finding that Biden won by 360 more votes than the official results certified last year.\n\nOther Arizonans have also been subpoenaed\n\nFann is not the first Arizonan to have been subpoenaed in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nIn February, it was reported that Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, along with her husband, have filed a lawsuit that seeks to block a subpoena of their phone records by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nBoth Ward and her husband were presidential electors who would have voted for Donald Trump had he won Arizona\'s electoral votes. Both signed a document falsely claiming they were Arizona’s true electors, despite Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the state. Lawyers for the Wards, who are both physicians, argue that turning over their phone records would compromise the private health information of their patients. They also say it would violate their 1st Amendment rights.\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem was also subpoenaed alongside Ward. Their subpoenas came weeks after Nancy Cottle and Loraine B. Pellegrino were subpoenaed by the same committee.\n\nLike Ward, Cottle and Pellegrino were presidential electors.

Viral online posts distorted his comments to misleadingly claim that half of employees at federal health agencies “are refusing” the vaccines, which Fauci never said.\n\nAt the time, NIAID told us that 67% of the NIH staff were vaccinated, but the “actual number may be higher” because reporting was voluntary.\n\nSee, “Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,” May 21, 2021\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. But a Gateway Pundit story shared on Facebook in June 2021 declared, “SMOKING GUN: FAUCI LIED, MILLIONS DIED — Fauci Was Informed of Hydroxychloroquine Success in Early 2020 But Lied to Public Instead Despite the Science.”\n\nThe story was based on two emails that were sent to Fauci in February 2020. In one email, two doctors expressed the possibility that the drug could be effective against COVID-19. Fauci forwarded the email to an NIH deputy director who works in microbiology and infectious diseases and wrote: “Please take a look and respond to them. Thanks.”\n\nIn the other email, a pharmacologist made reference to “data from 2005 showing inhibition of SARS infection,” which is a different disease caused by a different coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) from the one that leads to COVID-19. We previously wrote about a 2005 study that found the drug prevented the spread of that SARS virus in cell culture — which is not the same as working in humans.\n\nThose emails are not evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, or that Fauci kept this from the public. In fact, randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. The drug was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nA viral social media post falsely claimed that Fauci was “pushing” remdesivir because he “invented” it with Bill Gates and they would profit from its use.\n\nFauci does not hold a patent for remdesivir, and a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told USA Today that the foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of the drug.\n\nSee, “Fauci Didn’t Invent, Won’t Profit from Remdesivir,” May 21, 2020\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nIt is still uncertain how SARS-CoV-2 originated, but many scientists suspect the virus “spilled over” into humans from an animal. There is no evidence the virus was created in a lab, let alone as part of any U.S.-funded research.\n\nA June 2021 Facebook post claimed that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” because of an email he received from Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. In that Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” He mentioned others, too, found “the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\n\nBut Andersen said in his email that more analysis was necessary and “opinions could still change,” which is what later happened.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists that said they determined that the coronavirus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The authors added that they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.”\n\nSee, “Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails,” June 4, 2021\n\nFormer White House trade adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that Fauci “killed a lot of people” by funding some bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is in Wuhan, China, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified.\n\nNIAID did provide a multimillion-dollar grant to fund some of the lab’s research, but the NIH has explained that those experiments could not have led to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because the viruses that were being studied were very different.\n\n“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” then-NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20, 2021, statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”\n\nSee, “Navarro Falsely Links Fauci to Pandemic Origin,” May 19, 2022\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul accused Fauci of lying when Fauci said in a May 2021 Senate hearing that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” But there’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in a July 20, 2021, hearing, about funding gain-of-function research — which the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to “increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.”\n\nFauci has said that the research that was funded “was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,” and the NIH has said the same. The issue is that scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul has posited that Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” if the SARS-CoV-2 virus leaked from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research. But there is no proof of a lab leak, and there is evidence that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant could not have caused the pandemic.\n\nSee, “The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,” May 21, 2021, and “Fauci and Paul, Round 2,” July 22, 2021\n\nIn December 2014, the NIH posted a photo of Fauci and former President Barack Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The photo showed Obama speaking about Ebola research with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, and Fauci was shown standing next to Sylvia Burwell, who was the health and human services secretary at the time.\n\nBut the years-old photo was circulated in 2020 along with the false claim that the image showed “Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015,” suggesting a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee, “Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab,'”July 17, 2020\n\nOther Claims\n\nA series of reports in 2021 from a group that opposes federal funding for research relying on animal testing prompted dozens of readers to ask us if Fauci had a history of cruelty to animals, specifically beagles.\n\nThe NIAID admitted to FactCheck.org in a statement that Fauci was involved in the process of awarding funding for a number of research projects that used beagles as test subjects. But the agency denied that it funded one particular project in Tunisia that went viral on social media because of images from a published study that showed sedated beagles with their heads stuck in mesh cages filled with diseased sand flies.\n\nSee, “Answering Questions About #BeagleGate,” Nov. 2, 2021\n\nFauci is among the many federal employees who are required to submit an annual public financial disclosure report to their employing agency or department. His reports — which list his assets, income, employment agreements and other financial information — are available upon request from the NIH’s FOIA office.\n\nBut in a January congressional hearing, Republican Sen. Roger Marshall asked Fauci if he would be willing to publicly release “a financial disclosure form,” suggesting that Fauci’s reports are not available to the public and are being hidden by “the big tech giants.”""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/01/11/dr-anthony-fauci-rand-paul-coronavirus-hearing-vpx.cnn', 'Headline': '‘You personally attack me:’ Fauci fires back at Sen.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.\n\nSeparate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.\n\nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs.\n\nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data, external - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\n\nAccording to that data, external, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.\n\nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.\n\nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people.\n\nDaily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.\n\nNorth Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic ""fever cases"" according to the state news agency.\n\nChina appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai.

Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country.\n\nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.\n\nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\n\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.\n\nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources.

The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe numbers paint a grim picture:\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8% of the world population. This compares with 8% in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 - 31.9% of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6% of men – a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44% of infants under 6 months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50% target by 2030. Of great concern, 2 in 3 children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8% of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 – even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\n“This report repeatedly highlights the intensification of these major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks, combined with growing inequalities,” the heads of the five UN agencies (2) wrote in this year's Foreword. “The issue at stake is not whether adversities will continue to occur or not, but how we must take bolder action to build resilience against future shocks.”\n\nRepurposing agricultural policies\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost US$ 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion's share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That's in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivized food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nFinally, the report also points out that governments could do more to reduce trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.\n\n(1) It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021. The estimate is presented as a range to reflect the added uncertainty in data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. The increases are measured with reference to the middle of the projected range (768 million).\n\n(2) For FAO - QU Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD - Gilbert F. Houngbo, President; for UNICEF - Catherine Russell, Executive Director; for WFP - David Beasley, Executive Director; for WHO - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General.\n\nWhat they said\n\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu: “Low-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.”\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo: “These are depressing figures for humanity. We continue to move away from our goal of ending hunger by 2030. The ripple effects of the global food crisis will most likely worsen the outcome again next year. We need a more intense approach to end hunger and IFAD stands ready to do its part by scaling up its operations and impact. We look forward to having everyone's support.”\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell: “The unprecedented scale of the malnutrition crisis demands an unprecedented response. We must double our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable children have access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets -- and services for the early prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition. With so many children’s lives and futures at stake, this is the time to step up our ambition for child nutrition – and we have no time to waste.”\n\nWFP Executive Director David Beasley: “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead. The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilizers that we are seeing as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. The result will be global destabilization, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale. We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “Every year, 11 million people die due to unhealthy diets. Rising food prices mean this will only get worse. WHO supports countries’ efforts to improve food systems through taxing unhealthy foods and subsidising healthy options, protecting children from harmful marketing, and ensuring clear nutrition labels. We must work together to achieve the 2030 global nutrition targets, to fight hunger and malnutrition, and to ensure that food is a source of health for all.”\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAcute food insecurity: food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time and of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance in providing strategic guidance to actions that focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity.\n\nHunger: an uncomfortable or painful sensation caused by insufficient energy from diet. Food deprivation. In this report, the term hunger is synonymous with chronic undernourishment and is measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).\n\nMalnutrition: an abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\n\nModerate food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which people face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality and disrupts normal eating patterns. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.\n\nSevere food insecurity: a level of severity of food insecurity at which, at some time during the year, people have run out of food, experienced hunger and at the most extreme, gone without food for a day or more. Measured based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale.""}, 2: {'URL': 'https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/food-insecurity-in-the-time-of-covid', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity in the Time of COVID - Johns Hopkins', 'Snippet': 'Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted food supplies, health systems, and global nutrition programs, 800 million around the world were undernourished (supplied with less than the minimum amount of the nutrients or foods essential for sound health and growth).

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2023/22_0212.htm', 'Headline': 'Food Insecurity Trajectories in the US During the First Year of the ...', 'Snippet': 'Food insecurity trajectories.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/hillary-clinton-robby-mook-fbi/index.html', 'Headline': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved plan to share Trump-Russia ...', 'Snippet': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top ...', 'Full_text': 'Hillary Clinton personally approved her campaign’s plans in fall 2016 to share information with a reporter about an uncorroborated alleged server backchannel between Donald Trump and a top Russian bank, her former campaign manager testified Friday in federal court.\n\nRobby Mook said he attended a meeting with other senior campaign officials where they learned about strange cyberactivity that suggested a relationship between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Moscow. The group decided to share the information with a reporter, and Mook subsequently ran that decision by Clinton herself.\n\n“We discussed it with Hillary,” Mook said, later adding that “she agreed with the decision.”\n\nA campaign staffer later passed the information to a reporter from Slate magazine, which the campaign hoped the reporter would “vet it out, and write what they believe is true,” Mook said.\n\nSlate published a story on October 31, 2016, raising questions about the odd Trump-Alfa cyber links. After that story came out, Clinton tweeted about it, and posted a news release that said, “This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.”\n\nThe testimony came in the criminal trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is being prosecuted by the Trump-era special counsel John Durham. Durham is investigating potential misconduct tied to the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe. The trial has shed light on the dark arts of political opposition research – and how campaigns dig up dirt and plant stories in the press.\n\nFederal investigators ultimately concluded there weren’t any improper Trump-Alfa cyber links.\n\nClinton officials say they didn’t authorize FBI meeting\n\nSussmann passed along the same information about Trump and Alfa Bank to an FBI official in September 2016. Prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI and allege that he falsely told the FBI official that he wasn’t there for a client, even though he was there on Clinton’s behalf.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and maintains that he went “to help the FBI” as a concerned citizen, and that the Clinton campaign wouldn’t have wanted him to meet with the FBI in the first place.\n\nMook and another top Clinton campaign official, general counsel Marc Elias, reinforced that assertion this week on the witness stand. They both testified they didn’t authorize or direct Sussmann to go to the FBI with the explosive Trump tip. Mook said Friday that he didn’t even know who Sussmann was during the 2016 campaign, and would’ve opposed an FBI meeting.\n\n“Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,” Mook said. “You do that through the media, which is why the information was shared with the media.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Elias told the jury that he didn’t authorize Sussmann’s meeting with the FBI, which occurred on September 19, 2016. Elias said he hadn’t learned about the fateful meeting between Sussmann and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker until Sussmann was indicted.\n\nIn addition to going to the FBI, Sussmann provided the technical internet data to a reporter from The New York Times, who was working on a story that the FBI spiked after learning about it from Sussmann. A staffer from Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm hired by the Clinton campaign, testified that she met with a Slate reporter to discuss the Trump-Alfa allegations.\n\nTestimony from witnesses suggested the media outreach wasn’t closely coordinated, though the situation isn’t fully clear. Mook said he didn’t know about Perkins Coie, the law firm where Sussmann and Elias worked, “playing a role with us sharing the information with the media.”\n\nOld Clinton tweet spurs online reaction\n\nInside the courtroom, prosecutors showed the jury Clinton’s tweet about the Trump-Alfa article from Slate, and Mook read aloud portions of the campaign’s news release about the story. The release was from Jake Sullivan, who is currently President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.\n\n“We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections,” Sullivan said in the release on October 31, 2016, one week before Election Day.\n\nThe special counsel team has previously said that the Clinton campaign’s media blitz around the Slate story “is the very culmination of Mr. Sussmann’s work and strategy,” to allegedly gin up news coverage about the Trump-Alfa allegations and then get the FBI to start an investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Twitter users recirculated Clinton’s old post. It caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who has become increasingly vocal about political matters while he tries to buy Twitter, and recently announced his support for the Republican Party. He called the Trump-Alfa allegation “a Clinton campaign hoax” and claimed that Sussmann “created an elaborate hoax.”\n\nSussmann’s lawyers declined to comment to CNN about Musk’s tweets.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Musk’s claim that Sussmann or the Clinton campaign peddled information they knew was untrue. Multiple witnesses testified that respected cyber experts harbored genuine national security concerns about the data. Sussmann’s lawyers repeatedly said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the material when he provided it to the FBI.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-russian-collusion-hoax-good-080201121.html', 'Headline': ""Trump was right: 'Russian collusion' was a hoax.

Eventually, the judge stropped trying to control Trump – he and the attorney general’s lawyer questioning Trump let him rant, and then mostly disregarded the missives.\n\nThe high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. Engoron has already ruled Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. The New York attorney general’s office said they will rest their case after Ivanka Trump’s testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump’s day on the stand:\n\nTrump’s campaign comes to the courtroom: The former president’s rhetoric at times during his testimony might as well have been at one of his rallies in front of supporters. He went after the attorney general. The judge. And the “political witch hunt” that he’s been railing against for years now. On the witness stand, the charged rhetoric was even more remarkable, as he attacked the judge sitting right next to him, with James in the courtroom watching his testimony just feet away. “The fraud is on the court, not on me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump gets an angry response from the judge: Judge Engoron tried at the outset of Trump’s testimony to stop the former president from making speeches and instead answer the questions, but it did little to change Trump’s approach. The judge responded by threatening to remove Trump from the witness stand, though that didn’t deter the former president either. “This is not a political rally,” Engoron said to Trump, telling Trump’s attorney Christopher Kise to “control your client.”\n\nTrump acknowledges changing valuation of Trump Tower triplex: The attorney general’s office pressed Trump on the properties central to his identity and brand: Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and other key parts of his real estate empire. The AG’s office attorney Kevin Wallace also pressed Trump on why valuations of properties were changed, such as his Trump Tower triplex, which was devalued on his financial statement in 2017 after a Forbes article found he had dramatically exaggerated the size of the apartment. Trump acknowledged there had on occasion been mistakes, such as the Trump Tower apartment valuation.\n\nTrump’s descriptions of his properties: The former president’s rhetorical flourishes went beyond attacking those who are investigating him. He also took the opportunity to play salesman and play up his properties. One of his chief complaints about the judge is a citation in his decision that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18 million, a number based on Florida tax appraisal records “It’s much more valuable,” Trump said of Mar-a-Lago, “and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes, that it’s biggest value is using it as a club.” Wallace took the answer to pin him down on that valuation. “You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” Wallace asked. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nKeep reading takeaways here.\n\nTrump finishes testimony in fraud trial; Ivanka Trump to testify Wednesday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stepped down from the stand after nearly four hours of testimony in the civil fraud trial against him and his company.\n\nThe next witness will be his daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday, after which the attorney general’s office plans to rest its case.\n\nTrump’s attorney Chris Kise said he believes the trial should end in mid-December.\n\nTrump on whether he maintained accurate records from August 2014 onward: ""I hope so""\n\nWhen asked by the Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office whether he “maintained accurate books and records” from August 2014 going forward, Donald Trump said “I hope so.”\n\n“I hope so, I didn’t keep them myself. I hope so,” Trump testified during his civil fraud trial Monday.\n\n“You don’t know one way or the other?” Wallace asked.\n\nTrump\'s civil fraud trial breaks for lunch\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial has broken for lunch, and will resume at 2:15 p.m. ET with Trump back on the stand.\n\nTrump exited the courtroom during the lunch break. He did not speak, only giving a double thumbs up.\n\nTrump leans on the disclaimers in his financial statements as defense in fraud trial\n\nDonald Trump said his financial statements would always hold up in court — “except maybe in this court” — because of the disclaimers that are added to the statements.\n\nKevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office asked Trump if he was aware of any other properties on the financial statements from 2011-2017 that were overstated.\n\nTrump replied: “I don’t know of any, but not that would have a material effect. Anything that would be a little bit off would be nonmaterial.”\n\nThe former president then pointed to the disclaimers on the financial documents saying that “They always hold up in court, expect maybe in this court, they always hold up in court, always. It’s a disclaimer.”\n\n“One of the reasons I never got too involved in these statements is that clause is on page one, as you know better than anybody,” Trump says. “And that’s why we shouldn’t be having a case here.”\n\nTrump was animated during this reply, saying any court but this judge would hold up the disclaimers in court.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron was observed puffing his cheeks during this interaction.\n\n“People don’t know how good a company I’ve built,” Trump said as he attacked Attorney General Letitia James for prosecuting him. “Because people like you go around trying to demean me and hurt me,” Trump said, adding he was being prosecuted “probably for political reasons — in her case definitely,” referring to James seated in the front row.\n\nThe complaint filed by James addressed disclaimers, stating while they may relieve accountants of certain obligations that would otherwise adhere to their work on a more rigorous audit engagement, they do not give license to Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization to submit to their accountants fraudulent and misleading asset valuations for inclusion in the statements.\n\nTrump goes after New York attorney general and judge in rant\n\nThe past 45 minutes or so of testimony went along mostly without a hitch, but the past few minutes has seen former President Donald Trump ramp up the political rhetoric.\n\n“What’s going on here, how can a thing like this be going on? It’s disgraceful,” Trump said after being asked about the Mar-a-Lago property evaluation, turning his attention to New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump also criticized Judge Arthur Engoron again for the ruling that Trump committed fraud issued before the trial.\n\n“He called me a fraud and he didn’t know anything about me,” Trump said, referencing the judge.\n\n“Read my opinion perhaps or for the first time,” the judge retorted.\n\n“I think it’s fraudulent, the decision,” Trump said. “The fraud is on the court, not on me.”\n\nMore background: Before and during the trial, Trump has relentlessly attacked James for bringing the case against him. He’s also attacked the judge for being biased against him, and he’s attacked the judge’s law clerk for being biased.\n\nTrump’s conduct at the trial has already been a flashpoint – he’s been fined twice for violating a gag order barring him from speaking about the judge’s staff.\n\nJudge interrupts Trump\'s ""irrelevant"" answer to questions about Scotland golf course valuation\n\nAs testimony began centering on the valuation of Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland — Trump lobbed an answer that Judge Arthur Engoron audibly deemed “irrelevant” to the question.\n\nThe New York assistant attorney general asked Trump if the description in his 2014 financial statement was accurate for the property — which followed by Trump touting Aberdeen as a oil capitol making the property more valuable.\n\n“Irrelevant, irrelevant, answer the question,” Engoron said speaking over Trump, one of the few times that’s happened since returning from the break.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to boast about the course.\n\nAs Trump gave a long-winded answer about the beauty of the course, Engoron said he would be following the assistant attorney general’s lead: “If you want to let the witness ramble on, non responsive, repeat himself.”\n\nThe assistant attorney general was trying, unsuccessfully, to get Trump to acknowledge a discrepancy on the number of properties that could be built in Aberdeen.\n\n“It’s sort of like a painting. You can do pretty much what you want to do. The land is there and you can do what you want to do,” Trump said.\n\nTrump questioned about the value of Mar-a-Lago\n\nDonald Trump says he believes Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\n“You believe that as of today Mar-a-Lago is worth $1.5 billion?” asked Kevin Wallace of the New York attorney general’s office. “I think between a billion and a billion-five,” Trump responded.\n\nThe valuation of Mar-a-Lago has been one of Trump’s complaints about the judge in the trial, after the judge cited a Florida tax appraisal of $18 million for the property in his decision finding Trump, his adult sons and his company committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.\n\nWallace asked Trump if he approved of valuing Mar-a-Lago as if it would be sold to an individual as a resident. “Did I approve it on this? I don’t know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump replied, “I don’t remember that, no” when asked if he explicitly told former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg or former Trump Organization executive Jeff McConney to value the property that way.\n\nWallace confronted Trump with a 2002 deed of development rights that shows Trump deeded away his right to use the property as anything other than a social club.\n\nTrump then gave a long aside about Mar-a-Lago when Wallace asked him about not being able to use it as anything but a social club.\n\n“I don’t mind leaving it as a club. In fact, if somebody wanted it, smartest thing to do, have a club and have one member and that would be the member that lives in the club. But it’s much more valuable — and we’ll show that in two weeks or five weeks or nine weeks or whenever this thing goes — that its biggest value is using it as a club,” Trump said.\n\nWallace showed Trump a 2003 article in which the former president told a reporter Mar-A-Lago will always be a club.\n\n“I think that was said with bravado more than legal intent,” Trump said on the stand.\n\nTestimony centers on contested triplex apartment valuation\n\nTestimony has shifted to the contested valuation of the Trump Tower apartment, including its size — all part of the New York attorney general’s office claims that it was inflated in value.\n\nSupporting data for a 2017 financial statement shows the property value on the triplex apartment dropped from $327 million in 2016, to roughly $116.8 million in 2017 — a significant drop around the time that Forbes Magazine outed Trump for claiming the apartment was more than 30,000 square feet when it turned out to be just under 11,000 square feet.\n\nUnder direct questioning, Trump was asked by the assistant attorney general on whether “this change in valuation” came at his direction.\n\nTrump said that the difference in cost could also be explained by the roof access, and then “it’s not that far off.” He also said they could have made a mistake and there’s a disclaimer clause for that reason.\n\n“There’s a disclaimer clause where you don’t have to get sued by the attorney general of New York,” Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s testimony at fraud trial resumes with questions focused on property valuations\n\nTestimony at Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial resumed after a short, routine break — without issue so far — on the valuations of Trump assets, this time focusing on Seven Springs.\n\nThis time, the former president explained when he believed the valuation of his Seven Springs property was “high” — and further how his company did a conservation easement for tax benefit.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace asked if Trump remembers when he lowered the value of Seven Springs on his financial statement. Trump gave a speech about looking at the statement saying he could probably get that kind of money from the right person.\n\nBut after a follow up question, Trump acknowledged, “I don’t remember” when it was lowered.\n\nTrump confirmed that at one point the Trump Org. did a conservation easement for a tax benefit on the Seven Springs property. He said Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney who testified earlier at trial, handled that process.\n\nTrump said he felt the $291 million value in his 2014 statement was high.\n\n“Well, I thought it was high. When I saw it the statement was done,” Trump said and noted they later dropped the value.\n\nTrump was then asked by Wallace: “Is the Seven Springs easement under review by the IRS?”\n\n“Not that I know,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then was asked about the valuation of the two Vornado properties.\n\n“Do you believe stated value here, $816 million, was based on true and accurate information?” Wallace asked.\n\n“I think so. I hope so,” Trump said. “If you go to 2021, where it’s more familiar to me because it’s more updated, I think that would be a low number.”\n\nTrump ultimately said he was not involved in his 2021 financial statements. “I don’t know that’s when it was in the trust,” Trump said, adding he assumed principals including former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney dealt with that then.\n\nSeven Springs property is in Westchester, New York. It’s one of the properties identified in the lawsuit that the Trumps are accused of inflating.\n\nJudge admonishes Trump to not give speeches in court. Catch up on key moments so far from the testimony\n\nAn hour into his testimony, Donald Trump’s commentary on the witness stand in his civil fraud trial has led to multiple admonishments from Judge Arthur Engoron, who has repeatedly told Trump not to make speeches and just answer questions.\n\nTrump has paid little attention to the judge’s instructions, continuing to give lengthy asides about the values of his properties and his perceived unfairness of the case.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace, who is questioning Trump, has walked Trump through his financial statements from 2014, asking about his role in preparing the valuations of his properties.\n\nTrump has been calm in his responses, but at the same time, he’s given lengthy speeches about the value of his brand and why his properties are worth more than what they were listed for on the statements.\n\nEngoron has repeatedly grown frustrated at Trump’s answers, cutting him off and striking on response from the record.\n\nTrump shook his head with pursed lips. Kise urged the judge to listen to Trump’s response, saying that what he has to say gets to the heart of the case.\n\n“The court needs to hear what he has to say about these statements,” Kise said. “He’s describing to you about why there was no intent to mislead anyone with his answers. That’s what he’s doing.”\n\n“No, I’m not here to hear what he has to say. I’m here to hear him answer questions,” Engoron said in response, raising his voice and telling Trump’s lawyers to “sit down already.”\n\nTrump then piped in before the questions continued: “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching,” he said, leaning into the mic.\n\nWallace has tried to pin Trump down on his involvement in the preparation of his financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges were fraudulently used to obtain better loan rates – and the judge has already ruled constituted fraud.\n\nTrump has given meandering answers in response.\n\n“Well let’s see,” Trump said when he was asked about the valuation of his 40 Wall Street property on his 2014 financial statement.\n\nWallace pressed Trump to focus on the valuation of 40 Wall Street.\n\nTrump eventually answered, “I assume so,” when asked if the 40 Wall Street valuation was based on true and accurate information.\n\nIn response to another question about his role preparing financial statements, Trump said: “I accepted it. Other people did it. But I didn’t say make it higher or make it lower.”\n\nAnalysis: Nobody\'s ever been able to control Trump\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is asking attorney Chris Kise to do something no one or no institution has ever been able to do.\n\n“I beseech you to control him if you can,” Engoron said, after yet another complaint about former President Donald Trump’s jabs at the case against him and extended answers boasting about the quality of his buildings and his own business acumen.\n\nThe judge put his finger on the most critical issue surrounding Trump going forward. The rules of politics, the conventions of the presidency, the constitutional checks on executive power and even the verdict of voters who turfed him out of office could not control Trump, impose upon him or change his behavior.\n\nBut will the legal system in this case, and in four looming criminal trials encompassing more than 90 criminal charges be able to do so?\n\nTrump’s political career and even future liberty could hang on the answer.\n\nIn court Monday, Trump will not allow himself to be dominated, to be constrained by rules or court practice. It’s increasingly infuriating Engoron.\n\nBut this is why Trump’s supporters love him. His contempt for rules, authority and establishment figures is the golden key to his political success. And it’s why he’s leading the polls of the GOP presidential race by miles.\n\nTrump slams proceedings as a ""very unfair trial"" before court adjourns for break\n\nDuring testimony, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone saying, “This is a very unfair trial. Very, very and I hope the public is watching.”\n\nThe court then adjourned for a 15 minute break.\n\nTrump did not speak on his way out of court, but slammed the case on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president is also using his appearance Monday to fundraise.\n\nHis campaign sent out an appeal attacking the trial as election interference, as well as touted a recent New York Times and Siena College poll showing Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden in a series of hypothetical matchups among registered voters in four key swing states.\n\n“Can you believe I have to once again spend yet another day of the election cycle in the courthouse? This is a level of Election Interference never before seen in our country,” the email reads. “But even as I am currently making my way over to the Manhattan Courthouse to take the witness stand as an innocent man, I am still telling you not to lose hope!”\n\nJudge threatens to dismiss Trump and ""draw every negative inference that I can""\n\nAfter another short aside in an answer from Donald Trump, Judge Arthur Engoron told attorney Chris Kise to control the former president or he will be dismissed from the stand.\n\nAsked by Kevin Wallace of the NY attorney general’s office if a statement about 40 Wall Street’s $550 million evaluation is accurate, Trump referred to the legal issue of the statute of limitations.\n\n“Five year statute of limitation. You’re still on 2014,” Trump said.\n\nEngoron wasn’t pleased: “Mr. Kise that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can’t I will. I will I excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can.”\n\nTrump said he had responsibility of providing information pertaining to Trump Org.\'s 2014 financial statement\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was asked about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition — which the former president said he did bear responsibility with regards to providing information. “Getting them information, yes,” he testified.\n\nTrump then added that if his accounting firm, Mazars, “had a problem with it, they wouldn’t have done the statement.”\n\nThe New York attorney general’s attorney questioned Trump on his responsibility for the statements based on this caveat in the statement: “Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement.”\n\nThis line of questioning was interrupted when the judge had to engage with Trump and again ask him to answer the questions.\n\nTrump went on to say he would tell anyone at Trump Organization to give information to Mazars when they asked for information to complete the statement of financial condition, but “principally” he said, former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and ex-Trump Org. executive Jeff McConney took care of it.\n\nWhat the scene is like inside the courtroom as Trump takes the stand\n\nIt was an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump took the witness stand a bit ago in New York. The former president slowly climbed a couple of steps into the box and raised his hand to take the oath.\n\nFormer presidents are typically surrounded by a force-field of deference, due to their status and are accompanied everywhere by Secret Service agents.\n\nBut Trump, in a blue suit, shirt and blue tie rather than his typical campaign uniform of white shirt and red tie, is sitting in the witness box alone in a leather chair, with wood panels on either side. His hands are clasped in his lap, and a large bottle of water and two smaller ones are to his left beside a screen allowing him to see court documents.\n\nThis is a civil trial rather than a criminal one. And the American people can’t see it because it’s not televised. But this the moment when the reality of the 2024 campaign hit home. Trump is simultaneously a multiple defendant, as well as being the Republican front-runner and potential next US president.\n\nThis is the most extraordinary campaign in modern history in microcosm.\n\nTrump says he would on occasion make suggestions on financial docs at heart of the trial\n\nFurther questioning in today’s civil fraud trial turned toward the financial documents at the heart of the trial, with Donald Trump saying he would look at financial statements, and on occasion make suggestions.\n\nTrump says of his statements of financial condition, “I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe on occasion have some suggestions.”\n\nThe former president says that bankers didn’t pay much attention to his financial statements, and says that is going to be part of their defense.\n\n“We’ll explain that as this trial goes along. This crazy trial goes along. Because we’re bringing in the bankers. Very big bankers,” Trump says. “They will explain exactly what their process is.”\n\n“They were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to. They looked at the deal,” he testified.\n\nNOW: Trump takes the stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is testifying under oath in the New York civil fraud trial against him.\n\nThe $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office alleges Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n\nKevin Wallace is questioning Trump for the the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe case is civil, not criminal, but threatens Trump’s family business in New York.\n\nTrump’s testimony Monday will be the first chance to see how he responds in the face of hostile questioning, a precursor to the four criminal trials he faces next year as he campaigns to regain the presidency.\n\nThe trial is not televised, but Trump’s appearance on the witness stand will mark arguably the highest-profile moment of his 2024 presidential campaign – a campaign in which Trump has repeatedly cited his own legal peril as a key reason voters should return him to the White House.\n\nTrump has entered the courtroom ahead of his expected testimony at his civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke in the hallway flanked by his attorneys Chris Kise and Alina Habba before entering the courtroom.\n\nTrump railed against the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling it an “unfair situation” and “really election interference.”\n\n“We will go along, and we will hopefully do very well in every regard, and we will win the election, we will make America great again,” he added.\n\nAttorneys for both sides are inside the courtroom ahead of expected testimony from Trump in his civil fraud trial.\n\nJames entered court before them and walked over to the area where her attorneys gathered to speak with them.\n\nTwo of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers – Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles — are also in court. They are representing Trump in the New York district attorney’s criminal case involving an alleged 2016 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe courtroom is full, mostly with reporters.\n\nThere are a few rows for the public. Attorney General James waved to someone in those rows.\n\nNY attorney general says she expects Trump will attack case in testimony but all ""that matters are the facts""\n\nSpeaking outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trump is expected to testify shortly in the civil fraud trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James said “before [Trump] takes the stand I am certain that he will engage in name-calling and taunts and race-baiting, and call this a witch hunt.”\n\nJames said the former president has “repeatedly and consistently misrepresented and inflated the value of his assets.”\n\nTrump arrives to court ahead of testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has arrived at a New York courthouse to face questions in the $250 million civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nTrump en route to court to testify in civil fraud trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now heading to the courthouse where he will take the stand and testify in the New York attorney general’s ongoing civil fraud trial against him and his business.\n\nCourt is expected to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nJudge overseeing Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order on Friday\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial expanded the gag order in the trial to extend to Trump’s attorneys after they raised multiple questions about the judge’s communications with his law clerk.\n\nIn a written order Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron prohibited Trump’s attorneys from making any further comments about confidential communications between the judge and his staff inside or outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe judge said violating the order would result in “serious sanctions.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-testifies-new-york-fraud-trial/', 'Headline': 'Trump clashes with judge, defends business record in testimony at New ...', 'Snippet': ""Trump takes stand in New York fraud trial 03:58.

Here’s a look at how many people attended those rallies, crowd size photos, and what happened at each.\n\nBiden Hosted a Socially Distanced, Drive-In Rally Attended By Close to 300 Cars\n\nBiden hosted a rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds. Unlike Trump’s rally, Biden’s was a drive-in rally that enforced social distancing. NBC News reported that Biden’s rally was attended by close to 300 cars.\n\nWhen Biden spoke in Tampa on Thursday evening, he said that Trump had just hosted “a superspreader event here again. He’s spreading more than just the virus, he’s spreading division,” he said.\n\nBiden also advocated for wearing masks. “This isn’t a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty,” he said. “But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science.”\n\nWhile Trump’s rally earlier in the day used water hoses to help cool down supporters, Biden’s rally was interrupted by a heavy downpour of rain, which led to the rally ending early, NBC News reported. Biden told the crowd that he was shortening his speech. “Get out of the rain!” he advised.\n\nBiden spoke about topics like healthcare, the pandemic, and taxes. Supporters honked in their cars to show support.\n\nBiden’s rally enforced social distancing, shared Angie Angers of Bay News 9.

Below are our key takeaways.', 'Full_text': '1. ‘Potus im sure is loving this’: Mid-riot text adds to suggestions of Trump’s approval\n\nThe committee has focused extensively on then-President Donald Trump’s inaction as the riot was taking place. But it has occasionally suggested that he might have approved of what was happening or at least seen some political upside in it.\n\nAnd the final report contains more grist for that mill: One of the most striking new revelations is a text message from a Trump aide, Robert Gabriel. At 2:49 p.m., as the Capitol was under siege, Gabriel texted, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\nThe text builds upon previously known evidence.\n\nShortly after Jan. 6, 2021, and amid Trump’s impeachment, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) relayed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had said Trump told McCarthy during the riot, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nWhite House aide Sarah Matthews has said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told her that Trump resisted calling on the rioters to be “peaceful” in a tweet. (In texts from the time and in later testimony to the committee, Trump aide Hope Hicks also said that, before Jan. 6, both she and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann called for Trump to preemptively urge peacefulness, but that Trump “refused.”)\n\nWhite House aide Cassidy Hutchinson has also testified that, amid a frantic effort to get Trump to act, she overheard chief of staff Mark Meadows telling White House counsel Pat Cipollone, “He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat.”\n\nThe committee pressed Cipollone on whether Trump actually wanted people to leave the Capitol. Cipollone had said he couldn’t think of anyone on staff who didn’t want the rioters to leave. But when asked whether Trump shared in that opinion, Cipollone struggled with the question and ultimately punted, saying he couldn’t “reveal communications” with Trump, citing executive privilege.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. New details on the ‘fake elector’ plot\n\nOne of the committee’s criminal referrals hones in on the effort to appoint alternate Trump electors (also known as “fake electors”) in key states. And a key question has been: What was the intent behind their appointment?\n\nThe Trump campaign pitched these electors as just a contingency — i.e., they needed to be in place by the Dec. 14 deadline, just in case a given state changed course and declared Trump the winner of their electoral votes. But there has been evidence that some of the architects of the plot planned to deploy the electors regardless, in a much more desperate and forceful ploy to overturn legitimate election results.\n\nSome of the fake electors were apparently concerned about the strategy, or even saw something unsavory ahead. In newly revealed evidence, Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt texted his party’s executive director in late November and said, “I hope they are not planning on asking us to do anything like try and say we are only the proper electors.” He added on Dec. 12 after receiving a message about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: “These guys are up to no good and its gonna fail miserably.” Hitt signed on as a Trump elector anyway.\n\nOther electors clearly worried about legal liability, insisting (in New Mexico and Pennsylvania) that the documents listing them specify that they were only legitimate if their states’ election results were overturned. But most documents made no such distinction.\n\nThe committee also detailed new evidence linking Giuliani, Trump and Meadows to the early fake-elector effort. Trump campaign lawyer Joshua Findlay testified that “it was my understanding that the President made” the decision to have someone look into the feasibility of appointing alternative electors around Dec. 7 or 8.\n\n3. Some notable recommendations — including on 14th Amendment\n\nOn Monday, the committee took the historic step of referring Trump and others to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But the report features some other recommendations, including one that had been floated after Jan. 6: possibly disqualifying Trump and others from holding office.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution says that anyone who has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States can be barred from holding office. (This law has been invoked in unsuccessful efforts to bar some GOP lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from office.)\n\nTrump’s second impeachment featured a historic number of members of the president’s own party voting in favor. And some Democrats and watchdogs continue to argue for Trump to be barred from office. But with Republicans taking over the House in early January — and even Democrats generally having shown little appetite for this step before — it appears unlikely Congress will take up this proposal.\n\nThe report also advises that congressional committees look into media and social media companies whose policies have “have had the effect of radicalizing their consumers, including by provoking people to attack their own country.” And it recommends possible safeguards against a president misusing the Insurrection Act, which some Trump allies floated.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It suggests Trump defamed Dominion\n\nSome have questioned why, though Fox News and others have found themselves under legal scrutiny, Trump himself isn’t the focus of high-profile lawsuits aimed at those who spread lies and misinformation about voting machines. (Legal experts disagree on the strength of the potential legal case a plaintiff would have against him.)\n\nThe report lays out how Trump was repeatedly told what he was saying about Dominion voting machines was false, even as he continued to spout the claims. And it suggests Trump meets the test for defaming Dominion.\n\n“President Trump’s own campaign staff, administration officials, and State officials, all told him the claims had no merit. Hand recounts confirmed the fidelity of the machines,"" the report says. ""But none of this overwhelming evidence mattered. President Trump demonstrated a conscious disregard for the facts and continued to maliciously smear Dominion.”\n\nThe language here is deliberate: Legally speaking, the “actual malice” standard for defamation requires proving that the person either knew what they were saying was false or showed a reckless disregard for whether it were true.\n\nThe report highlights previously known evidence about the various advisors and government officials who either tried to dissuade Trump from this theory, or knew that others had. It also added a new name this week: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who confirmed she had tried unsuccessfully to wave Trump off the theory.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, White House press aide Sarah Matthews also testified that McEnany “actively” resisted Trump’s attempts to get her to bring up the conspiracy theory in media interviews and hold White House briefings on the subject.\n\n5. The extent of Trump’s pressure campaign in key states\n\nWe’ve known that Trump and his allies pressured lawmakers and officials far and wide to help overturn the election results in key states. But the report lays out the vast scale of this effort.\n\nIt says, “President Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.”\n\nWhat qualifies as “targeting” an official is, of course, subjective. But several officials indicate they felt the pressure.\n\nThen-Michigan state House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said he received between five and 10 phone calls from Trump after the election. Chatfield said he repeatedly informed Trump he had seen nothing that would overturn Trump’s nearly three-point deficit in the state, and he and state Senate President Mike Shirkey (R) put out a statement saying as much after a meeting with Trump.\n\nBut the Trump campaign on Jan. 3 tweeted that people should contact Chatfield or the GOP leader of the state Senate, Mike Shirkey, to “Demand [a] vote on decertification."" Trump’s social media team promoted Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield that turned out to be wrong. Shirkey said he received 4,000 text messages. Chatfield testified, ""I and my family have received numerous threats, along with members on both sides of the aisle.”\n\nThe report details dozens of officials who were threatened, though not all were targeted by Trump personally. The chairman of the Maricopa County, Ariz., board of supervisors, Clint Hickman (R), said “the threats never abated.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Little focus on security issues, while mostly blaming Trump\n\nThe Washington Post reported in November that some committee members and staffers on the Jan. 6 committee were upset that Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wanted the report to focus so extensively on Trump. Well, the final product appears to reflect Cheney’s desires.\n\nThe report says relatively little about the security failures that had been the focus of some congressional probing. It mostly relegates those findings to the first appendix — about 30 pages long — near the end of the report. For example, it does little to reconcile conflicting timelines presented by key officials when it comes to when the National Guard was requested and approved.\n\nBut the verdict is rather damning, saying these failures also put lives in danger.\n\nThe report says that, before Jan. 6, both federal and local law enforcement had intelligence predicting violence that day. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.” the report says. “The failure to sufficiently share and act upon that intelligence jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\nIn the next breath, though, the report emphasizes Trump’s culpability and says that better planning might not have been able to account for the violence he would stoke.\n\n7. The full picture of an allegedly corrupt plot\n\nThe chief alleged crime the committee has focused on is what’s known as obstruction of an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’s counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. And showing that requires proving Trump acted corruptly.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth running through all the evidence — most of it previously established, but some new — that this plot was corrupt. The committee has keyed on a few things: that Trump was told his voter-fraud theories were false, that he actually knew he had lost the 2020 election, and that the participants in the plot knew it was illegal.\n\nIn addition to the previously-known figures who said they pushed back on Trump’s theories internally, the committee revealed this week that White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien testified about a Dec. 18 Oval Office phone call in which he said that there was no evidence of fraud using voting machines or foreign interference. Cipollone also testified that the lack of sufficient evidence was made clear internally “over and over again.”\n\nIncluding an official in Raffensperger’s office, the report details at least eight officials testifying that Trump and his team were informed his theories were false.\n\nAs for Trump admitting he lost: Hutchinson and another former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin have both said they heard about Trump doing so. And in a transcript released this week, Hutchinson said she asked Meadows, point blank, whether Trump knew he lost. According to Hutchinson, Meadows “said something to the effect of, ‘he knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying. There’s a chance he didn’t lose. I want to pull this off for him.”\n\nPrevious evidence also showed some of those involved admitted their plot was illegal or might not pass legal muster. That includes contemporaneous documents from Eastman, and testimony from Pence aide Greg Jacob and White House lawyer Eric Herschmann about their interactions with Eastman, and Giuliani, respectively, who they said admitted their case would lose in court. And in October, a judge ruled that Trump had knowingly signed a verification containing false voter-fraud figures that Eastman had admitted were wrong.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. What the report doesn’t shed light on\n\nThe scale of the investigation was massive, and many witnesses weren’t particularly forthcoming, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or, in some cases, not testifying at all. That means that some of the angles probed by the committee remain unresolved or disputed. Among them:\n\n- The committee didn’t resolve what happened in the presidential vehicle after Trump’s speech. Hutchinson had testified that White House aide Anthony M. Ornato told her that Trump became irate and lunged at the head of his Secret Service detail, Bobby Engel, when Engel wouldn’t bring him to the Capitol. (She emphasized that her account was secondhand.) Ornato said he didn’t recall conveying that information to Hutchinson, according to the committee. The committee confirmed with other witnesses that Trump was angry, but they did not confirm a physical altercation. In the end, the report says it was “difficult to fully reconcile the accounts of several of the witnesses who provided information with what we heard from Engel and Ornato.”\n\n- Some congressional Democrats suggested shortly after Jan. 6 that certain Republicans provided reconnaissance tours to rioters before Jan. 6. And more specifically, the committee raised questions about a tour Rep. Barry Loudermilk(R-Ga.) led on Jan. 5, which Loudermilk struggled to explain. But the report doesn’t dwell upon this at all. It merely mentions that one of Loudermilk’s guests who was captured on video at Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 “took pictures of hallways and staircases,” which was previously known.\n\n- Hutchinson testified that Trump was told people at his speech were found with weapons but was unconcerned — and even asked that security stop using magnetometers. This is a key piece of evidence, since Trump would later direct these people to the Capitol. Hutchinson said Trump justified his lack of concern by saying, “They’re not here to hurt me.” The report doesn’t confirm that Trump was told about the weapons, but it does say Engel recalled Trump making a similar comment, as Trump was trying to persuade Engel to take him to the Capitol.\n\ncorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated that it had been more than a century since the 14th Amendment was used to bar someone from public office. In September, a New Mexico judge used it to disqualify an Otero County commissioner.

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-committee-report-executive-summary-key-findings-trump/', 'Headline': 'The 17 key findings from the executive summary of the Jan. 6 committee ...', 'Snippet': ""Washington — The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol voted Monday to adopt the final report of its probe, which includes 17 takeaways related to former President Donald Trump's efforts to remain in power.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/politics/jan-6-report-key-takeaways/index.html', 'Headline': 'Key takeaways from the January 6 committee’s final report', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, laid out a damning case over 800-plus pages that former President Donald Trump’ s efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to the violence at the US Capitol, documenting the ex-chief executive’s actions for the record and potentially for criminal investigators.'}, 5: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/us/politics/jan-6-committee-key-findings.html', 'Headline': 'Key Findings From the Jan. 6 Committee’s Report, Annotated', 'Snippet': 'The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol outlined 17 specific findings on Monday in the executive summary of its final report.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues “on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.”\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has “not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.”\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or “coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies” and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ocregister.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/?lctg=345D5512A48443872362D3B76D&active=no', 'Headline': 'Anaheim is being sued by GOP Reps.

Gen. Keith Kellogg said last week that former President Donald Trump did in fact request National Guard troops be deployed in Washington D.C. before the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Kellogg said he was present at the time of Trump’s request, and Congress should release his testimony to the public.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he requested National Guard troops be activated in D.C. to provide security as he called on supporters to gather in D.C. to protest the certification of the 2020 election results for Joe Biden. Trump’s claim has been substantiated by members of his administration, but rejected by some members of Congress.\n\nKellogg, who was serving as Vice President Mike Pence’s National Security Advisor at the time of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol breach, tweeted last week, “To be clear on 6 Jan/NG. Pg 199 of my book, ‘On 3 Jan the President asked the Def Dept to deploy NG troops’ into DC for J6 contingencies. OK for J6 Cmte to publicly release my full sworn testimony. Release Army Guard and DC Mayor J6 testimonies as well. Would be illuminating.”\n\nKellogg now serves as the co-chairman of the America First Policy Institute’s (AFPI) Center for American Security.\n\nAccording to an initial timeline published by the U.S. Capitol Police, a Pentagon employee named Carol Corbin reached out to Capitol Police Deputy Chief Sean Gallagher on Jan. 2, 2021 to determine whether Capitol Police were considering a request for National Guard soldiers in anticipation of planned election protest events on January 6. Gallagher replied on Jan. 3 that the Capitol Police were not planning to make such a request.\n\nAccording to a Department of Defense Inspector General report from November, Trump asked acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley on Jan. 3 about preparations for election protests on Jan. 6.\n\n“The President told Mr. Miller that there would be a large number of protestors on January 6, 2021,” the DoD report states. “And Mr. Miller should ensure sufficient National Guard or Soldiers would be there to make sure it was a safe event. Gen Milley told us that Mr. Miller responded, ‘We’ve got a plan and we’ve got it covered.'”\n\nMiller testified to Congress in May of 2021 that Trump also asked him if D.C.’s mayor had requested any National Guard troops and instructed him to “fill” a request.\n\nA recent Washington Times op-ed criticized the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. The op-ed said the select committee does not have legitimate Republican representation. Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Liz Cheney (R-WY) are the only two Republicans currently allowed on the committee.\n\nDavid Bossie, who wrote the Washington Times op-ed noted Jan. 3 conversation between Trump and Miller and said the Jan. 6 select committee is “crafting a narrative that doesn’t quite add up and omits important facts that would not stand if there were proper Republican representation on the committee.”\n\nBossie was deputy campaign manager of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKellogg responded to Bossie’s op-ed in a tweet Friday, saying, “Great OpEd. Reinforces my earlier comment on 6 Jan Cmte. Has quote from DOD IG Report regarding 3 Jan 2021 meeting with Actg Def Secy Miller/CJCS Milley in the Oval on the 6 Jan NG request by POTUS on troops needed.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://thedispatch.com/article/fact-check-did-pelosi-reject-trumps-request-for-national-guard-troops-on-january-6/', 'Headline': 'Fact Check: Did Pelosi Reject Trump’s Request for National Guard Troops ...', 'Snippet': 'A viral Instagram post from Donald Trump Jr. claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused Donald Trump’s “request for a national guard presence” during the January 6 Capitol insurrection.

But no federal or state laws barred possession of cannons at the time, experts have said. Individuals actually could get special waivers to use privately owned ships carrying cannons during wartime.\n\nHe also said of gun manufacturers, “They’re the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public.” Federal law shields gun makers from some civil lawsuits, but not all. Other industries have certain legal protections, too.\n\nThe president made those claims during the meeting in New York City with federal, state and local officials. He spoke about new actions the Justice Department plans to take as part of a multipart plan to combat and reduce gun crime across the country.\n\nClaim About Cannons\n\nTo support his argument that the Second Amendment has always allowed for regulating the kinds of firearms and weapons that individuals can possess, Biden offered a historical example about cannons that is not accurate.\n\n“When the amendment was passed, it didn’t say anybody can own a gun and any kind of gun and any kind of weapon,” the president said about the Second Amendment, which was adopted as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791. “You couldn’t buy a cannon when this amendment was passed. So no reason why you should be able to buy certain assault weapons.”\n\nAs other fact-checkers noted when Biden made versions of this claim at least twice before, nothing in the Second Amendment said that citizens could not own cannons, and there is no evidence that any federal or state laws barred possession of the weapons at the time, experts have said.\n\nThe text of the Second Amendment — which is only 27 words long — states: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\n\nIn addition, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and “grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,” as the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out in its June 2021 fact-checking article on the subject. The letters are a type of license or waiver that authorized citizens to use their privately owned and operated ships, which could carry cannons, to raid and capture enemy vessels on behalf of the government at times of war.\n\nThose ships, also known as privateers, played a key role in the War of 1812 against Great Britain.\n\nAlthough he was wrong about a past ban on cannons, experts have said there is support for Biden’s broader point about the government’s ability to regulate weapons.\n\nLast summer, when Biden claimed that the Second Amendment limited the kinds of weapons that could be owned and specifically cited cannons, Saul Cornell, a professor of history at Fordham University, wrote: “While Biden’s specific claim was wrong and poorly worded, he could have easily made his point by saying something like the following: At the time of the Second Amendment, there was nothing to prevent government from regulating arms, including dangerous or unusual weapons.”\n\nCornell added, “Sir William Blackstone, one of the most important legal commentators on English law, expressly stated this principle in his Commentaries, a text that Justice Antonin Scalia quoted in his opinion recognizing an individual right to own a firearm in District of Columbia v. Heller.”\n\nIn the majority opinion from that 2008 case, Scalia wrote: “Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”\n\nWhen we asked Cornell about Biden’s Feb. 3 cannon claim, he said in an email, “Again, wrong on the specifics, but generally correct about the larger legal question.”\n\nClaim About Gun Manufacturers\n\nBiden also repeated another false talking point about the gun industry that he and other politicians have used before.\n\n“I’ll keep doing everything in my power to make sure that communities are safer,” Biden said. “But Congress needs to do its part too: pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, close loopholes, and keep out of the hands of domestic abusers — weapons, repeal the liability shield for gun manufacturers.”\n\nHe continued: “They’re the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public. The only one.”\n\nBut gun manufacturers are not completely shielded from civil lawsuits, as we have written before. Also, the gun industry is not the only industry that federal law protects from at least some kinds of tort lawsuits, which allow plaintiffs to try to recoup money from defendants for damages.\n\nTo Biden’s point, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued over the misuse of guns or ammunition.\n\nHowever, the law included six exceptions where civil lawsuits could still be brought, as the Congressional Research Service has explained. The exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.\n\nIn November 2019, for instance, the Supreme Court declined to dismiss a 2014 lawsuit that several families of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting filed against Remington Arms Co. for the way it marketed the assault-style rifle that was used to kill 20 children and six adults in the 2012 school shooting. A Connecticut judge later ruled that the case would proceed to trial.\n\nIn July 2021, Remington offered the families nearly $33 million to settle — but the case is still pending.\n\nAs for other industries with certain legal protections, we have written about broad liability exemptions for vaccine manufacturers and administrators, for example.\n\nIn a May 2020 legal brief, the Congressional Research Service said that the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act “shields manufacturers, distributors, healthcare providers, and other entities from liability for injuries resulting from the use or administration of certain medical products during a public health emergency,” including the COVID-19 pandemic. “The sole exception to PREP Act immunity is for death or serious physical injury caused by ‘willful misconduct,’” another CRS report says.\n\nHowever, individuals who die or are seriously injured due to the administration of a covered product may be eligible to receive compensation through the federal Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/qa-on-bidens-gun-proposals/', 'Headline': ""Q&A on Biden's Gun Proposals - FactCheck.org"", 'Snippet': 'In 2020, there were 45,222 firearm deaths in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The chart below shows the firearm death rates by type of injury from 1981 to 2020.\n\nOver that time period, the rates were highest at 15.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 population in 1993, 7.6 for suicides in 1990 and 7 for homicides in 1991.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden noted that CDC data showed “guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America.” An analysis of the CDC data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 19, determined firearm injuries were the leading cause of death for those ages 1 through 19 in 2020. Dating back to 1999, the data had previously found guns were the second-leading cause of death, behind automobile crashes.\n\nHow many mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. over time, and this year alone?\n\nIt depends on how one defines “mass shooting.” According to a database compiled by the magazine Mother Jones, there have been at least 129 public mass shootings since 1982, with more than half of those occurring since 2013. This year alone, there have been four: in Sacramento, Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa. However, by different criteria, there have been 18 mass shootings this year.\n\nMother Jones’ database includes attacks in public places, typically by a sole perpetrator, in which three or more victims were killed, and prior to 2013, it included such attacks in which four or more victims were killed — metrics that federal law enforcement have used for mass killings during those time periods. The database focuses on indiscriminate shootings in public places, and it doesn’t include killings mostly linked to gang activity or robberies, or those in private homes.\n\nIncluding any shooting involving three or more victims killed, regardless of the other circumstances, would increase the number of “mass shootings” considerably. There were 18 such shootings this year alone, according to a database compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Those incidents include a Jan. 23 shooting in which six people were killed in a house in Milwaukee and a March 12 shooting on the streets of Baltimore that left three men dead.\n\nIn his June 2 speech, Biden used a broader definition of mass shooting, saying: “Since Uvalde, just over a week ago, there have been 20 other mass shootings in America, each with four or more people killed or injured, including yesterday at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.” That’s the criteria used by the Gun Violence Archive — four or more victims shot, whether killed or injured, not including the shooter. So far in 2022, the research organization has found 233 shootings meet that definition, and yes, there have been 20 such shootings since the elementary school massacre in Uvalde.\n\nAs for mass school shootings, there have been 19 since 1982, with 197 victims killed, according to Mother Jones’ database.\n\nHow do background checks work, and how are Democrats proposing to expand them?\n\nThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires that all guns obtained from a federally licensed firearms dealer include a background check. When a customer applies to buy a gun from the dealer, the seller has to run that person’s name and other identifying information through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, an electronic system that verifies buyers do not have a reported criminal record or mental health issue that makes them ineligible to purchase or own firearms.\n\nBut not all gun sales or transfers go through licensed dealers, and in some states, background checks are not required for such private sales between unlicensed individuals, including some sales on the internet or at gun shows.\n\nMost congressional Democrats want that to change.\n\nIn March 2021, the Democrat-controlled House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, by a vote of227-203, mostly along partisan lines. Eight Republicans supported it, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nAs we’ve written, the bill seeks to expand the background check requirements to almost all gun transfers, including those between private parties. It would require firearm transfers between private parties to be handled by a federally licensed dealer, who would take possession of the firearm while the background check is being conducted.\n\nThere would be exceptions to the policy, such as loans or gifts between family members and temporary transfers to people in situations of self-defense or at a shooting range.\n\nMost congressional Democrats also want to extend the time required to conduct a background check before a gun can be given to a buyer.\n\nUnder current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer can transfer a weapon to a purchaser in what is called a “default proceed,” if the background check cannot be completed in three business days.\n\nBut in March of last year, 217 House Democrats and two House Republicans voted to pass H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. That bill would increase the window to conduct a background check to a minimum of 10 business days. If the background check still remains incomplete after 10 days, the purchaser can submit a petition for a final determination. If another 10 days pass without a decision, the firearms can then be transferred to the prospective purchaser.\n\nOnly two Democrats voted against the legislation.\n\nHowever, neither H.R. 8 nor H.R. 1446 has received a vote in the evenly divided Senate, where at least 60 votes are necessary to avoid a potential filibuster of either bill.\n\nWhat states have red-flag laws?\n\nIn his speech, the president called for a “federal red-flag law.”\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already have so-called red-flag laws in place, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates gun control laws. The states are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAlso known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPO, red-flag laws allow certain people — usually just law enforcement officers, family or household members — “to petition a court to order that firearms be temporarily taken or kept away from someone who poses a risk of committing gun violence,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2019 report.\n\n“ERPO laws are designed to respond to acute periods of elevated risk of violence by authorizing a temporary ban on new firearm purchases and the temporary removal of firearms currently in an individual’s possession,” the RAND Corporation explains in a 2020 report as part of its Gun Policy in America initiative.\n\nThirteen of the 19 states and the District of Columbia “allow family or household members as well as law enforcement to submit a petition” for a protection order, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\n“Five states limit the category of petitioners to law enforcement only,” the center says. “Indiana has a risk-based firearm removal law that is similar to law enforcement-only ERPOs.”\n\nThe president suggested he would seek an expansive federal red-flag law.\n\n“We should also have national red-flag laws so that a parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for a court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves or to others,” Biden said.\n\nA few states do allow some people other than law enforcement and family or household members to petition for a protection order. For example, “Maryland and DC … allow mental health providers to petition; New York … allows school administrators to petition; and Hawaii … allows medical professionals, coworkers, and educators to petition,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn an article last year, the Wall Street Journal found that state red-flag laws were used about 5,000 times in 2020 — most often in Florida, where the law was used 2,355 times. Florida passed the law after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others.\n\n“Florida’s law authorizes law enforcement agencies to petition a court for a civil order preventing a person from accessing firearms for up to one year,” according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a review of existing studies on the effects of red-flag laws, the RAND Corporation found in its 2020 report that there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of extreme risk protection orders on total and firearm suicides.”\n\nHow many states have ‘safe storage’ laws?\n\nThe president said there should be “safe storage laws and personal liability for not locking up your gun,” which he said the House is planning to address.\n\nGenerally, safe storage means that gun owners keep their firearms locked in a safe or use a safety device when not being used. The intent is to keep the weapons away from those who are not supposed to possess them, including minors.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires gun owners to store guns securely; however, importers, manufacturers and dealers must include a gun storage or safety device with handgun sales or transfers in most cases. There are 13 states that have laws concerning either gun storage or firearm locking devices, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nOnly two of those states, Massachusetts and Oregon, generally require all firearms to be stored with a lock in place. Four other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut and New York) impose that requirement in certain situations, such as when gun owners reside with someone prohibited from having a gun.\n\nThe center says the District of Columbia has a nonbinding policy that strongly encourages registrants to keep their firearms unloaded and either disassembled or secured with a trigger lock or in a safe.\n\nIn addition, five states require that locking devices accompany all guns sold by federally licensed dealers, while seven states have that stipulation for dealer sales of certain types of guns. In Ohio, a dealer is only required to offer to sell the purchaser a trigger lock or gun locking device, the center says.\n\nLocking devices may be an external device or a design feature of the firearm.\n\nAs for private sales, only three states require that locking devices accompany all guns in such sales. And three other states require that locking devices accompany private sales of either handguns or assault weapons or both.\n\nIn five of the states that require some or all guns to be sold with locking devices, the locks must be approved or meet state guidelines.\n\nHow many states place restrictions on teens buying rifles, and what are those restrictions?\n\nIn his speech, Biden said his first choice would be a ban on assault weapons, but if that can’t be accomplished, “then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.”\n\n“In Uvalde, the shooter was 17 when he asked his sister to buy him an assault weapon, knowing he’d be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself. She refused,” Biden said. “But as soon as he turned 18, he purchased two assault weapons for himself. Because in Texas, you can be 18 years old and buy an assault weapon even though you can’t buy a pistol in Texas until you’re 21. If we can’t ban assault weapons, as we should, we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21.”\n\n“Look, I know some folks will say, ’18-year-olds can serve in the military and fire those weapons,’” Biden said. “But that’s with training and supervision by the best-trained experts in the world. Don’t tell me raising the age won’t make a difference. Enough.”\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people under 21. But for long guns, including assault rifles, licensed dealers can sell to anyone over the age of 18. Federal law places no minimum age restrictions on the possession of long guns.\n\nHowever, state laws on the issue vary widely.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center, five states prohibit the purchase of long guns, including assault rifles, for people under the age of 21: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont (without a hunting safety certificate). Washington state prohibits the sale of just assault rifles to people under 21.\n\nTwo states, Hawaii and Illinois, also make it illegal for anyone under 21 to possess a long gun. Maryland requires people to be 21 to possess an assault weapon. And Washington state prohibits the possession of semiautomatic rifles by people under the age of 21 when not on private property.\n\nMany of the laws banning sales of rifles to people under 21 are being challenged in court. Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that California’s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under 21 is unconstitutional.\n\n“There’s a big fight brewing over these restrictions on guns for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds because the courts are in the midst of a great expansion of Second Amendment gun rights,” Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who writes about gun policy, told NPR.\n\nLooking at studies researching age requirements for any firearms, not just assault weapons, RAND found“inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements for possessing a firearm affect total homicides, firearm homicides, and other violent crime.”\n\nWe couldn’t find any solid research directly addressing the effect of raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle. But gun control groups like Giffords point to academic research that shows post-adolescent brains have not fully matured, making young adults more prone to involvement in violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting in 2018, then-President Donald Trump expressed support for raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.\n\n“Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I’m saying it anyway,” Trump said. I’m going to just have to say it. But you can’t buy — I mean, think of it. You can buy a handgun — you can’t buy one; you have to wait until you’re 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it’s something you have to think about.”\n\nTrump suggested he was willing to buck the NRA’s opposition to such a law.\n\n“I can say that the NRA is opposed to it,” Trump said. “And I’m a fan of the NRA. I mean, there’s no bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the NRA. … These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18.”\n\nBut he never followed through with backing legislation to accomplish that.\n\nDid the assault weapons ban reduce mass shootings?\n\nAs he has in the past, Biden said in his speech to the nation that the assault weapons ban included in a 1994 crime bill that he sponsored reduced mass shootings.\n\n“And in the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down,” Biden said. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004 and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. Those are the facts.”\n\nBut the facts about the effectiveness of the law on reducing mass shootings aren’t as clear-cut as he presents them.\n\nWe wrote about the effectiveness of the assault weapons ban in 2013 and again in 2021. In both cases, we cited a three-part study authored by Christopher S. Koper and funded by the Department of Justice that concluded in the final report issued in 2004 that the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with prohibited guns was “mixed.”\n\n“Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs [Assault Weapons], any benefits from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics with LCMs [large-capacity magazines], which are used in crime much more frequently than AWs,” Koper wrote. “Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.”\n\n(For more, read our March 26, 2021, article “FactChecking Biden’s Claim that Assault Weapons Ban Worked.”)\n\nAs for whether “mass shootings tripled” since the law expired, we went to a database of mass shootings created and maintained by the magazine Mother Jones. (See the question above on mass shootings for more on the database criteria.)\n\nThe assault weapons ban was in effect from September 1994 to September 2004, during which time there were 15 mass shootings that resulted in 96 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database. That’s an average of 1.5 mass shootings per year and 6.4 deaths per mass shooting incident.\n\nSince then, there were 94 mass shootings, from Dec. 8, 2004, to May 24, 2022, that resulted in 776 deaths. That’s an average of roughly five mass shootings per year and 8.3 deaths per shooting.\n\nBiden’s claim that “mass shootings tripled” since the assault weapons ban expired is supported by at least one measure, although the firearms covered by the 1994 law were not responsible for all of these shootings.\n\nWhat does the research say about effectiveness of banning large-capacity magazines?\n\nBiden also renewed his call for a ban on large-capacity magazines.\n\nThe president praised a bill that passed in the House Judiciary Committee on June 2 that calls for outlawing the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of large-capacity magazines. It would grandfather currently owned large-capacity magazines. The bill — which passed in the committee by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against it — does not call for an outright ban on assault weapons, though it would raise the lawful age to purchase one from 18 to 21.\n\nWe looked at the research into bans on large-capacity magazines in our March 26, 2021, story. We found that while the RAND Corporation’s review of gun studies concluded there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings,” there is growing evidence that banning large-capacity magazines may reduce the number killed and injured in mass shootings.\n\nAlthough there is no established definition, large-capacity magazines generally refer to magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition, essentially allowing a shooter to fire 10 rounds without having to take the time to reload.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the expiration of the assault weapons (and LCM) ban in 2004 did not have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings, the number killed and injured in mass public shootings has increased over the decade after the ban had expired.\n\nAnd research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with significant reductions in the incident of fatal mass shootings.”\n\n“It’s clear that there is an association between weapon features, most notably ammunition capacity, and how many people are shot in these incidents,” Daniel Webster, one of the authors of the study and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us via email at the time. “Shooters select weapons and ammunition feeding devices that will allow them to shoot as many people as possible. It is a separate question whether bans will reduce casualties from mass shootings or how long they need to be in place in order for the effects to be realized.”\n\nIn separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the author of the Department of Justice-funded review of the 1994 assault weapons ban, argued that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”\n\nAn increase in the use of LCMs “would arguably have not happened, or at least not to the same degree, had Congress extended the ban in 2004,” Koper states. “Considering that mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place.”\n\nSpecifically, Koper concluded, “Data on mass shooting incidents suggest these magazine restrictions can potentially reduce mass shooting deaths by 11% to 15% and total victims shot in these incidents by one quarter, likely as upper bounds.”\n\nHow many states ban large-capacity ammunition?\n\nThe federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made it unlawful to “transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device,” but, as we’ve said, that law expired in 2004. Since then, nine states and the District of Columbia have passed laws banning large-capacity magazines: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. All of them except Colorado and Vermont also ban assault weapons.\n\nAccording to a review of state laws on large-capacity magazines by the Giffords Law Center, eight of the nine states prohibit large-capacity ammunition magazines for use with any firearm, while Hawaii’s law only targets large-capacity magazines used with a handgun.\n\nMost states define large-capacity magazines as ones capable of holding more than 10 rounds; in Colorado, it’s more than 15 rounds. And Vermont draws a distinction for long guns (more than 10 rounds) and handguns (more than 15 rounds).\n\nAmong the states that ban large-capacity magazines, there are also differences in prohibited activities, such as possession, transfer, manufacture, purchase and importation. The most comprehensive bans — prohibiting possession, manufacture and transfer (including sale) of large-capacity magazines — are in California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.\n\nAnd finally, there are differences between the states regarding whether they exempted magazines owned prior to enactment of the bans — in other words whether they grandfathered existing magazines.\n\nCalifornia, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York did not grandfather LCMs, meaning that large-capacity magazines owned prior to the bans had to be destroyed, converted to a lower capacity, turned in to law enforcement, or transferred to a dealer or out of state. New York gives an owner 30 days after being notified by law enforcement about the ban to get rid of the banned magazines. Connecticut requires grandfathered magazines to be registered, while Colorado, Massachusetts and Vermont all exempted possession of magazines owned prior to enactment of their bans. Maryland does not prohibit possession of large-capacity magazines, only the manufacture and transfer of them.\n\nWhat liability protections do gun manufacturers have?\n\nBiden again called for repealing “the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons.” He added: “They’re the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity. Imagine — imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued — where we’d be today.”\n\nIt’s a fact that federal law protects gun makers from most civil lawsuits. However, other industries, such as vaccine manufacturers and administrators, also receive certain liability protections, contrary to what Biden said.\n\nAs we’ve reported, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does largely prevent licensed manufacturers, dealers, sellers of firearms or ammunition, and trade associations from being sued for “criminal or unlawful” misuse of a gun or ammunition. But there are six exceptions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence, cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime, and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/sep/18/kevin-mccarthy/largest-share-of-foreign-payments-went-to-biden-as/', 'Headline': 'Largest share of foreign payments went to Biden associates, not kin ...', 'Snippet': 'The bank records show neither evidence that foreign payments went to President Joe Biden nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president. ...

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/01/hhs-proposes-minimum-staffing-standards-enhance-safety-quality-in-nursing-homes.html', 'Headline': 'HHS Proposes Minimum Staffing Standards to Enhance Safety and Quality ...', 'Snippet': 'Builds on President Biden’s Historic Commitment to Create a Long-Term Care System Where People Can Live with Dignity .

This proposed rule builds on the President’s historic Action Plan for Nursing Home Reform launched in the 2022 State of the Union.\n\nToday’s action is one among many advanced by the Biden-Harris Administration to build a long-term care system where all older Americans can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high quality services in the setting of their choice, where family caregivers are adequately supported, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\n“Establishing minimum staffing standards for nursing homes will improve resident safety and promote high-quality care so residents and their families can have peace of mind,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer. They might be unable to use the bathroom, shower, maintain hygiene, change clothes, get out of bed, or have someone respond to their call for assistance. Comprehensive staffing reforms can improve working conditions, leading to higher wages and better retention for this dedicated workforce.”\n\n“CMS is proud to be leading the President’s initiative to improve the lives of over 1.2 million residents who reside in Medicare and Medicaid-certified long-term care facilities, and those who will need that care in the future,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Today, we took an important first step to propose new staffing requirements that will hold nursing homes accountable and make sure that residents get the safe, high-quality care that they deserve.”\n\nUnder CMS’s proposal, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid would be required to meet specific nurse staffing levels that promote safe, high-quality care for residents. Nursing homes would need to provide residents with a minimum of 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident per day, and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident per day, exceeding existing standards in nearly all states. CMS estimates approximately three quarters (75%) of nursing homes would have to strengthen staffing in their facilities. As the long-term care sector continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed standards take into consideration local realities in rural and underserved communities through staggered implementation and exemptions processes.\n\nIn addition, nursing homes would also be required to ensure a registered nurse is on site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and to complete robust facility assessments on staffing needs. Facilities would continue to be required to provide staffing that meets the needs of the individual residents they serve, which may require higher levels of staffing above the proposed minimum standards.\n\nCMS also proposes to require states to collect and report on compensation for workers as a percentage of Medicaid payments for those working in nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These policies build on CMS’ recent proposals to support compensation for direct care workers in home- and community-based settings and to publish Medicaid data on average hourly pay rates for home care workers. This enhanced transparency will aid efforts to support and stabilize the long-term care workforce across settings. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to strengthening access to high-quality long-term care both at home, in the community as well as in nursing homes and other facilities.\n\nAdditionally, CMS announced a national campaign to support staffing in nursing homes. As part of the HHS Workforce Initiative, CMS will work with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other partners to make it easier for individuals to enter careers in nursing homes, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as scholarships and tuition reimbursement. This staffing campaign builds on other actions by HHS and the Department of Labor to build the nursing workforce.\n\n“Wages are an important part of job quality and drive challenges in recruitment and retention of direct care workers. Our research shows that in many places these workers can earn higher wages doing other entry-level work,” said Miranda Lynch-Smith, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nMore than 500,000 direct care workers provide care in nursing homes, assisting residents with daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, and eating. This work, performed primarily by women of color, is significantly undervalued. Direct care workers across long-term care settings earn low wages, rarely receive health and retirement benefits, and experience high injury rates. Improving working conditions and wages will lead to improvements in the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and enable nursing staff to provide safer care.\n\nFindings published by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation show that wages for direct care workers trail other entry-level jobs. In 2019, median wages for nursing assistants were lower than the wages of other entry level jobs in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As an example, the median wage for nursing assistants in Louisiana is $10.90 per hour, compared to $13.41 for other entry-level positions. This is despite the significant demands of direct care jobs and their essential role in meeting the long-term care needs of older adults and people with disabilities.\n\nOther announcements from CMS and the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made today would increase transparency, enhance enforcement of existing standards, increase accountability, and ensure safe, high-quality, and dignified care for people living in nursing homes. These announcements include:\n\nIncreasing Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nImproving Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm.

This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also prevent a transparent and accurate assessment of whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nCracking Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

This longitudinal study considered a comparative evaluation of COVID-19 containment ...', 'Full_text': 'The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic unleashed extraordinary challenges on humanity. Governments implemented various policies aimed at containing the spread of infection and stabilizing their economies. Many institutions—including the Economist Intelligence Unit1, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)2, NLI Research Institute3, and Bloomberg4—have assessed global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation criteria differ across these institutions (Supplementary Information 1–3), and their studies have had different focuses and produced varying evaluation results.\n\nHere, we introduce a set of criteria for assessing virus-containment effectiveness, where the aim of containment is to minimize harm to societies and economies. The proposed criteria include several previously examined indicators, namely monthly cases per 100,000 members of a population (per capita), fatality rate, and GDP loss. Additionally, because OxCGRT\'s stringency index (SI)2 cannot reflect rigor accurately based on monthly case numbers (Supplementary Information 4), we propose a lockdown efficiency (LE) parameter, which relates stringency to incidence5 (Supplementary Information 5). We include the following five OxCGRT indicators of health-system policies2: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, and (from December 2020 onward) vaccination policy.\n\nTo track long-term impacts on health literacy and mental health, we collated data from Google searches for “wash hands”, “face mask”, and “insomnia” as surrogates for national population health literacy and mental health. Surveys on COVID-19–related mental health and health literacy are mostly based on self-reported, cross-sectional studies and rarely multinational6. However, population health literacy and mental health trends have been shown to be reflected in search volume trends7,8. The search engine analysis website Google Trends has been used for population mental-health surveillance as well as for long-term tracking of depression9 and suicide10.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines cast new hope for curbing the pandemic. Until August 19, 2021, the World Health Organization had issued only emergency-use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines11. By September 12, 2021, 42% of the worldwide population had received at least one dose of a vaccine12. Therefore, we incorporate vaccine-related indicators into our research.\n\nWe propose a set of ten indices, including four government policy and hygiene education (GP&HE) indicators and six vital health and socioeconomic (VH&SE) measures. Our research is divided into pre- and post-vaccine availability phases. For the first phase (March 2020 to November 2020), we focus on evaluating the appropriateness of the LE indicator, which we developed using linear mixed models to determine how each GP&HE indicator correlates with each VH&SE measure. In the second phase during which there was ongoing vaccine distribution (December 2020 to November 2021), we added vaccine-related indicators to enable more comprehensive containment performance analyses. We compared indicator scores for 50 distinctly governed territories.\n\nOur scoring system, modified from previous studies2,3, includes GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures. The GP&HE indicators include: LE; health-system policies; health literacy indicators; and vaccine coverage of the population (December 2020 onward). The VH&SE measures include: one-month cases per capita; infection growth rate; fatality rate; GDP loss due to the pandemic; unemployment rate; and psychological impact (Table 1)2,5,13,14,15.\n\nGP&HE indicators\n\nGovernment response is associated with COVID-19 incidence2. Our newly introduced indicator LE is calculated based on COVID-19 incidence data and the SI2, a factor that does not account for COVID-19 incidence. LE has a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4 and 5).\n\nWe developed another indicator called health-system policies, which is a simple average of the four OxCGRT indicators: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, and facial coverings2. Each of these indicators is derived from daily data, and thus could potentially be represented with monthly means or modes. We used monthly modes as the representative score for each month. From December 2020 onward, we added OxCGRT vaccination policy2 to the calculation of the health-system policies indicator.\n\nHealth literacy is beneficial to reducing the spread of infectious diseases7. Therefore, Google Trends were used to obtain search trends for “wash hands” and “face mask”, which act as surrogate indicators of health literacy7 (Supplementary Information 6).\n\nFor the second phase of the research (December 2020–November 2021), we added the aforementioned indicator people covered by vaccines15 by modifying the calculation of health-system policies to include vaccination policy. This indicator was calculated as the ratio of the number of vaccine doses administered to the number of doses required for full vaccination. For simplicity, we assumed that every individual in each country needs only two doses of vaccine.\n\nVH&SE measures\n\nNLI Research Institute definitions of one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and fatality rate were adopted3. Unemployment rate and GDP loss were defined relative to the same timeframe in 2020–2021 and 2019–2020 (Table 1). We quantified change in searches for “insomnia” to indicate the extent of the pandemic’s impact on a population’s mental health. Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-198,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack17,18, depression8, or suicide8.\n\nCorrelation analyses\n\nIn phase one, linear mixed models were used to explore the relationship between each GP&HE indicator and VH&SE measure. Because these values vary over time and may affect each other, we conducted two-stage analyses (Supplementary Information 4). We tested LE and SI legitimacy2. In phase two, we calculated Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficients to determine whether the indicator “people covered by vaccines” correlates with three vital health indicators, namely one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and one-month case fatality rate.\n\nScoring of GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures\n\nWe ranked the performance of 50 countries and territories according to total indicator scores (Supplementary Information 7 and 8), where a higher score implies better containment performance. We graphed the score distribution (Supplementary Figs. S11-S31) to visualize the relationship between pre-pandemic baseline risk levels and monthly containment scores. We assigned all 50 countries and territories to low, medium, or high baseline risk categories and calculated monthly average containment scores for each risk level (Supplementary Information 9).\n\nGeographic comparison\n\nWe calculated monthly average containment scores for six geographic group and conducted two-sample t-tests and Mann–Whitney U-tests to compare containment performance between Latin American and non-Latin American countries and between Asian and non-Asian countries prior to vaccine introduction (Supplementary Information 10 and 11). Additionally, we compared mean containment performance scores before versus after inclusion of vaccine indicators (Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted via SAS software (version 9.4); P values were two-tailed with 0.05 significance level.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our study results in relation to uncertainties in the indicator calculation methods and the inclusion/exclusion of Google Trends indicators. Nine scenarios were evaluated (e.g. daily score means vs. modes; see Supplementary Table S35). The results obtained with different methods of calculating indices are given in Supplementary Tables S36–S40. Revised calculations with the inclusion of Google Trends are reported in Supplementary Tables S41–S44. The results obtained with the main scenarios (as defined in Table 1) are shown in Supplementary Tables S45 and S46, with the former including Google Trends indicators and the latter excluding Google Trends indicators. For the sensitivity analysis, we compared: (1) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S40 to the results in Supplementary Table S46; (2) data in each of Supplementary Tables S41–S44 to the results in Supplementary Table S45; and (3) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S39 to data in respective Supplementary Tables S41–S44 (i.e., Supplementary Table S41 vs. Supplementary Table S36, Supplementary Table S42 vs. Supplementary Table S37; Supplementary Table S43 vs. Supplementary Table S38; Supplementary Table S44 vs. Supplementary Table S39).\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe institutional review board of the National Health Research Institutes approved this study (EC1091110-E-R1).\n\nComparison between LE and SI prior to vaccine availability\n\nTwo-stage linear mixed models revealed no reasonable relationship between OxCGRT’s SI and one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4). For each unit increase in the SI in July 2020, the estimated one-month cases per capita in August 2020 increased by 7.83 people (P = 0.03; Supplementary Table S2). Similar trends are observable for other months, contradicting the expectation that an increase in government policies in month s should reduce case numbers in month s + 1.\n\nFor every unit of increase in LE (defined in Table 1) in month s, the estimated one-month cases per capita in month s + 1 decreases. For each unit of increase in LE in September and October 2020, one-month cases per capita in October and November 2020 decrease by 629.55 and 597.94 people, respectively (both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S3). Although the relationships between LE and one-month cases per capita are not statistically significant in other months, we observe a consistent downward trend in cases subsequent to lockdowns.\n\nFrom our analyses, we deduce that our LE indicator is legitimate, and that the SI does not have a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita. Therefore, we use LE as an indicator in our subsequent evaluation.\n\nTwo stage-linear mixed models also show that the health-system policy in month s does impact fatality in month s + 1 within some periods of time. For every unit of increase in health-system policies in April and May 2020, fatality rates in May and June 2020 decrease by 7.84% and 3.86%, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).\n\nCOVID-19 containment effectiveness\n\nPerformance scores for citizens’ health literacy and insomnia (Google Trends data) for six territories over the 21-month study period are shown in Fig. 1. All monthly COVID-19 containment rankings and scores from March 2020 to November 2021 are shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 and in Supplementary Tables S13–S33 (Supplementary Information 8 and 12). The best performing countries and territories in 2020 are located mainly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and New Zealand.\n\nBaseline risk\n\nLow- and middle-baseline-risk territories are concentrated in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan, whereas high-baseline-risk nations are located mostly in Europe, including France and the UK. Countries in the Americas span the three risk levels (Fig. 3a). In the first phase, most low- and middle-baseline-risk countries and territories achieved better containment than their high-risk counterparts. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Finland, were able to restrain COVID-19 transmission despite having high baseline risk levels (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information 9 and Supplementary Fig. S32a).\n\nGeographical comparison prior to vaccine allocation\n\nPrior to vaccine distribution, Latin America was severely impacted by the pandemic, while Oceania and Asia had good containment (Fig. 4a). Non-Latin American nations achieved better overall containment performance than their Latin American counterparts, which were severely affected. From April 2020 to September 2020, performance differed between these two groups, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.027; Supplementary Information 10).\n\nAsian governments outperformed their non-Asian counterparts in phase one (Supplementary Information 11). From March to November 2020, with the exception of July 2020, performance scores of Asian countries were higher than those of non-Asian countries, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.039).\n\nAsian countries performed dramatically better than non-Asian countries in LE and health-system policies early in the pandemic (April 2020 LE scores P = 0.007; March/April 2020 health-system policy scores P < 0.003). These results suggest that Asian governments enacted effective policies early (Supplementary Information 11).\n\nScoring system robustness\n\nSensitivity analyses revealed that (1) changing indicator calculation methods and (2) adding Google Trends indicators altered overall rankings slightly (Supplementary Information 13).\n\nPerformance after vaccine distribution\n\nThe best performers in 2020 were mostly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and New Zealand. After vaccine indicators are included, the containment performance scores of these countries decrease. Inclusion of vaccine indicators from December 2020 onward results in higher containment performance scores in Singapore, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina (Figs. 2, 3b,c and 4). Among the six geographic regions analyzed, North American countries have the highest vaccine coverage. Their containment performance improves rapidly when vaccine indicators are included. Similar improvements are observed in Europe and Latin America (Fig. 4). Most high-baseline risk countries benefit from their high vaccination coverage (Supplementary Fig. S32).\n\nVaccination coverage\n\nIn the first 6 months of vaccine distribution, one-month cases per capita in month t correlates positively with vaccine coverage in month t and subsequent months. With the exception of the relationship between one-month cases per capita in May 2021 and people covered by vaccines in August 2021, all remaining months correlated (P < 0.0246). In the first 3 months after vaccine distribution ensued (December 2020–February 2021), people covered by vaccines in month t correlated negatively with infection growth rate in the subsequent t + 3, t + 4, or t + 5 months (P < 0.0461). Starting in March 2021, people covered by vaccines correlates negatively with infection growth rate in respective subsequent months, though the relationship does not reach statistical significance for all months. A delayed negative correlation of people covered by vaccines with fatality rate can be seen. Starting from June 2021, the number of people vaccinated in month t correlated negatively with fatality rate in month t and subsequent months (P < 0.0394) (Supplementary Tables S47–S49).\n\nTo evaluate COVID-19 containment performance impartially, we developed and tested a comprehensive evaluation method that accounts for GP&HE indicators, VH&SE measures, and vaccination. LE captures a nation’s effectiveness in enacting measures according to recent incidence. As variants continue to emerge, a new normal, in which pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are considered should be established. Because it is unreasonable to expect life to normalize completely in the short term, we did not include the global normalcy index19 in our analyses.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of the Google Trends indicator altered the overall rankings of the 50 examined countries and territories slightly. We included it for three reasons: Google Trends data reflect health literacy and impacts on mental health7,8; none of the global institutions assessing COVID-19 containment effectiveness have included public responses in their evaluation criteria; and we believe that public response is important for transmission control.\n\nPrior to vaccine allocation, some countries and territories in Asia and Oceania were more successful at suppressing COVID-19 outbreaks than their European and American counterparts. They exhibited a relative weakening of containment performance after inclusion of the vaccine indicator (since December 2020), likely due, at least in part, to their lower vaccination coverage (Supplementary Information 12, Fig. 4).\n\nNew Zealand and Singapore emerged as the most stable performers. New Zealand has been steadfast in its fight against the vexatious COVID-19, increasing its LE to overcome spikes in infection (March/April 2020) and in fatality (May 2020). Successful containment has contributed to their economic stability during the first phase of pandemic (Supplementary Information 12). After New Zealand was invaded by the Delta variant in August 202120, the number of confirmed cases and infection rates increased, and New Zealand responded with an accelerated vaccination strategy (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nAlthough Singapore did not control rapid viral spread initially, they recovered from outbreaks well. Following a 5-month period of rising cases (April–August 2020), the Singapore government improved its health-system policies and LE, leading to decreased case numbers thereafter. Since January 2021, Singapore has been administering vaccines efficiently, making it a model nation for curbing COVID-19 (Supplementary Information 12). However, the surge in coronavirus infections and confirmed cases in Singapore since September 2021 may be related to Singapore’s “coexisting with COVID-19” strategy and the Delta variant outbreak21,22. Whether Singapore can achieve the goal of ""live with the virus"" has become the focus of global attention.\n\nChanges in containment performance scores of six locations associated with notable performance, activities, or policies are shown in Fig. 1. Denmark and the UK have high vaccination coverage23. Denmark lifted restrictions on September 10, 202124. Starting on July 19, 2021, the UK lifted most of its restrictions and removed social distancing recommendations25. In all US regions, restrictions have eased and people have returned to generally normal life26. The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8 and from August 24 to September 5 of 2021, respectively27. Vietnam was Asia\'s top-performing economy in 202028. Taiwan has been praised for its 253-day streak without local infections29.\n\nDenmark\'s infection growth increased rapidly from September 2020 to January 2021, though their fatality rate remained low. Transmission was mitigated through strict health-system policies, improved LE, and mass vaccinations. Although the number of confirmed cases increased after May 2021, the fatality rate was low. The pandemic within Denmark appeared to be under stable control, but at the end of the study Denmark faced another new wave of outbreaks, the development of which remains to be seen (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nContainment performance in the UK was not satisfactory in phase one. The UK improved LE and health-system policies while administering vaccinations on a massive scale. These efforts enabled a gradual containment of COVID-19 transmission, which was suppressed by March 2021. There was a case/infection growth surge in June 2021 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nThe USA did not control infection well in the first phase, but its containment performance improved in the second phase. They have endured large numbers of confirmed cases with cascading regional surges (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nJapan adopted inclusive health-system policies. Although their confirmed cases increased during the 2021 Olympics, Japan had several prior waves of increased case numbers, including two in 2021 (January and May). Whether the increase in confirmed cases during the Olympics can be attributed to Olympic event gatherings remains to be clarified (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nVietnam performed well in early but experienced a short-term containment performance decline in August 2020. Vietnam controlled an outbreak that emerged in February 2021 successfully. Infection growth in Vietnam has been relatively high since May 2021, and was only slightly contained until October, but then increased again in November. Transmission in late summer 2021 may reflect Delta variant invasion under low vaccination coverage (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nTaiwan is an exemplary case. COVID-19 transmission was suppressed early owing to a rapid response by Taiwan\'s Central Epidemic Command Center with cooperation from local government agencies and the public30. Taiwan suffered a case surge under low vaccine coverage in May and June 2021. The Central Epidemic Command Center responded with intensive data gathering, expansive testing, quarantines, and stringent non-pharmaceutical policies31. Faced with the highly transmissible Delta variant, Taiwan suppressed case numbers within 2 ~ 3 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nWhile countries seek to increase vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness has been tested by the Delta variant and breakthrough infections. In addition to vaccination, non-pharmacological interventions, such as handwashing, masking, and physical distancing, remain important for preventing transmission.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nOur research suggests that the top performing nations tend to enact rigorous health system policies and locally-appropriate lockdown measures, especially early in the pandemic (Supplementary Information 12, and Supplementary Table S11). Asian countries’ border control policies were implemented earlier than non-Asian countries. In Asian and non-Asian countries, the median times to any border closure from the first reported case in China were 24.50 and 67.50 days, respectively (P = 0.0003), and the median times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -10.50 and 8.00 days, respectively (P = 0.0027) (Supplementary Table S50, Supplementary Information 15). Notwithstanding, stringent lockdown measures should not be enacted without careful consideration, and lockdown policies should be adjusted in response to recent incidence. Flexibility in their implementation can yield containment with minimal harm to societies, economies, and mental health.\n\nLimitations\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted. First, we include unemployment rate and GDP loss, but not international aid, economic stimulus packages, or other fiscal measures. Second, Google Trends data do not represent a random sampling and may exclude vulnerable groups without internet access or those not actively searching. Third, ideally, only local infection rates should be considered to obtain precise LE measurements. However, because daily local case data are not fully available, we used incidence data inclusive of imported cases to determine LE scores. Therefore, minor inaccuracies in our LE data are expected (Supplementary Information 5).'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14088-7', 'Headline': 'A cross-country comparison of Covid-19 containment measures and their ...', 'Snippet': 'Background European countries are still searching to eliminate or contain the Covid-19 pandemic. A variety of approaches have achieved different levels of success in limiting the spread of the disease early and preventing avoidable deaths. Governmental policy responses may explain these differences and this study aims to describe evidence about the effectiveness of containment measures ...', 'Full_text': 'Although the availability of vaccines to fight against SARS-CoV-2, various countries are still facing numerous barriers, some of them in paradox, such as vaccine hesitancy [1]. In fact, the progress of modern medicine has allowed the development in record time of effective and safe vaccines to prevent Covid-19 symptomatic infection, severe disease, admissions to hospital, and deaths [2,3,4]. Unfortunately, it has not been possible yet to ensure equitable access to vaccination throughout the world because there is not adequate availability of vaccines. Thus, it is essential to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission and reduce infections (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines). Actually, around the world, countries are still seeking to limit the impact of Covid-19 on health and society after more than 2 years of fighting SARS-CoV-2. To do this, governments are working as fast and fairly as possible to avoid new waves of the pandemic, minimize lives lost and maximize health, economic and social outcomes. Now, in 2022, we are more capable to identify new outbreaks early through timely and constant monitoring, to take appropriate measures to control the spreading of the virus (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/governments-approach-to-managing-local-coronavirus-outbreaks). We have a tool to control the virus, but large parts of the population for various reasons refuse to accept it. Countries have put in place legislative plans to address this issue. The concept, previously unknown, of a Covid Certificate has been introduced, in its various denominations and with the various peculiarities in different nations or geographical areas, showing also in this field differences at the international level [5].\n\nDespite the availability of a winning tool - vaccines - due to the problems mentioned above, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain essential. They must be combined with a very accurate contact tracing and mass vaccination campaigns to be extended to as many countries as possible.\n\nThrough our research, we seek to understand how different mitigation and containment strategies have been important in the past, focusing specifically on the investigation of the early stages of the pandemic, so that we can emphasize how key they are today and for the future at minimizing the risk of potential additional waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [6] in containing and mitigating contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus was assessed in this study [7]. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the containment measures adopted in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nNon-pharmaceutical public health measures and their effects on person-to-person transmission at the individual level (physical distancing, use of face masks, wearing of eye protection) have been studied by the Covid-19 Systematic Urgent Review Group Effort (SURGE). The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of one meter or more and highlight the importance of the use of masks, respirators and eye protection in order to avoid or minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants [8].\n\nStay-at-home orders, curfews and lockdown measures commonly occurred in countries with more than 10% daily increases in new cases [9] and the enforcement of strict physical distancing, along with robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, contributed to keeping the disease at a level that did not exceed the capacity of a country’s health care system [10].\n\nHowever, policy responses to Covid-19 seem to remain complex, context-specific and are rapidly evolving as different countries pursue varying approaches to manage the pandemic. Analyzing these policies can help to understand and assess government preparedness, timing of reactions and resilience (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), [11].\n\nConsiderable efforts have gone into tracking health systems’ or governments’ responses to the pandemic, e.g., as part of the Covid-19 Health Systems Response Monitor. For example, Li et al. and Flaxman et al. conducted interesting comparisons of the approaches adopted by different countries in dealing with the pandemic [12]. In addition, previous research has shown that countries with less stringent lockdown measures have seen more pronounced surges (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).\n\nThis research aims to describe evidence on the effect of containment measures throughout the course of the pandemic in five European countries so far. “Containment measures” refer to the non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions. More specifically, the paper’s objectives included: 1) to compare the strength of containment measures adopted in the included countries; 2) to assess the timing of the introduction and relaxation of containment measures in relationship to the changes in the number of cases in these countries; and 3) to speculate about the effect the timing of relaxation measures had on the future course of the pandemic.\n\nWe chose France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom for our analysis because they were the first European countries to be hit by the pandemic (by end of February 2020, according to John Hopkins University information (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The results of this study may help decision makers better understand the effects of containment measures and the potential implications of lifting these measures too early. In fact, after studying the examples provided by the five countries and making statistical forecasts, we intend to provide a model that can help policy makers in making their important choices to address the current new waves of the pandemic and variants of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe approach adopted by this study consisted of three steps. First, we built a “Containment Index” (C.I.) which considers nine parameters selected in order to make assessments on the strength of restrictive measures adopted by the five included countries. Second, dynamic epidemiological models were developed for forecasting purposes. Third, predicted case numbers, assuming containment measures remain constant, were compared to observed numbers for a period of 30 days following the relaxation of containment measures in each country.\n\nMeasuring intervention with the containment index\n\nIn order to measure government reactions to the pandemic, we followed a similar approach as the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [13], but focused on containment measures only and tailored it to the countries in scope for our analysis (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK).\n\nWe identified a set of nine parameters C1, C2 ...C9 (only partially overlapping with OxCGRT), as described in Table 1, then scored and summarized them into a single summary index called “Containment Index” (C.I.).\n\nWeb research was conducted to collect the following information on governments’ responses in the five selected European countries: details of the actions they took, the start and end dates of those actions. Various bibliographic sources and reference sites were consulted for all countries analyzed in the study (https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-which-countries-are-under-lockdown-and-who-s-next), (https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse) to collect information on the restrictive measures respectively adopted in France (https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19), (https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-deconfinement-May-11-What-is-allowed-or-not-allowed-parks-beaches-schools-bars-restaurants-going-out-travel-transport), (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11391728/coronavirus-france-lockdown/), (https://www.france24.com/en/20200622-back-to-school-for-millions-in-france-as-more-covid-19-restrictions-lifted), (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/26/scho-m26.html), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52615733), Germany (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en), (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51999080), (https://kcrwberlin.com/2020/06/covid-19-in-berlin-and-germany-what-you-need-to-know/), (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany), (https://berlinspectator.com/2020/06/01/chronology-germany-and-the-coronavirus-3/), (https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/germany-extends-covid19-restrictions-but-announces-relaxation-of-some-measures/), (https://www.bavaria.by/information-coronavirus/), (https://www.thelocal.de/20200518/state-by-state-what-are-the-new-rules-for-eating-out-around-germany), (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/germans-urged-to-stay-home-amid-covid-19-infection-rate-fears), (https://www.dw.com/en/what-are-germanys-new-coronavirus-social-distancing-rules/a-52881742), Italy (http://www.governo.it/it/coronavirus-misure-del-governo), Spain (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2) and in the UK (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), (supplementary material S0).\n\nFor each parameter, responses have been scored according to the below schema (Table 2). Scores are scaled to the same range from 0 (no restrictions) to 1 (max containment) in order to make them comparable. For some measures it was not possible to define an intermediate grading and we described it in the table as ‘not assigned’.\n\nWe tracked the start and end dates for each progressive restriction and then, for the data analyses and representation, the temporal axis was converted from days to weeks (Mon. - Sun.), following the rule that, for a given parameter, a week is assigned the score that is valid for the most (≥ 4) days in the week. In our analyses we tracked and analyzed data from the week starting on February 24th, 2020, to the week starting June 1st, 2020.\n\nFinally, for each country/week, an overall Containment Index (C.I.) score was assigned. This is defined as the sum of the scores for the nine metrics, reflecting our assumption that each parameter evenly contributes to the overall index.\n\nModeling Covid-19 infection\n\nWe developed a Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator which allows for daily predictions of “total active cases” based on the level and trajectory of active cases by country, region or state (public data from national and regional health commissions for the five countries analyzed: France [14, 15], Germany [16], Italy (https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19), Spain [17, 18] and the UK [19, 20], (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=nations&map=rate).\n\nThe Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator fits an upgraded version of the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) compartmental models to allow for parameter customization by country, region or state and introduces dynamic contact rates to better predict the peak time and general trend. SEIR [21,22,23,24,25,26] is a well-known class of models that is widely used for modeling epidemic evolution and generating related predictions. The SEIR model, its general parameters and the other parameters introduced to adjust the model to better fit different nations or regions are explained in detail in in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S1).\n\nThe input to the models were confirmed Covid-19 cases (per PCR testing) that have been progressively made available by national/regional health commissions [10, 27], (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-).\n\nIn some cases, public data have been amended and/or integrated after. This is not reflected in our analyses. In case of missing reported total cases for a few specific days, linear interpolation was applied.\n\nComparing the containment index across countries\n\nGiven the lack of an internationally accepted definition of terms, such as “lockdown” or “Phase Two”, we decided to define key milestones (and consequently phases) based on the evolution of the Containment Index over time to facilitate comparability across countries:\n\nTargeted period starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 0 and if the first government measures are targeted to specific areas, regions or subsets of the population (called T0).\n\nLockdown starts when the Containment Index becomes greater than 7 (the countries during lockdown can reach the maximum value of Containment Index, which is 9) (called T1).\n\nPhase Two starts when, after the peak, the Containment Index becomes lower again or equal to 6 (called T2).\n\nSubsequently, analyses focused on comparing countries on a like-for-like basis, somewhat ignoring calendar time. Comparisons have been carried out in terms of descriptive analyses of the collected information (total cases and containment measures) as well as leveraging the predictions generated by the SEIR models implemented.\n\nFor each country, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator has provided daily forecasts for total cases up to a maximum of + 150 days. For example, on March 1st, the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator generated predictions for total cases for March 2nd (+ 1 day) up to July 28th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 1st; on March 2nd it generated predictions for March 3rd (+ 1 day) up to July 29th (+ 150 days) leveraging observed total cases up to March 2nd and so on. Day-after-day models progressively learn by incremental information made available which is reflected in more accurate predictions.\n\nIn the initial phase of the pandemic, one of the interesting objectives was to predict time to peak. But, as time passed, forecasts generated in previous months had been progressively overridden by actual data. Now, looking backward, we can leverage predictions made at specific points in time, compare different trajectories and correlate them to the different underlying restriction policies. In particular, based on predictions taken at Phase Two’s start (T2), we might speculate on what, under modelling assumptions, might have happened if lockdown restrictions continued for a longer time.\n\nFor such an exercise, we decided to focus on predictions at + 30 days. On one hand, we know that the accuracy of long-term predictions rapidly decreases given the extremely complex, fast-evolving factors that affect pandemic evolution (government restrictions as well as population compliance, mobility, individual behavior, social organization, climate, etc.). On the other hand, it is important to consider that potential effects of a containment measure might need approximately 14 days, according to the average duration for incubation based on clinical evidence and the recent studies confirming there is a lag for impacts of measures to be visible [28]. So, we need a forecast window reasonably greater than 2 weeks. Balancing the two considerations we chose a maximum timeframe of + 30 days.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK applied restrictive measures to contain the pandemic, but the timing and effect on the national curves of the Covid-19 cases varied. The graphical representation of these results is available in supplementary materials (Supplementary material S2).\n\nInitial reactions\n\nItaly was the first western country to face the pandemic; the country had to react quickly and did not give up. During the week beginning on February 24th, some restrictive measures were applied only at a local level with a Containment Index of 4.5 (all confined locally to the so-called “red areas”). One week later, these measures were intensified and some of them were extended to the national level, while other restrictions were only adopted locally.\n\nIn Germany, the period of restricted measures that were partially applied at the regional level lasted for 4 weeks, twice as long as in Italy. It began, as in Italy, on February 24th, but in a very mild way, through the partial closure of schools and moreover only at a local level (C.I. = 0.25).\n\nIn Spain, the targeted local measures lasted only 1 week, starting on March 9th and concerned the partial local closure of some schools (C1 = 0.5).\n\nIn France, targeted restrictive measures were applied only on the first parameter: partial and local closure of schools from March 2nd to March 15th (C1 = 0.5).\n\nThe United Kingdom has having a particular attitude in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially, they decided not to adopt any restrictive measures and recently as early as January 27, 2022 have lifted the requirement for masks and green passes. “In England, face coverings are no longer required by law. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet” (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own).\n\nCountry lockdowns\n\nOn March 9th, Italy was the first European country to enter a national lockdown and it lasted for 10 weeks, until May 3rd, with a C.I. = 9 and for the next 2 weeks until May 17th with a C.I. = 6.75.\n\nFrom March 16th to May 10th, France was in lockdown for 8 weeks (C.I. = 9).\n\nOn March 16th, also Spain entered lockdown for 9 weeks. We observed C.I. = 9 only for 3 weeks (from March 30th to April 19th), after which it progressively decreased. Starting on May 11th, the last week of lockdown, closures were regional for all the analyzed parameters, leading to an overall C.I. = 7.\n\nIn Germany, during the lockdown that started on March 23rd, the value of the C.I. varied from 7.25 in the first 4 weeks to 6.75 in the two remaining weeks of the entire period (6 weeks).\n\nOn the same day as Germany, the UK government decided to enter a national lockdown that lasted 10 weeks (one of the longest lockdowns among the countries analyzed). During the first 7 weeks, C.I. = 9 and then, from May 11th to May 31st, C.I. = 7.75\n\nEntering phase two\n\nThe first country to enter the Phase Two was Germany: beginning on May 4th, shops with less than 800 square meters and limited in-person shops could re-open, but with restrictions. From May 4th to May 18th, the C.I. was equal to 3.5. nationally then C.I. decreased to 3.25 on May 25th.\n\nAfter entering Phase Two on May 11th, France maintained an overall C.I. = 5 for the remaining duration of the analyzed period. It was possible to move within a maximum distance of 100 km and schools gradually reopened at the beginning of Phase Two but with some restrictions: e.g., middle schools remained closed in red zones and gradually reopened in departments only in green zones.\n\nOn May 18th, Phase Two began in Italy at the national level: the C.I. achieved during the first 2 weeks of this phase was 3.25 (schools continue to be closed and there was no longer the stay-at-home requirement). During the week beginning on June 1st, the C.I. lowered to 2.5 due to no more restrictions on domestic movement.\n\nOn the same day as in Italy, Spain entered Phase Two and the restrictive measures were relaxed at the regional level with a C.I. = 5.25. From May 25th to the end of our analysis period, Spain achieved a C.I. = 4.\n\nOn June 1st in the UK, there was a gradual relaxation of the restrictive measures and the country entered Phase Two, but the level of attention and alertness was kept high, as reflected by a C.I. = 6, with a partial opening of schools and restrictions on gatherings\n\nPredictions about lockdown end and phase two start: (T2) + 30 days\n\nThe predictions made with our forecasting model focused especially on Lockdown end and Phase Two start. T2 + 30 would have been June 3rd in Germany, June 10th in France, June 17th in Italy and Spain and July 1stin the UK.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we analyzed the total number of reported positive cases per 100,000 of population in the five countries (https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker), (https://www.spainenglish.com/2020/05/31/lifting-lockdown-spain-full-details-phases/), (https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200605/mapa-desescalada-espana-fase-esta-tu-provincia/2013477.shtml), (https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/codigos/codigo.php?id=363&modo=2&nota=0&tab=2), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy), (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-and-devolution), (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools), [14,15,16, 27].\n\nConsidering the duration of the restrictive measures in the lockdown phase of the pandemic, Germany adopted the longest local (targeted) restrictive measures (4 weeks) and the shortest lockdown (6 weeks), which started later (when there were 35 cases per 100 K) compared to the other countries. Almost all the selected countries adopted restrictive measures for a period of 10 weeks while in Italy they took a period of 12 weeks (10 of which as lockdown). All the selected countries implemented a gradual closure of services and a progressive limitation of individual freedom except for the UK, since they didn’t adopt targeted measures.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we plotted the actual cases curve (continuous line) against predictions taken at T2 (dotted line) for each country (i.e., assuming lockdown containment measures were not eased). For instance, in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, predictions under the assumption of additional lockdown weeks would have led to significantly lower cases (− 4.9, − 3.3%, − 2.4%, and − 5.9%, respectively at T2 + 30 days). However, for Italy, the real cases curve is very close to the predicted cases (+ 0.5% at T2 + 30 days), indicating that, had they maintained restrictions, they would not have changed the evolution on the curve.\n\nIn addition, in Fig. 4 we have compared actual against predictions taken at T2 focusing on average new daily cases in the following 30 days. Here we can see that, according to predictions from our model, all countries except Italy might have benefited from a prolonged lockdown.\n\nTo face the Covid-19 pandemic, most European countries, and in particular those analyzed in this study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), have adopted diverse non-pharmaceutical and restrictive interventions ranging from case quarantine and isolation of contacts to the lockdown of entire populations. Assessing the impact of lockdowns and identifying the optimal strategies to manage the health crisis beyond lockdowns is of critical importance. To avoid the healthcare facilities overload, the severity of clinical cases and many deaths, it is has proved necessary to plan the response, adopting measures such as case finding, contact tracing, isolations and lockdowns of nations [29] and in parallel the large-scale vaccination campaign. Although these restrictive measures are crucial in minimizing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, the risk of pandemic resurgence when restrictions are relaxed and societies go back to a “business as usual” lifestyle has remained high. It is important to find a compromise between public health requirement and the economic and social needs of the population, analyzing the different restrictive measures in order to improve these measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [10].\n\nThe Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) constantly collects information on measures taken by different governments to contain the effects of the pandemic and now has data from more than 180 countries. Surely this is an important tool for worldwide comparisons but, in our study, we thought it would be helpful to understand these comparisons across a limited number of European countries. As a result, we went for a tailored definition of all parameters for Containment Index definition.\n\nOther studies have addressed the topic of quantifying the effect of containment actions by looking at a rather high number of countries: Talic S et al. performed a meta-analysis to research the effect of handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing measures on incidence of Covid-19. They concluded that these several personal and social protective measures are associated with decrease in virus circulation [30].\n\nIezadi S et al. in their meta-analysis showed that NPIs has determined a decrease in the COVID-19 reproduction number, daily case growth rates, daily death growth rates and COVID-19 daily ICU admission. It emerged that early enaction of lockdown, which predates the explosion in the number of positive cases, has been followed by a shorter duration of the lockdown itself and a smaller increase in the rate of case growth in the period after the application of this maximum containment measure [31].\n\nLi et al. conducted a modelling study across 131 countries [28] and Flaxman et al. studied the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries [12]. Conversely, our analyses aimed to describe, in a comparative way, different containment approaches implemented by the five countries and to qualitatively correlate them with the evolution of the pandemic. Our analyses were aimed at assessing whether mild measures or delays in adopting the different types of restrictive measures could have influenced the number of Covid-19 cases and the evolution of the epidemic curve, in order to be able to guide the near-future choices of governments, policy makers and health authorities in the best possible way. Consequently, based on the evolution of case numbers and the adopted restrictive measures in Europe, it is possible to make the following considerations.\n\nFollowing the diagnosis of the first patient affected by Covid-19 in Germany on January 27th, Germany implemented much milder and shorter restrictive measures in comparison to the other four countries. All restrictions were applied to every German state and were kept in place for a total of 6 weeks but there was never a total closure and, unlike the other European countries, Germany never issued a curfew. It should be noted that during the lockdown Germany never adopted the stay-at-home requirements in an absolute way (C8 = 0.5). Germany would have had a reduction of new cases from an extension of the lockdown and likely from the application of more restrictive measures as well, given the trend of the T2 + 30 curve in our predictive model (− 3.3%).\n\nAs early as January 30th, the Italian government ordered the blocking of air traffic from China, the first European government to do so. This was the beginning of the application of a long list of restrictive measures in Italy. After the first 2 weeks of targeted measures, Italy adopted one of the longest periods of lockdown (10 weeks, like in the UK) compared to the other selected countries. The adoption of such stringent measures has made a unique and indispensable contribution to the ongoing fight against the pandemic. In fact, as we observed in our predictive model, it seems that the relaxation of the restrictive measures was introduced at the right time because there would have been no net reduction of daily cases if the country would have entered Phase Two later (T2 + 30 = 0,5%). This shows a big difference between Italy and the other four countries analyzed in our study regarding the entry of the countries to Phase Two.\n\nAs France experienced the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown was implemented to curb the dramatic increase in the number of patients in critical conditions. The country is the only one to have maintained a total closure for all parameters (C.I. = 9) during the entire lockdown. However, this seems not to have been enough. In fact, considering our predictive model, France could have benefited from an extension of the lockdown duration, being able to obtain a further reduction in the number of new cases (T2 + 30 = − 4,9%).\n\nFollowing the story of Italy, Germany and France, Spain adopted a long lockdown (9 weeks) but maintained the maximum level of restriction for the shortest time (the maximum C.I. = 9 was true for only 3 weeks, compared to Germany where the maximum C.I. = 7.25 was held for 4 weeks). Spain is also the only country to have applied all restrictive measures at the targeted level before Phase Two (i.e., during the lockdown). Both these attitudes could justify the trend of the T2 + 30 curve of our preventive model (− 2,4%). The country probably should have applied more stringent restrictive measures and should have delayed the application of restrictive measures at the regional level, considering that Spain is the country that entered Phase Two with the highest number of cases per 100 K population (496 total cases per 100 K population) among the five countries analyzed.\n\nThe UK, despite not having gone through a targeted period, has applied very stringent restrictive measures during the lockdown and the country has very gradually entered Phase Two. The UK lockdown lasted for the same duration as the Italian lockdown, but the country started to adopt the first restrictive measures 4 weeks later than Italy did (March 23rd in the UK compared to February 24th in Italy). In our preventive model, the country would have benefited greatly (− 5.9%) from a delayed entry into Phase Two. This can be justified, as in France, by a consistent circulation of the virus that was difficult to control, already existing at the beginning of the adoption of the restrictive measures in the country. The UK has decided not to take some measures on a regional basis, as has been done by France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe easing of the measures was carried out in a more or less gradual and cautious way by all five countries: for Phase Two, Germany had reported the lowest number of total cases per 100 K population among the five countries of the study, followed by France, Italy, the UK, and finally Spain (which loosened with the majority of cases). We can say that, compared to the other four countries analyzed, Germany was the first country to adopt a relaxation of restrictive measures: Germany began its first steps to ease restrictions on April 20th (during lockdown). Schools were reopened in Germany (C1 = 0.75), and approximately 25% of the students were allowed to go to school. Schools were soon opened in France (on May 11th) but there was a maximum number of 15 students for each classroom (C1 = 0.5). During Phase Two in Spain and Italy, schools continued to be closed. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that when Germany entered Phase Two, it had not imposed any restrictions on internal movement of citizens. Further, Italy was the only country that renounced the stay-at-home requirements immediately when it entered the Phase Two.\n\nConsistent evidence can be observed in our study and in others previously published on the impact of restrictions’ ease. In particular, our findings on restrictive measures’ effects are in line with the findings from Flaxman and colleagues [12] who assessed the impact of different NPIs among 11 European countries, but not their effects. Flaxman and colleagues reported clearly that several NPIs (e.g., school closure and public events ban) combined with lockdown had a large effect (81%) on reducing transmission. Our findings are also consistent with results from a 131 cross-country study by Li and colleagues [28]. They observed that individual NPIs are associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs is delayed by 1–3 weeks, with a longer delay occurring when NPIs are lifted: a resurgence in Covid-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs.\n\nBased on our observations, France and the UK had a small number of positive cases at the beginning of the pandemic and during lockdown, while Spain experienced high caseloads during the first wave of the pandemic and a constant increase of positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 during the second phase.\n\nFurther, looking at the evolution of the epidemic curves in the different countries, if we assume that lockdown containment measures were not eased (i.e., predictions until T2 + 30, the dotted line in the Fig. 3), we obtain interesting information when comparing countries. If the total blocking measures were prolonged, they would have led to a greater reduction of cases in the UK (− 5.9%), France (− 4.9%), Germany (− 3.3%) and Spain (− 2.4%), while Italy (+ 0.5%) would not have achieved substantial improvements (the zeroing target had already been achieved).\n\nWhen speculating about possible reasons for the different effects in easing lockdown measures, we mainly observed different behaviors related to school measures. Schools remained closed in Phase Two in Italy and in Spain while the other three countries gradually reopened (C1 was 0.75 at the beginning of Phase Two in France, in Germany and in the UK). In Germany, only the last year of each school level restarted (approximately 25% of students). In France, kindergarten and primary school children returned to school on a voluntary basis, middle schools were gradually reopened in the green zones while they remained closed in red zones. Like France, the UK began easing restrictions on schools starting with the opening of kindergarten and primary school.\n\nAs for other parameters such as businesses and workplaces, shops and retail, hospitality, personal care activities, assembly and leisure, internal movement, stay at home and gatherings, only Italy adopted targeted restrictions before the lockdown and Germany only had partially adopted restrictions for shops and retail, hospitality, assembly and leisure, and gatherings. In Italy, the early partial - and then total - restrictions concerning all the mentioned parameters can justify the good result reached by the predictive model T2 + 30. Furthermore, based on the number of Covid-19 cases, Germany was the first to introduce targeted measures (at 0.02 total cases per 100 K population) and Spain the last one (at 4,94 total cases per 100 K population). The UK entered lockdown with the same number of cases as France (10 total cases per 100 K population), but the UK started applying the restrictive measures a week later than France and without previous targeted measures reporting a number of Covid-19 cases almost double than France at the beginning of Phase Two (407 cases per 100 K in the UK vs. 214 cases per 100 K in France).\n\nThe results of our model speculate the evolution of the pandemic curve if the containment measures were prolonged and suggest that all the countries except Italy would have benefited from longer restrictions at the time of Phase One, although it was not possible to clearly quantify the contribution different behaviors had. Overall, we can say that there were three main factors that affected the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the above mentioned European countries: 1) the time when containment measures were adopted according to the epidemic curve (the earlier were the better); 2) the duration of containment measure adoption (2 weeks of early restrictive measures before the lockdown gave better results than no restrictive measures before the lockdown); 3) the number of Covid-19 cases before easing containment measures (the fewer the better before concluding the lockdown). We agree with Iezadi S et al. that the NPIs has had successful impacts on containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, despite the substantial impacts on economies and mental health. In addition to addressing issues regarding universal access to vaccines, considering the severe consequences of national lockdown and other restrictions, these interventions should be accompanied or mitigated by the adoption of other NPIs such as contact tracing, the use of face masks and suspected/patient case isolation strategies [31].\n\nGovernmental policies were found to play a crucial role in delaying the Covid-19 infection early spread [32] and the Case fatality rate, CFR [33]. From a detailed analysis regarding the introduction of some restrictive measures (nine analyzed parameters) in the five countries of our study (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and their subsequent lifting, their importance for the mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic has emerged. In fact, the UK began to tackle SARS-CoV-2 with restrictive measures later than others and, despite having applied these measures for a long time, had greater difficulty in the fight against the virus. On the other hand, Italy, the first European country to be hit and to promptly implement the restrictive measures on all nine parameters analyzed, would not have benefited from a possible extension of the lockdown. In Germany, the restrictive measures were applied promptly but in a much milder way than in the other four countries; despite having the lowest number of cases (per 100 k population) when Phase Two started, the country would have possibly benefited from prolonged restrictive measures. France began rather promptly to adopt the restrictive measures against SARS-CoV-2 but the lockdown lasted only 8 weeks and the country would have benefited from a delayed entry into Phase Two. Spain applied restrictions limited to some regions during the lockdown. It was the country that entered Phase Two with the largest number of cases.\n\nReintroducing or easing restrictions are undoubtedly important decisions for governments because they have a relevant impact on the economy as well as on the psychological integrity and health of the population. For this reason, such decisions should be made by weighing many factors, including the epidemiological situation of the country, the capacity and resilience of the health system and the attitude and habits of the population. Our findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy makers’ decisions on introducing and relaxing of the different containment measures and their timing. Given the features of the Covid-19 pandemic, extensive case findings and isolations would be required to progressively lower the intensity of interventions and allow for the partial release of the socio-economic pressure and avoid the healthcare system exceeding saturation. We can only end the pandemic in one place by ending the pandemic everywhere. The entire world has the same goal: decrease Covid-19 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 countries’ response was very different: in some cases it was a failure, in others a success. Surely the most important lesson learned is that we can definitely defeat the invisible enemy and its emerging variants by improving our knowledge about the virus, its effects and how to contain both.\n\nLimitation of the study\n\nOverall, we acknowledge challenges and limitations regarding our analyses and interpretation of Covid-19 dynamics. First of all, in the initial phase of the pandemic, overall detection and reporting of positive cases was less accurate than in the following periods, causing models to learn from a likely underestimated total cases curve [34, 35]. Second, at the beginning, the number of tests (swabs) was insufficient, so a great majority of asymptomatic subjects were not tested. Third, we are aware that there might be gaps in the data used, in some specific days or due to country-specific reporting systems. In case of missing information, we replaced it with linear interpolation between adjacent observations. Fourth, as for the different containment actions, our scoring system considers the start and end dates as well as the level of restriction declared by each country according to our investigation. The level of compliance from population is not considered as it was not possible to properly measure it.\n\nWe acknowledge also limitations of the SEIR method used in our analysis: the removed subjects (R) are the recovered and dead cases that are assumed to be immune to the disease and would not be reintroduced to the susceptible (S). Model performances (and predictions generated) highly depend on accuracy, transparency, and promptness of data used as inputs. Related to this, in some cases, countries implemented changes in the reporting and testing approach, which would potentially affect the reported dynamics for case evolution. As for the model, as expected, accuracy of predictions decreases along time and models implemented in the Covid-19 Active Cases Curve Simulator maximize short term (7-day) predictions. Also, it is important to underline that predictions at each step for each country are generated by the models under the assumptions that conditions are not varying. In our speculations, we have considered “what if” lockdown measure continued for some weeks more, but predictions cannot take into account additional external factors such as changes in populations’ behaviors (self-reducing contacts, limiting social activities, increased hygiene/disinfection in everyday life).'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25433800-100-zero-covid-strategies-are-being-ditched-but-they-were-the-best-option/', 'Headline': 'Zero-covid strategies are being ditched, but they were the best option', 'Snippet': 'A 2021 study found there was greater economic growth in zero-covid countries than in those that let the virus spread.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/news-release/2022/areaemployment_chicago_20220930.htm', 'Headline': 'Chicago Area Employment - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Snippet': 'Total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI, metropolitan area increased by 201,200 over the year in August. ...

The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to decrease volatility in estimation.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available online at https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/benchmark.htm.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Measures of sampling error for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions at www.bls.gov/web/laus/790stderr.htm.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018.

However, prosecutors later dropped the charges against her.\n\nBabbitt was killed during the Capitol riot, where she was seen wearing a Donald Trump flag as a cape. She was attempting to crawl through a broken window in the interior of the Capitol where lawmakers were still present in the Speaker’s Lobby. Although Capitol police officers warned the rioters to stay out, they continued to push inside.\n\nA Capitol police officer fired a shot at her while she was midway through a window, hitting her neck; she later died at a Washington DC hospital from the gunshot wound.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://nypost.com/2022/01/06/ashli-babbitts-mom-defends-daughters-actions-at-jan-6riot/', 'Headline': ""Ashli Babbitt's mom defends daughter's actions at Jan. 6riot"", 'Snippet': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps on the riot’s anniversary to claim that her daughter was exercising her right to protest ...', 'Full_text': 'The mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman fatally shot during the Jan. 6 riot, stood on the Capitol steps Thursday and claimed her daughter was exercising a legitimate right to protest when she was killed by a US Capitol police officer one year ago.\n\n“My daughter was an amazing, energetic, independent, powerful woman. I miss her every day,” Micki Witthoeft said through tears as members of Congress gathered inside to remember the first anniversary of the attacks.\n\n“I’m here because Americans do have the right to protest, it’s your right as an American citizen to protest,” she continued.\n\nBabbitt, a 36-year-old Air Force veteran, was shot by US Capitol Police officer Lt. Michael Byrd as she tried to crawl through a broken window to enter the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021 as a mob of Trump supporters were storming the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“My daughter was a proud American patriot,” Witthoeft said. “She served this country her whole adult life. She loved God, America and loved her family.”\n\nWitthoeft then claimed her daughter was “murdered by a careless, reckless” Capitol Police officer.\n\n“She came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election, and little did we know that would be the last time she heard anybody speak,” the grieving mom said.\n\nByrd was exonerated of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death in an internal use-of-force probe.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last August, Byrd said he was “doing my job” and saw Babbitt as a threat to lawmakers in the House of Representatives.\n\n“I was very afraid,” Byrd told anchor Lester Holt. “I’m hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.”\n\nWitthoeft also called for the release of 14,000 hours of video captured on security cameras in the Capitol.\n\n“I would like to say to [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, this is not your playhouse. These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day and the American people have the right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,” she said. “You’re not the queen, Nancy Pelosi, this is America’s 14,000 hours of missing footage and we have a right to see it.”\n\nCapitol Police and prosecutors have refused to release the footage, because they contend it could threaten the security of the building.\n\nBut federal judge Beryl Howell ruled in September that the “public has an interest in understanding the conduct underlying the charges in these cases” and ordered the footage to be released in the trial of protester Eric Torrens of Tennessee.\n\n“The Capitol police operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,” Witthoeft said.\n\n“I think most of America does not know the Capitol police department is not subject to transparency – they are another arm of Congress and don’t answer to an external review like every other police department in this country,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 725 people for their involvement in the Capitol attacks.\n\nWitthoeft said those arrested are being held unfairly.\n\n“We have political prisoners in America, not some third world country, to this day in solitary confinement denied due process. Most of them veterans, who fought for their right to be in this country, to exercise their First Amendment right to protest — and they are being denied the rights they fought for,” she said.\n\nAs Congress marked the anniversary with a moment of silence and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered speeches, a few supporters of the Jan. 6 effort gathered nearby.\n\nKeith Scott, who described himself as a proud Capitol rioter, traveled to DC from Corpus Christi, Texas, to observe the anniversary.\n\n“It was the greatest day of my life,” he said as he stood near the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the base of Capitol Hill.\n\n“I felt like a patriot – like a patriot before the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and I still feel that way.”\n\nBut he said he was disappointed the anniversary didn’t draw other supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n“Loyal Trump supporters are worn out,” he said.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-manufactured-martyr-ashli-babbitt-191518760.html', 'Headline': 'Trump’s ‘manufactured martyr’: How Ashli Babbitt’s death was weaponised ...', 'Snippet': 'Others left messages such as ""Pelosi’s police murdered a patriot"", ""SAY HER NAME!"", and claims that Babbitt was set up or suggestions that Mr Byrd was guarding a hard drive full of incriminating ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot', 'Headline': 'Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot', 'Snippet': 'Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber.

A September summary prepared by the attorney general\'s Special Investigations Section showed it had not turned up evidence that backed up the claims.\n\n""In each instance and in each matter, the aforementioned parties did not provide any evidence to support their allegations,"" the previously unreleased summary said. ""The information that was provided was speculative in many instances and when investigated by our agents and support staff, was found to be inaccurate.""\n\nAccording to the summary, the agents looked over 638 complaints, which led to 430 investigations into information provided to agents that was ""speculative in many instances"" and that when investigated was ""found to be inaccurate."" Only 22 cases were ultimately submitted for prosecutorial review, and at the time of the report, two indictments were obtained stemming from ballot harvesting.\n\nElected officials who had made public statements alleging voter fraud ""did not repeat or make such assertions when questioned by our agents,"" the summary said.\n\nAs he was running for what ended up being a failed bid for the GOP nomination for the Senate, Brnovich issued an interim report in April addressed to then-Senate President Karen Fann, raising concerns about some voting procedures.\n\nAlthough that report did not find mass fraud or conspiracy in the 2020 election, it outlined his office’s concerns with “serious vulnerabilities” involving certain procedures during the campaign, including the signature verification process and the transportation of ballots from drop box locations.\n\nThe interim report left out edits from agents who said they had not found evidence of criminality or fraud, according to a draft of the interim report released by Mayes\' office with edits and suggestions made by attorney general’s agents.\n\nBrnovich, who left office last month, did not release the investigative summary of his office\'s findings that was put together in September.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report on the series of documents released by Mayes\' office.\n\nBrnovich did not respond to a message on Twitter seeking comment. He did not respond to questions from the Post, according to the newspaper.\n\nMayes took office last month after he defeated Republican Abraham Hamadeh, who questioned President Joe Biden’s victory and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, in Arizona’s attorney general’s race last year.\n\n“The results of this exhaustive and extensive investigation show what we have suspected for over two years — the 2020 election in Arizona was conducted fairly and accurately by elections officials,” Mayes said in a statement. “The ten thousand plus hours spent diligently investigating every conspiracy theory under the sun distracted this office from its core mission of protecting the people of Arizona from real crime and fraud.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-2020-election-alternate-electors-scheme-arizona-investigation/', 'Headline': 'Arizona AG investigating 2020 alleged fake electors tied to Trump', 'Snippet': ""August 17, 2023 / 4:48 PM EDT / CBS News.

How long the investigation has been underway, its status, and its scope, are not clear. Mayes, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the investigation on Wednesday.\n\n""We are taking this investigation very seriously, very solemnly,"" Mayes told local media this week, adding ""we\'re going to do it on our timetable as justice demands.""\n\nThe Arizona probe takes place as Trump and 18 of his associates face charges of racketeering, election fraud and other charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over an alleged effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including the alternate elector scheme.

Mayes pledged to investigate the alleged fake electors scheme.\n\nMultiple GOP candidates in Arizona, a longtime swing state, who ran in 2022 insisted that President Biden did not rightfully win the 2020 election.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over ... - Reuters', 'Snippet': ""The U.S. has suspended federal funding to China's Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) for failing to provide documentation related to concerns over biosafety protocol violations at the facility that ..."", 'Full_text': ''}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/us/politics/funding-ban-wuhan-institute-virology.html', 'Headline': 'Biden Administration Moves to Ban Funding for Wuhan Lab', 'Snippet': 'The Biden administration is taking steps to impose a 10-year ban on funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese research laboratory at the center of a heated debate over the origins ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-212306571.html', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance - Yahoo', 'Snippet': ""120.

A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received either a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.\n\nMany countries started to administer additional doses toward the end of 2021 after research found that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. More than 2.72 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide. Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the manufacturers of two of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccinations, have developed updated vaccines that more effectively protect against the newer Omicron variant. These are currently being administered in many countries, including the United States and Britain.\n\nVaccination rates around the world have stagnated in recent months, with public demand dropping even as vaccine supply has become more abundant.\n\nEarly leads in vaccination rates have become entrenched. Africa has the lowest vaccination rate of any continent, with just 37.2 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 82.3 percent in Latin America.\n\nMore than two-dozen different vaccines have been used worldwide, according to data from Our World in Data.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938', 'Headline': 'Coronavirus tracker: the latest figures as countries fight the Covid-19 ...', 'Snippet': 'This FT Covid-19 vaccination tracker is updated every hour with the latest data on progress in administering coronavirus inoculations in more than 60 countries and territories around the world ...', 'Full_text': 'The human cost of coronavirus has continued to mount, with more than 274m cases confirmed globally and more than 5.3m people known to have died.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic in March 2020 and it has spread to more than 200 countries, with severe public health and economic consequences.

From mid-April, focus shifted to the US, where the number of deaths has remained consistently high, although the focus of the epidemic has shifted from the northeast to other regions of the country. Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic in the summer of 2020, with the region accounting for almost a half of deaths each day. However, the surge in Europe since the autumn means Covid-19 remains a global pandemic.\n\nWith several vaccines approved for use, the race is now on for countries to vaccinate their populations:\n\nThere are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that numbers of deaths in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.\n\nThere are several different ways of comparing excess deaths figures between countries. In absolute numbers, more people than would usually be expected have died in the in the US than in any of the other countries for which recent all-cause mortality data is available.\n\nAdjusting for typical mortality rates, the five hardest hit countries worldwide where data is available are all in Latin America. Peru has seen more than double the number of deaths it sees in a typical year, and neighbouring Ecuador has seen a 67 per cent increase. Nicaragua (a 59 per cent rise), Bolivia (56) and Mexico (55) complete the top five.\n\nReporting, data analysis and graphics by Steven Bernard, David Blood, John Burn-Murdoch, Oliver Elliott, Max Harlow, Joanna S Kao, William Rohde Madsen, Caroline Nevitt, Alan Smith, Martin Stabe, Cale Tilford and Aleksandra Wisniewska.

We used latent class growth analysis to determine patterns (or classes) of pandemic-related food insecurity during a 1-year period.\n\nResults\n\nWe found 10 classes of trajectories of food insecurity, including 1 class of consistent food security (64.7%), 1 class of consistent food insecurity (3.4%), 5 classes of decreasing food insecurity (15.8%), 2 classes of increasing food insecurity (4.6%), and 1 class of stable but elevated food insecurity (11.6%). Relative to the class that remained food secure, other classes were younger, had a greater proportion of women, and tended to identify with a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of food insecurity were highly variable across the US population, with one-third experiencing some form of food insecurity risk. Findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nFood insecurity — which occurs when access to adequate food to live a healthy life is limited by a lack of money or other resources — is a major public health problem in the US that contributes substantially to the burden of chronic disease and poor mental health (1). Food insecurity results in an estimated $77 billion each year in excess health care spending (2). More than 1 in 10 US households experienced food insecurity in 2020 (3). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce the national prevalence of food insecurity to 6%, and this is now the target for Healthy People 2030 (4).\n\nAlong with illness and death in the US (5) and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a cascade of economic and social disruptions that increased food insecurity, particularly in its earliest months (6). Data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey showed that food insufficiency (a severe form of food insecurity) rose from 8% in March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 (7). Some households, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino households and households with children, were found to be more vulnerable than other households to food insecurity as a result of the pandemic (3,7). In addition to these national prevalence studies, other studies have estimated food insecurity to be much higher in some samples (8,9); these studies differed in sample representation (online convenience vs community-based samples), study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), and food insecurity measures (single vs multiple items) (3,6–9).\n\nThe growing body of evidence shows that experiences of COVID-19 pandemic–related food insecurity varied substantially across the US population. However, most epidemiologic studies cross-sectionally assessed food insecurity during a reference period (eg, the previous 12 months) and did not follow respondents over time to examine variability of experiences during that time. This is an important research gap, because most households with food insecurity tend to experience episodic rather than chronic food insecurity (10). Few studies have characterized the variability of food insecurity over time (11). Measurement of the timing of food insecurity in a more granular fashion has led to important public health and clinical outcomes, including increased use of emergency departments and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia at the end of the month versus earlier weeks of the month based on claims data (12).\n\nThe objective of our study was to characterize the heterogeneity in food insecurity during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified trajectories through repeated measures data that assessed the probability food insecurity every 2 weeks in a nationally representative US sample. Characterizing the heterogeneity in food insecurity during this pivotal period is important to inform public health efforts to reduce food insecurity and its associated health harms, to monitor the impact of food insecurity–related policies, and to prioritize efforts designed for populations at greatest risk of persistent food insecurity.\n\nTop\n\nMethods\n\nData source and sampling\n\nWe used publicly available and deidentified data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel study of approximately 9,500 adult respondents conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California. Launched in 2014, UAS is an internet panel study that uses an address-based probability sampling strategy and provides internet-connected tablets to respondents to minimize the effects of the digital divide for online survey completion. Each survey of the UAS is approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review board. In March 2020, UAS launched the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, a longitudinal series of surveys that assessed economic and health-related indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered every 2 weeks from March 10, 2020, through March 30, 2021, then monthly through July 20, 2021.\n\nFor this study, we analyzed data from waves 2 through 25, or April 1, 2020, through March 30, 2021, because these waves occurred during the first year of the pandemic and had consistent measures of food insecurity. A total of 8,425 unique participants responded to at least 1 survey during the study period. We excluded participants from analysis if they did not complete more than 1 survey (n = 429) or did not provide at least 2 waves of responses to the food insecurity measures (n = 52), yielding a total sample of 7,944 unique respondents. On average, these respondents completed 21.3 (SD, 4.7) waves for a total of 148,392 surveys. Of these surveys, 98.6% (n = 146,265) had responses to food insecurity measures. Participants provided informed consent before completing their first survey either electronically or on paper. More information on the survey methodology and sampling can be found at https://uasdata.usc.edu.\n\nMeasures\n\nFood insecurity. Three survey items were adapted from the US Department of Agriculture’s US Household Food Security Survey (13), designed to assess food insecurity in the previous 12 months. Understanding Coronavirus in America survey respondents were asked the following questions in reference to the past 7 days: 1) “Were you worried you would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?” 2) “Did you eat less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?” and 3) “Did you go without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?” Answer choices were yes, no, or unsure. For the 3 questions, unsure accounted for 2.6%, 2.1%, and 1.4% of responses, respectively. Given prior research on social desirability bias when assessing food insecurity (14) and the small number of unsure responses, we considered yes and unsure to be affirmative responses. In total, 8.9% of surveys were affirmative for item 1, 7.9% for item 2, and 4.2% for item 3. We coded food insecurity status (binary outcome) as affirmative (yes or unsure) to any of the 3 items.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics were age, binary sex, marital status, race (White or Caucasian [hereinafter White], Black or African American, Native American/American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), educational attainment, annual household income, employment status, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, household composition (no children in household vs children in household), and US Census Bureau–designated geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). Sociodemographic factors are based on responses to participants’ first survey, collected from April 1, 2020, through March 2, 2021.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) (15) to identify clusters of people (ie, latent classes) based on variability in their binary response of any food insecurity over time. LCGA is a longitudinal clustering technique that uses latent (unobserved) variables (16,17) and has similarities to other trajectory modeling techniques, including latent growth mixture modeling, but LCGA does not allow for within-class variation in trajectories (18). Classes identified by LCGA are not known a priori and are determined empirically, but because a substantial proportion of survey participants were observed to have no change in food insecurity status over time, we assigned them to either a class that remained food secure or a class that remained insecure throughout the study period (n = 5,317) (19).\n\nWe estimated a trajectory shape for each class, and participants (n = 2,627) were assigned to latent classes according to their posterior probabilities (20). The 1-class solution was first specified, which was then used as a comparison for solutions of increasing class size until the best solution was identified. To identify the optimal number of classes, we evaluated statistical indices and tests and parameter estimates, including likelihood ratio tests, such as the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin test and Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted test, entropy, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample-size adjusted BIC, corrected AIC for small sample sizes, and assessment of class cell sizes (16) (Supplemental Table 1 in Appendix). We created a graph in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) of the average probability of endorsing food insecurity at each time within each cluster.\n\nThe food insecurity outcome was binary and represented any affirmative indication of food insecurity. We therefore relied on a commonly used approach for a latent variable model for a binary outcome, which was to assume that a normally distributed latent variable (food insecurity*) exists, from which participants respond affirmatively when the latent variable exceeds some threshold (16). That is, in these models, for individual i across time points\n\nFood Insecurityi = Yes if τ < Food Insecurityi*\n\nwhere τ is the threshold parameter.\n\nThe interpretation of the model coefficients in our LCGA followed from probit analyses. That is, within each cluster, the model coefficient for the linear slope is the change in the z score of a normal distribution for a 1-unit change in time. We assumed linear growth in food insecurity after evaluating descriptive plots and generalized estimating equations models of the longitudinal data in the entire sample. We used the MLR option in Mplus to estimate the model (21), which uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters but uses a robust sandwich-type estimator (Huber–White sandwich estimator) to calculate SEs (22). Robust approaches are resistant to errors under small violations of parametric assumptions. Our model also effectively handled ignorable missing data dependent on the data in hand (ie, following a missing-at-random assumption) via full information maximum likelihood. As a result, participants with missing data could still be included in the trajectory analysis for unbiased inference. In total, 80.0% of surveys were completed by all participants with responses to food insecurity questions. We examined sociodemographic factors across each trajectory for descriptive purposes in post hoc analyses.\n\nWe defined α = .05 for our level of significance in all statistical tests, which were 2-tailed. We conducted LCGA in Mplus version 8.6 (21). We used R program in the R studio environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for data management and graphic displays, and we used the MplusAutomation package to automate LCGA estimation and interpretation (23). Sample weights were not included in the LCGA but were used to calculate summary statistics and summarize sociodemographic characteristics, which were calculated by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nTop\n\nResults\n\nApproximately two-thirds (60.0%) of the sample at first survey were aged 18 to 50 years (Table 1). Just over half of the sample identified as female (53.9%), were married (53.4%), and were currently working (57.2%). The proportion of self-identified race and ethnicity in this sample generally mirrored the overall US population; for race, 75.9% identified as White only, 13.0% as Black only, and 5.6% as Asian only. For ethnicity, 19.1% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Approximately one-third had a bachelor’s degree or more (33.8%), earned more than $75,000 annually (34.4%), had children in the household (34.7%), and were living in the South (38.8%).\n\nFood insecurity trajectories\n\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, the prevalence of any food insecurity was as high as 20.4%. The prevalence decreased to 8.9% by March 2021, with most of the decline occurring in the early months, before leveling off in mid-2020 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of any food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Shading indicates 95% CIs. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nWe identified 10 unique trajectories of food insecurity (Figure 2), including the 2 trajectories that were empirically assigned (remained food secure and remained food insecure). Each trajectory can be described by the shape of its curve: 3 trajectories showed little change (remained insecure, remained elevated, and remained secure), 2 trajectories indicated a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a precipitous decline (named “initial shock 1” and “initial shock 2”), 3 trajectories with a high probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of decline (named “recovering 1,” “recovering 2,” and “recovering 3”), and 2 trajectories with a relatively low probability of initial food insecurity followed by a steady state of incline (named “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2”).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nProbability of experiencing food insecurity among respondents (N = 7,944) to the Understanding America Study, Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey, April 2020 through March 2021. Three categories (remained secure, remained insecure, and remained elevated) were characterized as consistent. Two categories (initial shock 1 and initial shock 2) were characterized by a rapid decline in food insecurity status between March and July 2020. Three categories (recovering 1, recovering 2, and recovering 3) were defined as having experienced food insecurity initially, with the likelihood steadily declining during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories (became insecure 1 and became insecure 2) were defined as steadily becoming food insecure during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration. [A tabular version of this figure is available.]\n\nAlthough most (64.7%) of the US-representative sample was in the “remained secure” category, 35.3% experienced some form of food insecurity (with 3.4% remaining insecure) during the first year of the pandemic (Table 2). Within that 35.3%, we found much variability. In addition to the 2 groups whose food security/insecurity status did not change, another group showed minimal changes: this group was mostly food secure during the study period but had an elevated prevalence of food insecurity, beginning at 13.6% in April 2020 and ending at 7.5% in March 2021. This group, “remained elevated,” comprised 11.6% of the study population.\n\nFive groups experienced some early form of food insecurity, but their probability of being food insecure declined over time. Two such trajectories, initial shock 1 (4.6% of the study population) and initial shock 2 (3.2% of the study population), appear to have briefly experienced food insecurity. This experience may have been largely related to the initial economic shutdowns in the earliest months of the pandemic in 2020, wherein states and municipalities issued stay-at-home or lockdown orders to mitigate the spread of the virus. These 2 trajectories are distinguished by the length of time needed for food insecurity to be resolved. Participants classified as initial shock 1 took about 16 weeks to resolve, while initial shock 2 was resolved within 8 weeks.\n\nThree groups took longer to recover from food insecurity experienced earlier in the pandemic: “recovering 1” (4.3%) ended the first year at a slightly elevated probability of food insecurity, while “recovering 2” (2.6%) and “recovering 3” (1.1%) had a similar rate or slope of recovery but a different initial probability of food insecurity.\n\nThe probability of becoming food insecure increased during the first year of the pandemic for 2 groups. These 2 trajectories, “became insecure 1” (3.1%) and “became insecure 2” (1.5%), had nearly the same rate or slope of becoming food insecure but their initial probability of food insecurity differed.\n\nAlthough small sample sizes and corresponding wide 95% CIs in some groups precluded a statistical comparison of sociodemographic characteristics across trajectories, characteristics appeared to differ in several ways (Supplemental Table 2A and 2B in Appendix). Those who remained food secure, compared with those in other trajectories, tended to be older, self-identified as White, and had a greater income at first interview.\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is among the first to describe population-level longitudinal patterns in the development, resolution, or persistence of food insecurity during a key time of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing heterogeneity in food insecurity experiences during this period. Notably, one-third of the population was found to experience any food insecurity when assessed longitudinally, whether food insecurity existed from the start and persisted (for approximately 15%), improved (for approximately 16%), or worsened (for approximately 5%). With careful attention to not overextend the findings of this initial study, we also observed that certain patterns of food insecurity corresponded with pivotal periods during the first year of the pandemic, starting with abrupt and widespread economic shutdowns in the earliest months. We found 2 patterns of food insecurity that occurred mainly in the earliest months of the pandemic before resolving relatively shortly thereafter (ie, initial shock 1 and initial shock 2). Therefore, an important consideration raised by our findings relates to the definition and measurement of food insecurity when accounting for the many factors that drive food insecurity.\n\nWhile food insecurity at the individual level occurs when access to adequate food is limited or uncertain because of a lack of money or other resources (13), the pillars of food security in a global context also include availability, use, and stability (24). The pandemic introduced a host of other factors described elsewhere (ie, business and school closures, supply chain issues, and stockpiling of groceries and resulting shortages) (6,25) that affected experiences of food insecurity for reasons beyond a person’s lack of access caused by money. Our findings, particularly data on the initial shock 1 and initial shock 2 groups, may speak to food insecurity experiences that were driven more by societal disruptions than by economic or financial uncertainty at the individual level. For instance, while worrying about running out of food before being able to buy more is a key screening question for food insecurity (14), affirmative responses to this question could have also been driven by factors that go beyond having enough money for food. That respondents in the initial shock 2 group appeared to share similar sociodemographic characteristics with respondents in the group that remained food secure raises new considerations in defining and measuring food insecurity in the context of a novel global pandemic.\n\nSeveral patterns of food insecurity described here, such as the one for people who remained food insecure during the entire study period, are particularly concerning. Because nearly half of those in the remained insecure group were SNAP recipients at the outset of the study period, this group may represent a small but important population for whom existing food insecurity protection policies were already not sufficient or whose food insecurity was not being adequately addressed before the pandemic. Groups that showed increases in the probability of food insecurity over time also warrant attention; 2 groups, “became insecure 1” and “became insecure 2,” were worse off 1 year after the onset of the pandemic than at the beginning. Although small sample sizes preclude us from making reliable sociodemographic comparisons, findings suggest that the initial probability of food insecurity distinguished the trajectories of these 2 groups.\n\nSeveral lessons can be learned from populations that experienced food insecurity early in the pandemic but either recovered entirely or were headed toward recovery 1 year later. In studies of food insecurity after other large-scale and highly disruptive events, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana (26) and Hurricane Harvey in Texas (27), findings highlighted several sociodemographic characteristics as protective factors (ie, income, partner status) and risk factors (ie, low levels of social support, poor physical or mental health, female sex/gender) for remaining food insecure in the year(s) after the events. Notably absent in the literature is substantive longitudinal research on the impact of recovery policies. Given the wide berth of policies implemented in the US in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial opportunity exists to explore how these policies, such as those directly aimed at reducing food insecurity or unemployment, may have contributed to each trajectory to identify what aspects of each policy either contributed to recovery or inhibited it.\n\nA wealth of research demonstrates the relationship among income, employment status, and food insecurity. However, the confluence of various local, state, and federal responses to the pandemic provides a unique microcosm for examining a more direct impact on food insecurity. One multisite analysis found that food insecurity was highest during the pandemic among those who experienced job disruptions (28). The initial expiration of unemployment insurance at the federal level at the end of July 2020, along with the general uncertainty about its extension or even the future COVID-19 landscape, likely played a role in the upward trend in overall food insecurity observed around August 2020 (29,30). Further work in this area may entail examining how the economic impact of business closures and unemployment insurance claims (31) may have affected trajectories of food insecurity. For instance, researchers could examine the association of food insecurity trajectories with the comparative efficiency with which states implemented unemployment policies. Furthermore, research using other data sources would be necessary to examine the influence of policies such as the expanded child tax credit.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has several limitations. Measures of food insecurity were examined only during the first year of the pandemic and did not account for food insecurity experienced before the pandemic nor their trajectory as the pandemic extended beyond March 2021. This study also assumed that all LCGA model assumptions were met in this sample for valid inference (ie, within-class multivariate normality) (32). We did perform more robust inference in case model parametric assumptions that were violated. Another limitation is that in our chosen 10-class solution, some classes had small cell sizes, and the entropy values and some of the averages of posterior probability of membership were low (2 clusters had an average posterior probability of membership below the threshold of 0.70 considered as a general guideline for adequate assignment accuracy) (33). Thus, we chose as our selection criteria global model fit and thorough interpretability of the possible clustering in this data (ie, more clusters, each unique in characteristic) over a more precise solution involving fewer classes. The small sample sizes in some classes preclude formal comparisons of sociodemographic differences across classes, although we note that those who remained food secure tended to belong to historically advantaged sociodemographic groups, whereas racial and ethnic minority populations were more likely to experience other trajectories of food insecurity (34). Across the 10 classes that were identified here, the group least vulnerable to food insecurity — remained secure — had the highest proportion of respondents who self-identified as White, earned an annual income exceeding $75,000 per year, and had completed a bachelor’s degree or more.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur findings highlighted population-level heterogeneity in the experience of food insecurity in the US throughout the first year of the pandemic, particularly in demonstrating the large variability of population response to the pandemic in food insecurity experiences. These initial findings have implications for identifying population groups who are at increased risk of food insecurity and food-insecurity–related health disparities beyond the first year of the pandemic, with particular attention to those whose risk remained high, remained elevated, or increased over time. The findings here also provide an opportunity and suggest a need for public health researchers to take a more granular look at how policies may have affected food insecurity during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nTop\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe project described in this article relies on data from survey(s) administered by the UAS, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California (USC).

Children were especially vulnerable: 144 million children under five were stunted (low height-for-age). 47 million children were affected by wasting, a life-threatening form of malnutrition.\n\nAs nutrition policy expert Rebecca Heidkamp and co-authors wrote in a Nature study, “the world was already not on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2—to eliminate hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.”\n\nThe goal of their study was to model the potential short- and long-term impacts the pandemic would have on nutrition and recommend policies to mitigate damage.\n\nWith modeling tools, they were able to determine potential impacts under optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios from 2020 to 2022. One big challenge was that the pandemic itself interfered with capturing critical data—in this case, an exact count of wasted and stunted children.\n\n“We’ve been struggling to know what the actual impacts have been,” says Heidkamp, PhD, an associate scientist in International Health who specializes in developing nutrition policy in low- and middle-income countries. At the start of the pandemic, UN agencies, including WHO and UNICEF, were dependent on phone surveys to collect data. This meant researchers “couldn’t go out and actually measure women and children,” she says, and “that’s what we care about in nutrition.”\n\nThe study points to evidence from phone surveys in Asia and Africa revealing disruptions in food supply chains and a spike in food prices resulted in dramatic increases in poverty and food insecurity in 2020, forcing families to shift to poorer diets.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, countries like India and Brazil have adapted and scaled up government assistance programs and social safety net programs, such as social protection and cash and food transfers, but public health experts predict these efforts will be insufficient to return to living standards seen prior to the pandemic.\n\nStanding Together for Nutrition: A Trusted, Unified Voice\n\nEarly in the pandemic, lockdowns especially posed a threat to global nutrition efforts, including the disbursement of iron supplements through prenatal care for pregnant people at high risk of anemia; food assistance for families, such as staples like flour, cereal, beans, and lentils; and routine interventions to prevent and treat acute malnutrition. In addition, school closures halted school feeding programs.\n\nThe crisis led to the creation of a research and advocacy consortium involving several Bloomberg School faculty including Heidkamp, called Standing Together for Nutrition, or ST4N.\n\nThe group includes nutrition, economics, and food and health systems experts. Their goal: to identify the potential impacts of COVID—and now the war in Ukraine—on food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and ultimately recommend nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality.\n\n“Now rising costs of products used to treat malnutrition are threatening to interrupt those programs as they cannot reach as many, even as the need goes up,” says Heidkamp.\n\nThe study reports that in 2019, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 150 million people in 81 different countries needed food assistance. In February of 2022, it rose to 276 million people. The agency predicts that number to increase to 323 million this year alone.\n\nHeidkamp anticipates that 2022 will be a big advocacy year for nutrition. “There are many challenges as we look ahead. … but we need to keep shining the light on these issues and figure out who the right global players will be,” she says.\n\nIn the Nature piece, Heidkamp and co-authors urge “governments, donors, and the UN to help prevent a major exacerbation of malnutrition.” They recommend succinct steps these players must take to build more sustainable food systems that can help support affordable and nutritious diets for all:\n\nEnd trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition.\n\nSustain or implement social protection programs.\n\nProtect national nutrition budgets.\n\nHonor commitments already made.\n\nMobilize more resources for humanitarian assistance.\n\nHeidkamp says it’s donors and affluent groups like the World Bank that have the power to strongly influence other countries toward ending trade restrictions, implementing social protection programs, and activating humanitarian assistance in order to end food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nGrace Fernandez is a communications and marketing specialist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRELATED:'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2022-un-report--global-hunger-numbers-rose-to-as-many-as-828-million-in-2021', 'Headline': 'UN Report: Global hunger numbers rose to as many as 828 million in 2021', 'Snippet': 'The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (1), according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.

The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research.\n\nThe dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia.\n\nThe money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia.\n\nSteele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing.\n\nIn the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter.\n\nA DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/durham-report-fbi-trump-clinton-2016-campaign-f3039e651eeb35a09091c363419e6766', 'Headline': ""Durham report takeaways: A 'seriously flawed' Russia investigation and ..."", 'Snippet': 'A 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was colluding with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.

Flawed research by a former British spy tasked with a sensitive, and political, assignment. And an FBI scrambling against the election-season clock to untangle suspicions about foreign government collusion that it feared could have grave national security implications.\n\nA 306-page report by Justice Department special counsel John Durham is refocusing negative attention on one of the most politically significant investigations in FBI history: the probe into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with Russia to tip the outcome of the election.\n\nThe findings aren’t flattering for the FBI, with Durham asserting that it rushed into the investigation without an adequate basis and routinely ignored or rationalized evidence that undercut its premise. The report catalogs a series of errors — though many were already documented years ago by a separate Justice Department inspector general report, and the FBI says it’s taken several dozen corrective steps on its own.\n\nA look at some of the major findings of the Durham report.\n\nA ‘SERIOUSLY FLAWED’ INVESTIGATION\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the FBI’s decision to open, on July 31, 2016, an investigation into possible criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe probe was initiated after it learned from an Australian diplomat that a Trump campaign associate named George Papadopoulos had claimed to know that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. By that point, it was well known that Russian operatives had hacked Democratic emails, and Trump had even appeared to publicly invite Moscow to go looking for Clinton’s communications.\n\nBut, according to Durham, the FBI rushed into the probe without having any evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign had had any contact with any Russian intelligence officers. It identifies by name the Russia experts in the FBI and other agencies who were never consulted before the investigation was begun and says that had they been, they would have said there was no information pointing to a conspiracy between Russia and the campaign.\n\nThe report contends that the FBI fell prone to “confirmation bias,” repeatedly ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing away evidence that undercut the premise of collusion, including a conversation in which Papadopoulos vigorously denied knowing about any cooperative relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt also says investigators did not corroborate a “single substantive allegation” in a dossier of Democratic-funded research that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and yet continued to cite it in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.\n\nBUT DID IT UNCOVER ‘THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY’ AS TRUMP PREDICTED?\n\nNo, it did not. Despite identifying abundant errors, the report and the broader investigation failed to live up to Trump’s hype. The former president claimed that it would reveal the “crime of the century” and expose a “deep state conspiracy” by high-ranking government officials to derail his candidacy and later his presidency.\n\nBut the report yielded only one conviction — a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee — and the only two other cases that were brought both ended in acquittals at trial. And though Durham accused the FBI of confirmation bias, he did not allege that political bias or partisanship were guiding factors for the FBI’s actions.\n\n‘RIGOR, OBJECTIVITY AND PROFESSIONALISM’\n\nThe FBI responded to criticism of its actions by noting that the conduct occurred under different FBI leadership, months before current Director Christopher Wray took the top job. It also said it had already taken dozens of corrective measures designed to prevent the same problems from recurring.\n\nThose include steps designed to ensure the accuracy of applications the FBI files with the secretive surveillance court when it wants to eavesdrop on the communications of suspected spies and terrorists. For instance, the FBI said, agents must now provide more information, including identifying and disclosing evidence that might undercut their premise that probable cause exists for surveillance. In addition, the FBI has worked to improve oversight of confidential human sources.\n\nThe FBI said in a letter to Durham that it was confident that had those steps been in place in 2016, the “failures detailed in your Report never would have happened.” In a separate statement, it said the report “reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.“\n\nWAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TREATED DIFFERENTLY?\n\nYes, Durham argues. He notes that the FBI in 2016 also investigated allegations in the book “Clinton Cash,” authored by a conservative writer who alleged foreign governments were funneling money to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for access. Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and former President Bill Clinton have long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe FBI labeled its reviews linked to “Clinton Cash” as “preliminary investigations,” Durham said. But the Trump Russia probe, he said, “was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information.”\n\nHe argues the FBI showed caution about possibly influencing Hillary Clinton’s campaign that it did not show for Trump’s campaign.\n\nTo underscore his point, he quotes some of the text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose privately expressed dislike for Trump has long been cited as evidence of bias.\n\n“One more thing: (Clinton) may be our next president,” Page is said to have written Strzok. “The last thing you need (is) going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”\n\nAN UPHILL CLIMB IN CONGRESS GETS STEEPER\n\nThe Durham report is another blow to the FBI as it’s trying to persuade Congress that it is a responsible steward of intelligence.\n\nLawmakers are beginning to debate whether to renew a U.S. surveillance program that captures huge swaths of foreigners’ emails and phone calls. The program authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Durham report calls attention to mistakes that Republicans have already cited as reasons for overhauling Section 702. The FBI did not use Section 702 in surveilling Page.

Bender testified that he compiled the financial statements, called statements of financial condition, using information and ..."", 'Full_text': 'Testimony has wrapped in the $250 million civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump and his company after more than two months of fireworks in and outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe final witness was Eric Lewis, an accounting professor at Cornell University, who New York Attorney General Tish James\'s office put on the stand Wednesday to rebut the testimony of an NYU accounting professor who testified earlier on Trump\'s behalf.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron is expected to issue his verdict and findings sometime next month, after both sides present their closing arguments on Jan. 11.\n\nThe trial started on Oct. 2nd, and there were 44 days of testimony featuring 25 witnesses for the AG\'s office, 19 defense witnesses and two rebuttal witnesses — fewer than originally proposed.\n\nJames\' office set out to show how financial statements Trump used to get favorable loans from banks were steeped in fraud with grossly inflated values. Trump\'s team tried to show he did nothing wrong, that the statements were largely accurate and that any mistakes weren\'t his fault. Along the way were plenty of spectacles, with testimony from the former president and his family members, gag orders, fines, angry exchanges and dramatic showdowns.\n\nHere\'s a look at some key moments from the trial.\n\nA former president on the witness stand\n\nWhile Trump abruptly decided not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week, the former president spent a remarkable day on the witness stand as part of the AG\'s case last month, where he repeatedly ripped into James and Engoron.\n\n“I think she’s a political hack,” Trump said of James, also labeling Engoron a “very hostile judge, extremely hostile judge.”\n\nTrump said he was especially upset with Engoron\'s pretrial finding that Trump had committed persistent fraud.\n\n“He ruled against me and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me,” Trump said of Engoron, who has overseen legal disputes between Trump and the attorney general’s office for years.\n\nA spat over Mar-a-Lago\n\nOut of all the fraud claims lodged by the AG, the one that appeared to bother Trump the most was one involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe AG\'s office noted that Trump valued Mar-a-Lago at between $426 million and $612 million on his financial statements between 2011 and 2021. The Palm Beach County Assessor, meanwhile, appraised the property\'s market value to be between $18 million and $27 million in the same time period. The AG\'s office also noted the financial statements valued the property as a private home, while Trump had signed an agreement with the county that it could only be used as a social club.\n\nTrump repeatedly complained about the AG citing the tax valuation and Engoron\'s pretrial finding that not disclosing the club restriction was fraudulent. “The judge had it at $18 million. And it is worth, say, I say from 50 to 100 times more than that. So I don’t know how you got those numbers,” Trump testified, adding later that he thinks it\'s actually worth ""between a billion and a billion five.” He\'s also complained about the valuation to reporters in court on the days he\'s attended the trial, at political rallies and on his Truth Social website.\n\nThe second to last defense witness in the case, Palm Beach real estate broker Lawrence Moens, brought a video he shot of the property with him that he played during his testimony. He said he valued the property at over $1 billion, and invited the AG to tour the property in person. ""I’ll make sure he is not there when you come,"" he said, referring to Trump.\n\nTrump was slapped with a gag order, and penalized for defying it\n\nTrump attended several days of the trial, and some of his comments to reporters during breaks came back to bite him. On the second day of trial, Trump referred reporters to a post on his social media platform Truth Social, where he shared the identity of the judge\'s law clerk and falsely accused her of having a personal relationship with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n“You saw what was just put out about Schumer and the principal clerk? That is disgraceful,” Trump said. The judge ordered the post be removed and issued a gag order barring Trump from talking about his court staff, saying such attacks ""are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won’t tolerate it."" He later fined Trump $5,000 after it was revealed the post was still on a campaign website weeks later and threatened further sanctions, including jail time.\n\nThe judge later expanded the gag order to include Trump\'s lawyers as well. Trump’s attorneys are appealing the gag orders and the fines against their client.\n\nTrump storms out of the courtroom\n\nOn Oct. 25, Engoron fined Trump another $10,000 after finding he told reporters outside the courtroom that Engoron is “a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.”\n\nThe judge took that as a reference to his law clerk, who sits next to him and who Trump had alleged was politically biased against him. He ordered Trump to take the witness stand, and he testified he was referring to that day\'s witness, his former attorney turned outspoken critic Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump has publicly called Cohen all sorts of names since he turned against him, but ""partisan"" has not been one of his insults. The judge said he found Trump\'s testimony ""not credible"" and fined him. ""Don’t do it again, or it will be worse,” Engoron warned.\n\nA short time later, Trump stormed out of the courtroom- seeming to surprise his lawyers and his Secret Service agents.\n\nTrump reunited with an old friend-turned-foe\n\nMichael Cohen\'s testimony was the first time he\'d come face to face with his former boss in five years. James has said she launched her investigation into Trump after Cohen testified about his business practices to the House Oversight Committee on Capitol Hill in 2019.\n\nTrump came to court for Cohen\'s testimony and appeared to be enjoying himself while his attorney Alina Habba got Cohen to acknowledge he\'d lied under oath in a previous court case. Cohen, who said he was involved in preparing some of the financial statements, also said Trump never directly told him to inflate values. Trump used that statement to declare victory in the case to reporters and his lawyers asked the judge to rule in the case in their favor.\n\nUnder further questioning from the AG, Cohen testified it wasn\'t Trump\'s style to make direct requests. He compared Trump to a “mob boss” who tells you what he wants without directly telling you.\n\nFormer accountant blames the Trumps\n\nThe AG\'s first witness was the Trump\'s former accountant, Donald Bender. Bender testified that he compiled the financial statements, called statements of financial condition, using information and valuations provided to him by executives at Trump\'s company, the Trump Organization. He said he relied on company officials, including former CFO Allen Weisselberg and senior vice president Jeff McConney, to provide him with accurate information. Asked at one point if he\'d subsequently learned the company had been holding information back from him, Bender said, “Yes.” He said that they’d failed to turn over “paper documents over a number of years.”\n\nWeisselberg and McConney testified as well. All three had also testified in the Manhattan district attorney\'s criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization last year. The company was convicted and fined and Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to falsifying business records, was sentenced to five months in jail.\n\nTrump family blames the accountants\n\nThe former president, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Weisselberg and other company officials all pointed a finger back at Bender and their other accountants during their testimony.\n\n""All I did is authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do a statement. In other words, we supplied them with what they needed. And if they didn\'t get it, they wouldn\'t do the statement,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump Jr., who\'s now running the company with his brother, said “I rely on the accountants” for the statements. “They were intimately involved in every aspect” of the statements, he said.\n\nEric Trump said, “I relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.” He also suggested the statements weren\'t the type of thing he paid much attention to. “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don’t focus on appraisals,” he said.\n\nIvanka Trump, a former executive at the company, also testified during the AG\'s case and said she was not involved with the statements, but assumed they were documents that ""he would work on with his own accountants.""\n\nTrump accounting expert says \'no evidence\' of fraud\n\nThe final defense witness was Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at NYU. Bartov, who was paid almost $900,000 for his work on the case by Trump\'s company and his political action committee, testified that “my analysis shows the statements of financial condition for all the years were not materially misstated.”\n\n“My main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud,” he said.\n\nThe judge asked him whether his expert opinion from an accounting perspective was that the AG’s claims had no merit. “Absolutely,” he replied.\n\nTrump, who attended the trial on the first day of Bartov\'s testimony, called Bartov “a very strong witness, a very powerful witness and a highly respected person.”\n\nA fond farewell\n\nAt the start of the last day of testimony Wednesday, Engoron said, “In a strange way. I am going to miss this trial. It has been an experience.”'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/who-are-the-key-players-in-the-jan-6-committee-hearings-so-far', 'Headline': 'Who are the witnesses testifying at the Jan. 6 hearings?', 'Snippet': 'But the committee has also called a number of new witnesses to offer key details about the timeline of events that day, as well as Trump’s actions in the weeks before it.

Here’s how to watch them\n\nIn the days ahead, advisers to then-Vice President Mike Pence and other former administrative staff may also appear to offer their accounts. Some have already participated in closed-door conversations with the committee; others have been subpoenaed for interviews or records.\n\nHere’s a guide to some of the key people who may testify or be discussed heavily throughout the course of the hearings.\n\nWitnesses and Key Players:\n\nMatthew Pottinger\n\nSarah Matthews\n\nStephen Ayres\n\nJason Van Tatenhove\n\nPat Cipollone\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nJeffrey Rosen\n\nRichard Donoghue\n\nSteven Engel\n\nRep. Russell “Rusty” Bowers\n\nWandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss\n\nBrad Raffensperger\n\nGabriel Sterling\n\nGinni Thomas\n\nGreg Jacob\n\nJ.

Pottinger was part of a wave of resignations from the Trump White House in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack. Pottinger was hired early into the administration and had stayed on through all four years.\n\nPottinger was also in the White House during much of the afternoon of Jan. 6, and, according to his testimony, tried to convince chief of staff Mark Meadows that Trump needed to diffuse the crowd.\n\nThe New York Times also reported ahead of the July 21 hearing that Pottinger told the committee about requests by Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to deploy the National Guard.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Pottinger has voluntarily appeared before the committee and some of his testimony has already appeared as video during previous hearings.\n\nThe latest: Pottinger testified alongside former deputy press secretary for Trump, Sarah Matthews during the July 21 public hearing.\n\nIn his testimony, he said that he decided to resign from the administration, where he’d worked since the beginning of Trump’s term, when he saw the president’s 2:24 p.m. tweet deriding Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAn aide handed him a sheet of paper with Trump’s tweet on it, Pottinger testified. It “disturbed” him that Trump was attacking Pence for carrying out his constitutional duty in overseeing the certification of Biden’s presidential victory, he said.\n\n“I simply didn’t want to be associated with the events that were unfolding at the Capitol,” he said, adding that the tweet added “fuel to the fire.”\n\nPottinger testified that his boss, former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, asked him to stay in his role until O’Brien returned from a trip, which Pottinger did. He left the next morning.\n\nWhen asked how the insurrection impacted national security, Pottinger said that presidential transitions are always times of increased vulnerability.\n\nBut he also said it allowed countries like Russia, China and Iran to paint a picture of a faltering American democracy. And he said allies could similarly worry about the strength of America’s institutions.\n\n“I think it’s incumbent upon us to put their minds at ease, to put our own hearts at ease, by investigating what happened on the sixth and making sure that it never happens again,” he said.\n\nSarah Matthews\n\nRole: Matthews is a former deputy press secretary for Trump.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? Matthews was one of a handful of staff in the Trump White House who resigned in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe eighth public hearing of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack focused on Trump’s actions during the insurrection, including the 187 minutes, or just over three hours where the attacks were underway, but he did not dissuade rioters despite calls from allies, members of Congress and aides to do so.\n\nAt its third public hearing on June 16, the committee showed footage of Matthews testifying that tweet “felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire.”\n\nSince resigning, Matthews has been critical of Trump. On the one year anniversary of the attacks, Matthews tweeted that the Capitol riot was a “coup attempt” and said Trump “failed to meet the moment.”\n\nBut while she was in the administration, Matthews had previously defended the president’s actions. In June 2020, one week after Trump said the 2020 election would be “the most corrupt election in the history of our country,” while pointing to debunked election fraud claims, Matthews defended him, saying that “President Trump is highlighting that Democrats’ plan for mass mail-in system would lead to fraud.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Matthews testified before the committee on July 21 and has talked to the committee in private hearings as well.\n\nThe latest:\n\nDuring the July 21 hearing, Matthews testified that she, along with other staff in the West Wing on Jan. 6, asked people close to Trump to encourage him to condemn the violence that was underway at the Capitol.\n\nMatthews said she spoke to former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who later told her that Trump initially rejected using the word “peace” in any of his tweets until his daughter, Ivanka Trump, suggested the phrase “stay peaceful,” which he finally agreed to.\n\nWhen another colleague suggested Trump should not condemn the violence because it would hand a “win” to the media, Matthews gestured to a TV airing the insurrection and asked, “Does it look like we’re effing winning? Because I don’t think it does.”\n\nAnd when Matthews saw Trump’s tweet at 4:17 p.m., she said it struck her that he continued to push the lie that he won the 2020 election. Though she had a “small sense of relief” when Trump told the rioters to go home, she was disappointed that he didn’t distinguish between the peaceful protesters who attended his rally and the violent insurrectionists that attacked the Capitol.\n\nAs part of the White House press team, “I knew that I would be asked to defend that. And to me, his refusal to act and call off the mob that day and his refusal to condemn the violence was indefensible. And so I knew that I would be resigning that evening,” Matthews testified.\n\nA later tweet by Trump at 6:01 p.m. “further cemented” that decision, she said. Matthews said she believed Trump needed to commit to an orderly transition of power, something he didn’t do until a tweet the following day. Instead, he tweeted:\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”\n\n“I thought that Jan. 6, 2021 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history and President Trump was treating it as a celebratory occasion with that tweet,” Matthews said.\n\nStephen Ayres\n\nRole: Stephen Ayres was a Trump supporter who attended the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally and ensuing riot at the Capitol. He has pleaded guilty to entering the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Ayres had been an avid Trump supporter who repeated the former president’s social media calls to action ahead of Jan. 6. Ayers shared one of Trump’s tweets telling supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6.\n\n“Where will you be on January 6th?” Ayers wrote on Facebook according to a government affidavit and arrest warrant. He added “are you willing to start fighting for the American Dream[?]”\n\nThe committee’s July 12 hearing focused on the role of extremism among far-right groups that went to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee also presented evidence about the ways that a Dec. 19, 2020 tweet from president Trump to participate in the Jan. 6 protest “was a siren call to these folks,” according to committee member, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Ayres voluntarily testified to the committee, the committee’s chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said during the seventh public hearing on July 12.\n\nThe latest: During his testimony, Ayres recounted how he was swept up in Trump’s false claims of voter fraud, and believed the election was stolen, in part because he followed the former president on several social media accounts.\n\nAyres described himself as an American “family man” who worked at a cabinet company in northeast Ohio and enjoyed playing basketball and camping with his family. Ayres represented the many unaffiliated Trump supporters who went to protest on Jan. 6, committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said on July 12.\n\nAyres attended the “Stop the Steal” rally Jan. 6, but had no intention of going to or entering the Capitol until Trump instructed his followers to march to the building.\n\n“Basically, the president got everyone riled up, told everyone to head on down, so we were following what he said,” Ayres said. As the attack on the Capitol began and members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence were forced into secure locations amid the insurrection, Trump initially refused to condemn the rioters. Ayres said that when Trump finally asked the rioters to leave, they did so. He believes that if Trump had asked the rioters to leave the Capitol earlier in the attack, people would have likely left.\n\nSince then, Ayres testified, he’s stopped believing the election was stolen. He lost his job, had to sell his home and pleaded guilty to disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds. He testified that following Trump’s call on Jan. 6 changed his life “not for the good, not for the better.”\n\n“I was hanging on every word [Trump] was saying. Everything he was putting out I was following it. I mean, if I was doing it, hundreds of thousands or millions of other people were doing it. Or maybe even still doing it,” Ayres said.\n\nJason Van Tatenhove\n\nRole: Van Tatenhove is the former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers, a far-right paramilitary organization.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? The committee’s seventh public hearing on July 12 focused on the days leading up to Jan. 6, including a December tweet Trump sent calling for his supporters to come to a rally on that day, and how his supporters were galvanized by this call.\n\nVan Tatenhove handled the media operations for the Oath Keepers’ for about two years, starting in 2014. He told Denver’s Fox 31 he was not connected to the group at the time of the attack on the Capitol. He said he’s since “purged” his connections to extremism.\n\nThe Oath Keepers is “one of the largest far-right antigovernment groups” in the U.S., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Recruitment efforts target ex-military and law enforcement officers, and members have participated in armed standoffs and violent protests, the SPLC said.\n\nIn January, the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, and 10 members were charged with seditious conspiracy for attempting to overthrow the government on Jan. 6. Rhodes has pleaded not guilty. According to the Jan. 6 committee, Rhodes on Election Day told members to “stock up on ammo” and prepare for a “full-on war in the streets,” if Trump didn’t win the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn his testimony, Van Tatenhove said that Rhodes is critical to the organization and that the Oath Keepers are “largely Stewart Rhodes.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Van Tatenhove testified on July 12 that despite wanting to portray themselves otherwise, the Oath Keepers are a violent militia who used military tactics as they attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n“The best illustration for what the Oath Keepers are happened Jan. 6 when we saw that stacked military formation going up the stairs of the Capitol,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nHe left the group after he overheard some members denying the Holocaust, he testified on July 12, though he said he probably should have left sooner.\n\nMuch of Van Tatenhove’s testimony focused on Rhodes who, according to Van Tatenhove, sees himself as a paramilitary leader.\n\nHe said that in the lead up to Jan. 6, Rhodes wanted Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers the president to call up militias to tamp down rebellions, because Rhodes believed this would grant him and the Oath Keepers “legitimacy” as a paramilitary organization.\n\n“[Rhodes] is a militia leader. He had these grand visions of being a paramilitary leader,” Van Tatenhove said. “And the Insurrection Act would have given him a path forward with that. The fact the president was communicating, whether directly or indirectly messaging, that gave him the nod. All I can do is thank the gods that things did not go any worse that day.”\n\nTatenhove said he believes Jan. 6 could have been more violent and that the country must reckon with the fact that such a threat still exists.\n\n“I think we need to quit mincing words and just talk about truths, and what it was going to be was an armed revolution. I mean, people died that day. Law enforcement officers died that day. There was a gallows set up in front of the Capitol. This could have been the spark that started a new civil war and no one would have won there,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nHe is also worried what Trump might do if he runs for reelection again and if the people who orchestrated the Jan. 6 attack are not held responsible.\n\n“I have three daughters. I have a granddaughter. I fear for the world that they will inherit if we do not start holding these people to account,” Van Tatenhove said.\n\nRhodes has also offered to testify to the Jan. 6 committee if he can do so live and in-person, instead of from jail, where he is awaiting trial. The committee has not responded to his request.\n\nPat Cipollone\n\nRole: Cipollone was White House counsel during the last two years of the Trump presidency, including in the aftermath of the 2020 election and run-up to the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As White House counsel, Cipollone was the Trump administration’s top lawyer. He was present for key meetings in which Trump and some of his allies discussed strategies to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election, according to his testimony at the seventh public House hearing on July 12.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Cipollone was subpoenaed June 29 by the Jan. 6 Committee and testified on July 8 for a private, on-camera interview.\n\nThe latest: At the Jan. 6 committee’s July 12 hearing, the committee showed clips of Cipollone’s recorded testimony in which he described internal disagreements over how to handle baseless claims of voter fraud and the role of extremist groups in helping perpetuate those claims.\n\nCipollone condemned the actions of Trump’s former lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who both promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud. In particular, Cipollone said he fruitlessly asked Powell for evidence that as she claims, voting machines had been hacked or votes had been changed.\n\n“At some point, you have to put up or shut up,” Cipollone said during the July 12 hearing.\n\nPowell and Giuliani also pushed for the federal government to seize voting machines, which Cipollone said was a “terrible idea” without basis in law.\n\n“That’s not how we do things in the United States. There’s no legal authority to do that and there is a way to contest elections, that happens all the time, but the idea that the federal government could come in and seize election machines?” Cipollone said.\n\n“It’s a terrible idea.”\n\nCipollone said he also opposed a plan to appoint Powell as a special counsel to investigate the false voting machine claims and was present during a heated meeting that lasted multiple hours in the White House with Trump involving Powell, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and others.\n\nAfter the meeting, the committee said, Trump tweeted “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”\n\nBetween that meeting and Jan. 6, Cipollone continued to dispute the voter fraud narrative, and supported the fact that Vice President Mike Pence had no legal authority to stop the count of electoral votes on Jan. 6, he said.\n\nIn an informal interview on April 13, Cipollone gave a statement to the Jan. 6 Committee indicating he had initially stopped Department of Justice lawyer Jeffrey Clark, who had been proposing ways to further Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud, from meeting with the president.\n\nClark went on to communicate with the president about his ideas, and in one meeting, Trump discussed the possibility of Clark replacing acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who refused to overturn the 2020 election results, according to testimony from the hearings.\n\nFormer Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue and top Department of Justice official Steven Engel told the committee on June 23 that Cipollone also refused to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and shared the belief that Clark was not capable to lead the Department of Justice. He was supportive as top officials threatened to resign if Clark was named head of the department, they said\n\nAccording to Hutchinson’s testimony June 28, Cipollone told her on Jan. 3 that he was worried about the legal consequences if Trump went to the Capitol on Jan. 6. Cippollone warned her again on the morning of Jan. 6 as she was preparing to go to Trump’s rally on the Ellipse, she told the committee.\n\nAfter the rally, as rioters broke into the Capitol and disrupted the counting of electoral votes, Hutchinson said she witnessed an exchange between Cipollone and her immediate supervisor, Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in which Cipollone pushed Meadows to get Trump to do something to stop the violence.\n\nShe recalled Cipollone saying something to the effect of “Mark, something needs to be done, or people are going to die and the blood’s going to be on your effing hands,’” Hutchinson said in her testimony.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson\n\nRole: Hutchinson was an aide to former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? As an aide to the then-chief of staff, Hutchinson was privy to many conversations between the president and Meadows that happened before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and in the days that followed. She has already been interviewed by the committee and testimony from her taped interviews before the committee have been played out in previous hearings.\n\nHutchinson has reportedly sat for more than 20 hours of interviews with the committee. Some of her video testimony has been played out at previous hearings, including on June 23, when the committee shared a clip of her saying that she was involved in conversations about possible Jan.6 pardons with several lawmakers and staff, including Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Mo Brooks, R-Ala., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Louie Gohmert, R-Texas and Scott Perry R-Pa. A few of the lawmakers named said in statements following the hearings that they did not make such requests. In earlier video testimony, Hutchinson said Meadows and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani were involved in early efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential elections by plotting to put forward fake electors. The June 28 hearing would be the first time Hutchinson testifies before the committee in person.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes, Hutchinson testified June 28. Committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the committee received evidence that people had contacted Hutchinson ahead of the hearings attempting to interfere with her testimony, adding that it would consider how to handle that offense in the coming weeks.\n\nThe latest: Hutchinson offered new details during her June 28 testimony about what former President Donald Trump and Meadows knew in the days before the attack and how they responded while it was underway, including a first-hand account of the president’s frustration and an attack on security detail who told him they could not secure a trip to the Capitol amid the unfolding violence by rioters.\n\nHutchinson detailed a slow response from Meadows as details emerged about weapons and threats to the vice president, who was at the Capitol overseeing the counting of electoral votes, and Trump’s resistance in the aftermath to publicly acknowledge the violence of rioters, or that the election was over and that he had not won.\n\nShe told the committee that agency heads, White House staff, advisers and lawyers had expressed concern about Jan. 6 and the president’s participation in it. Much of that guidance reached the president itself, but the first line of defense was often Meadows, who was with the president throughout the election aftermath and the events of that day. In her role as senior adviser, Hutchinson accompanied Meadows almost everywhere, including alongside the president and in frequent trips to Capitol Hill and meetings with lawmakers, she said.\n\nSome highlights of her testimony:\n\nWarnings of violence on Jan. 6 to Trump and Meadows. Hutchinson recalled a meeting between Meadows and Tony Ornato, a White House deputy chief of staff tasked with security, around 10 a.m. on the morning of the attack, in which Ornato warned him of rally-goers with knives, guns, pistols and rifles, body armors spears and flag poles.Meadows was slow to react, Hutchinson said, but eventually asked if Ornato had informed the president, to which Ornato responded he had.\n\nLegal concerns. Several White House lawyers warned Trump against using certain language in his speech at the Ellipse, and against making a trip to the Capitol himself, Hutchinson said. Hutchinson recalled guidance from then-Trump legal adviser Eric Hershmann to not include calls to fight for Trump or march to the Capitol during his speech, both because of legal concerns and optics about what the president wanted people to do that day. She also said Hershmann warned against including specific references to then-Vice President Mike Pence. White House lawyer Pat Cipollone approached Hutchinson several times before Jan.6 with legal concerns. They’d “charged with every crime imaginable” if the trip happened,” Hutchinson recalled him saying, adding that in the days before the attack they’d had conversations about specific charges of obstruction of justice or defrauding the electoral count.\n\nThe Ellipse speech When they arrived at the rally, Trump was “furious” that the front area in front of the stage was not full, Hutchinson said. He was informed that people did not want to enter the space, which was being monitored by magnetometers, because they did not want their weapons confiscated. Trump repeatedly urged security to let them through, despite those security measures. “I don’t [f***ing] care that they have weapons,” Hutchinson recalled Trump saying, adding that they weren’t there to hurt him and to take the magnetometers away. “‘Let them in. Let my people in,’” Hutchinson recalled the president saying. “‘They can march to the Capitol from here.’”\n\nTrump’s attempts to go to the Capitol. Hutchinson said while at the Ellipse, it was becoming clear to Secret Service that Capitol Police were having problems controlling the perimeter of the Capitol and defending against rioters, especially as the crowd grew. Before and after the president’s speech, Hutchinson said she warned Meadows a Capitol trip was not possible, based on guidance from security. On the way to Trump’s vehicle afterward, Meadows told the president that the head of his detail, Bobby Engel, had more information about the trip to the Capitol, Hutchinson said. When Trump got into the car, Engel told him they didn’t have the assets for the trip and that it wasn’t secure. Trump became “irate,” Hutchinson said White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato recalled to her after she returned to the White House. Trump said something to the effect of, “I’m the effing president, take me up to the Capitol now,” Hutchinson recalled. After Engel relayed they had to return to the White House, Trump reached up to the front of the vehicle to grab the steering wheel. Engel grabbed the president’s arm and said “Sir, you need to let go,” Hutchinson recalled. Trump then used his free hand to lunge toward Engel’s neck, Ornato told Hutchinson.\n\nResponse to violence. Trumps’ lawyers, advisers and daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, all encouraged the president to have a stronger response to the violence the day after the attacks, Jan. 7. Though Trump eventually did make a statement that day, Hutchinson said she learned the president had resisted the idea of giving a speech, and objected to some of the language in the original draft, including any acknowledgement of prosecuting the rioters, calling them violent, or that “this election is now over.”Trump also wanted to put in a promise of pardons for the rioters, which those around him ultimately convinced him to omit, Hutchinson said.\n\n“As an American, I was disgusted,” Hutchinson said of Trump’s tweet about Pence on Jan. 6. “It was unpatriotic. It was un-American. We were watching the Capitol building get defaced over a lie,” she told the committee.\n\nA pardon request. Hutchinson testified that Meadows sought a pardon for his role on Jan. 6.\n\nMore on Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nRole: Clark was a high-ranking DOJ official in the Trump administration.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Clark was one of the few lawyers within the Department of Justice who was willing to act on Donald Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud and requests for help in overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, witnesses said during the committee’s June 23 hearing.\n\nFederal agents searched Clark’s Virginia home on June 22, a day before the fifth Jan. 6 committee hearing.\n\nIn a 2021 New York Times story on the alleged plan to fire Rosen, Clark denied being part of an effort to oust Rosen.\n\n“There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions,” Clark told the New York Times.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Clark was subpoenaed by the committee and agreed to be interviewed. However, that interview was cut short by Clark. In its June 23 hearing, the committee showed video of Clark invoking his 5th Amendment protections against self-incrimination at least twice.\n\nThe latest: Clark did not appear publicly at the fifth committee hearing, but most of the witness testimony focused on his actions in Trump’s final weeks in office.\n\nCheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., questioned former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, former Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue and former Assistant Attorney General Jeff Engel about Clark’s actions, especially his offers to help the president in efforts to overturn the election.\n\nRosen told the committee that Clark was violating department policy from the start by communicating with anyone at the White House, since typically only the attorney general or deputy attorney general does so. Rosen reprimanded Clark, one of his employees, for talking to Trump in a private meeting about the issue. Rosen said Clark was “contrite” and assured him he did not intend to meet with the president again.\n\nBut Clark discussed the election with Trump many more times, including drafting a letter to send to state legislatures saying the department had concerns about the election and instructing them to find an alternate slate of electors.\n\nWithin a week, Trump had told Clark he intended to have him replace Rosen as acting attorney general. At the committee hearing, Kinzinger showed the White House call logs on Jan. 3, noting that Clark was already being noted as “Acting Attorney General.”\n\nUltimately, in a two and a half hour meeting that evening, according to Rosen, Donoghue and Engel, Trump decided not to replace Rosen with Clark.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the president asked what was next for Clark, implying that Donoghue would fire him. When the deputy attorney general explained that only Trump had the power to fire Clark, Trump replied, “Well I’m not going to fire him,” Donoghue said.\n\n“All right, well, then we should all get back to work,” Donoghue recalled responding.\n\nJeffrey Rosen\n\nRole: Rosen was acting attorney general under Trump during the final days of his presidency, replacing Attorney General William Barr when Barr resigned in December 2020.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? After Trump lost the election, he pressured Department of Justice officials, including Rosen, to help him overturn the results. That included telling them, “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen,” according to a Senate Judiciary report.\n\nAnother Department of Justice lawyer, Jeffrey Clark, concocted a plan for the department to send letters to states Trump lost, instructing them to appoint an alternate slate of electors who would vote for Trump. Clark outlined the plan to Trump, who threatened to replace Rosen with Clark unless Rosen signed his name to the letters and sent them, according to the report.\n\nRosen refused to cooperate with the plan, according to the report.\n\nUltimately, Trump did not fire Rosen and the letters were never sent.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Rosen testified in the June 23 public hearing and in closed-door meetings with the committee. He has also cooperated with the Senate Judiciary investigation.\n\nThe latest: At the June 23 hearing, Rosen explained in great detail how the president repeatedly contacted him and other department officials with false claims of voter fraud, and how he regularly debunked those claims and explained their inauthenticity.\n\nBetween Rosen’s appointment as acting attorney general on Dec. 23, 2020, and Jan. 5 2021, Trump contacted him “virtually every day” expressing his “dissatisfaction” that the Justice Department hadn’t done enough to investigate voter fraud, Rosen testified.\n\nTrump asked him to appoint a special counsel to investigate election fraud, meet with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, file a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, make public statements or hold a press conference about election fraud, and send a letter to state legislatures, Rosen said.\n\n“I will say that the Justice Department declined all of those requests … because we did not think that they were appropriate based on the facts and the law as we understood them,” Rosen testified.\n\nRosen said that during every conversation, he explained that what Trump wanted was not part of the department’s purview. For a similar reason, Rosen said he refused to meet with Trump campaign officials, saying that would not be appropriate.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark had been meeting with the president and validating his false claims of fraud despite Rosen’s direct orders against this, Rosen testified. When Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue, refused to sign a letter Clark wanted to send to states, instructing them to find an alternate slate of electors, Clark told Rosen that Trump wanted to make Clark acting attorney general, replacing Rosen.\n\nAt the June 23 hearing, Rosen, who testified alongside Donoghue and Steven Engel, a former assistant attorney general, explained to the committee why he didn’t want Clark in his role.\n\n“It wasn’t about me. There’s only 17 days left in the administration. At that point, I would have been perfectly content to have either of the gentlemen on my left or right replace me if anybody wanted to do that,” Rosen said, gesturing to Engel and Donoghue. “But I did not want for the Department of Justice to be put in a posture where it would be doing things that were not consistent with the truth, were not consistent with its own appropriate role or were not consistent with the Constitution.”\n\nUltimately, Trump decided not to replace Rosen with Clark.\n\nOn the day of the Jan. 6 attack, Rosen said he spoke with various members of Congress, Vice President Mike Pence and members of his own department, but not Trump.\n\nRichard Donoghue\n\nRole: Donoghue was the acting deputy attorney general in the last year of Trump’s presidency.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Donoghue was among the Department of Justice officials who resisted pressure to validate Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nDuring the first day of testimony for the Jan. 6 Committee on June 10, Rep Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Donoghue was among the Department of Justice lawyers who had investigated but did not find evidence of Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. He was also among those who refused to use their positions to further the former president’s claims.\n\nTrump considered replacing acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen with another Department of Justice lawyer, Jeffrey Clark, who had been telling the president he could help him overturn the election results, according to the committee. Donoghue was among the Justice lawyers who threatened to resign if this happened.\n\nIn previously recorded testimony, Donoghue said Trump would ask about an election fraud claim, and after he debunked it, the president would then quickly move on to another claim.\n\nDonoghue said Trump’s claims included Native Americans “being paid to vote,” voting errors in Michigan, truckloads of ballots being shipped from New York to Pennsylvania and “suitcases” of votes being dumped in Georgia. Donoghue said he gave explanations to Trump that debunked all those allegations.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Donoghue testified in the committee’s June 23 hearing, alongside former acting attorney Jeffrey Rosen and Steven Engel, a former assistant attorney general.\n\nThe latest: At the committee’s Jun. 23 hearing, Donoghue offered more detail on how the former president tried to pressure Justice Department officials to help him overturn the results of the election.\n\nDonoghue said Trump contacted him repeatedly in December 2020. The requests “became more urgent,” as Trump became “more adamant” that officials should investigate his false claims of voter fraud.\n\nDonoghue testified that he explained to Trump why each of his claims had been debunked, and that the Justice Department wouldn’t file a lawsuit on behalf of the American people, because the department’s only client is the U.S. government.\n\n“We simply did not have standing,” Donoghue said. “We tried to explain that to the president on numerous occasions.”\n\nDonoghue also took contemporaneous notes during his phone calls with Rosen and Trump, and the committee regularly referred back to them.\n\nAccording to one of his notes, Rosen told Trump that the Justice Department “can’t and won’t snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election.”\n\nIn response, Trump said, “That’s not what I’m asking you to do. What I’m asking you to do is just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” Donoghue testified.\n\nWhen Donoghue received an email from Clark outlining his proposed letter asking states to send new slates of electors to support Trump, he said he felt he needed to respond immediately to discredit the idea because it was “so extreme.”\n\nEventually, Donoghue, Rosen, Clark and others met with the president Jan. 3 to discuss Trump’s idea to replace Rosen with Clark as acting attorney general.\n\nDonghue was vehemently against the idea, he testified.\n\n“Mr. President, you should have the leadership that you want but understand the United States Justice Department functions on facts, evidence and law,” Donoghue said he told Trump. “And those are not going to change. So you can have whatever leadership you want, but the department’s position is not going to change.”\n\nTrump ultimately decided not to fire Rosen.\n\nSteven Engel\n\nRole: Engel served as assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during the Trump administration.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Engel and other senior Justice Department officials threatened to resign if Trump fired acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and named DOJ lawyer Jeffrey Clark to the top job days before the Electoral College votes would be counted at the U.S. Capitol, he testified to the committee. . If installed, Clark, who was in charge of the Justice Department’s civil division at the time, planned to use his new position to help change the results of the 2020 election.\n\nEngel was also part of a White House meeting on Jan. 3, 2021 in which he and other senior Justice Department officials told Trump they would all resign if Clark replaced Rosen. Trump decided not to fire Rosen.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: In Jun. 23 testimony, Engel testified alongside Rosen and Donoghue about Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to help overturn the election.\n\nHe explained how Clark’s communication with Trump violated long-held department policy of only the attorney general or deputy attorney general speaking with the White House.\n\n“It’s critical that the Department of Justice conducts its criminal investigations free from either the reality, or any appearance, of political interference,” Engel testified. “People can get in trouble if people at the White House are speaking with people at the department, and that’s why the purpose of these policies is to keep these communications as infrequent and at the highest levels as possible.”\n\nEngel was also present for a Jan. 3 meeting with Trump, Rosen and former acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, where the president debated replacing Rosen as acting attorney general with Clark.\n\nThe conversation lasted for more than two hours, according to their testimony, and Engel was among those trying to convince Trump not to replace Rosen.\n\n“My recollection is that when the president turned to me and said, ‘Steve, you wouldn’t leave, would you?’ I said, ‘Mr. President, I have been with you through four attorneys general, including two acting attorneys general. But I couldn’t be part of this,’” Engel testified.\n\nHe also told Trump that Clark’s letter would not be the bombshell he’d hoped, but would instead result in a public narrative of the president having fired two attorneys general to find the one who would do his bidding.\n\n“It’s going to be the disaster of Jeff Clark,” Engel said, recalling that White House lawyer Pat Cipollone agreed, calling it a “murder-suicide pact.”\n\nRep. Russell “Rusty” Bowers\n\nRole: Bowers is a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives, where he also serves as speaker.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Bowers was one of several state-level Republican lawmakers who supported Trump’s re-election campaign in 2020. After Trump’s loss, Bowers defended the election results in his state, where President Joe Biden came out on top.\n\nIn May, Bowers was one of five people to receive this year’s John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, given to public officials who protect U.S. democracy.\n\n“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said, according to the awards page. “I voted for President Trump and worked hard to reelect him. But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Bowers was the first witness to testify before the Jan. 6 Committee during its June 21 hearing. He described getting phone calls from Trump and Giuliani, who made allegations of voter fraud and asked him to convene a special hearing of the legislature to consider the allegations. Bowers told the committee he refused because he did not believe evidence of election fraud was sufficient. They also suggested that Arizona law would allow Bowers to remove Biden’s electors and recognize electors for Trump.\n\n“And I said, ‘That’s totally new to me. I’ve never heard of any such thing,’” Bowers told the committee.\n\nBowers told Trump and Giuliani that this was not possible and that taking action based on hearsay evidence would be a violation of his oath of office.\n\n“I said, ‘Look, you are asking me to do something that is counter to my oath, when I swore to the Constitution to uphold it. And I also swore to the Constitution and the laws of the state of Arizona, and this is totally foreign as an idea or a theory to me. You are asking me to do something against my oath and I will not break my oath,’” Bowers testified.\n\nBowers also testified that Giuliani expected him to be more receptive to his claims of voter fraud because they were both Republicans.\n\n“He would say, “Aren’t we all Republicans? I would think we would get a better reception — that you would listen to my suggestions,’” Bowers said.\n\nDespite Bowers’ refusal to participate in what the former president suggested, lawmakers in the state pursued other efforts. Arizona’s Senate went on to authorize a recount of presidential and U.S. Senate results from Maricopa County, a process that has been a consistent source of misinformation about the election, including from the conservative firm hired to analyze results. Independent fact checkers and election analysts have dubbed the firm’s methods deeply flawed. The report confirmed Biden’s win and found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nAlong with blocking the request from Trump and Giuliani, Bowers also intervened in January 2022 to stop a House bill that would have given the state legislature power to choose its slate of presidential electors, overriding the winner chosen by voters.\n\nWandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss\n\nRole: Wandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss was an elections worker in Georgia during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? In targeting Georgia with baseless claims of voter fraud, former President Donald Trump and his allies accused Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, of being behind fake ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, where they served as election workers.\n\nAfter the election, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies of the former president repeatedly promoted the false conspiracy theory that election workers in the county tampered with the vote count to tilt the race toward Joe Biden. They pointed to a video posted by a conservative PAC that purported to show election workers packing ballots into “suitcases.” As reported by USA Today and other fact checkers, election workers were packing absentee ballots into storage containers, a routine practice, because they thought the day’s counting was done. The video was played by conservative media outlets and also included in a lawsuit from Trump alleging voter fraud in Georgia. Giuliani also alleged that Freeman handed Moss a USB drive during her election work. Moss testified on June 21 that it was actually a ginger candy.\n\nMoss was one of five recipients for this year’s John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, given to public officials who protect U.S. democracy. Moss was honored for “doing the hard and unseen work to run our democracy.”\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Moss testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Moss said during her testimony June 21 that she became an election worker because her family had throughout her life stressed the importance of voting, a right that her grandmother often pointed out was not available to generations before her. She loved helping connect people to the process, she said.\n\nShe discovered her name had been used by Trump and his allies when election officials called her into their office, saying they’d received threats and asking if she had been targeted. In her Facebook Messenger app, she found dozens of threats and death threats, many of them racist in nature.\n\nBoth Moss and her mother, along with her grandmother, were targeted by death threats, she testified before the committee. At the suggestion of the FBI, Freeman said she left her home for about two months for her safety, through the events of Jan. 6 and the inauguration.\n\nIn video testimony played by the committee, Freeman said she doesn’t introduce herself by name anymore and gets worried when she gives her name for food orders or at the grocery store.\n\n“I’ve lost my name and I’ve lost my reputation. I’ve lost my sense of security all because a group of people people starting with Number 45 and his ally Rudy Giuliani decided to scapegoat me and my daughter, Shaye, to push their own lies about how the presidential election was stolen,” Freeman said. “There is nowhere I feel safe, nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one. He targeted me, lady ruby, a small business owner, mother, proud American citizen. Stood up to help Fulton county run an election in the middle of the pandemic.”\n\nMoss said she “felt horrible for picking this job and being the one that always wants to help, always there, never missing one election. I felt like it was my fault putting my family in the situation.”\n\nThe experience “turned my life upside down. I no longer give out my business card. I don’t transfer calls. I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” she added. “ I second-guess everything that I do. It has affected my life in a major way.”\n\nMoss and her mother have since filed defamation lawsuits against Giuliani and other media outlets who spread misinformation with the video. One of them, against One America News network, was settled in April, AJC reported.\n\nWhen asked by Schiff how many workers remained in their jobs after the 2020 election, Moss responded that no permanent election worker or supervisor was still at their jobs — including her.\n\nBrad Raffensperger\n\nRole: Raffensperger is Georgia’s secretary of state.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As the top official responsible for elections in Georgia, Raffensperger was responsible for managing the 2020 election in the state, which Biden won by a thin margin. In the months following the election, Raffensperger would come under pressure from Trump to change the outcome of the election, including being told to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s victory.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Raffensperger testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Raffensperger opened his testimony before the Jan. 6 Committee on June 21 by saying he believed the Georgia election went “remarkably smooth,” while the aftermath was anything but.\n\nWith Trump losing by a narrow margin, he asked for a recount in Georgia, which he also lost. He then began making baseless allegations of voter fraud.\n\nRaffensperger said his office did “nearly 300” investigations into voter fraud but did not find evidence of substantial ballot tampering.\n\n“They said there was over 66,000 underage voters. We found there is zero…They said there were 2,000 non registered voters. There were zero. They said there were over 2,056 felons, we identified 74 or less,” Raffensperger said of his efforts to look into baseless allegations made by Trump and his allies.\n\n“Every single allegation we checked. We ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate.”\n\nRaffensperger also testified about how as part of the pressure campaign following the election, Trump called him to “find” 11,780 votes to swing the election in his favor.\n\n“What I knew is we did not have any votes to find. We investigated. There were no votes to find. That was an accurate count that had been certified,” Raffensperger said.\n\nHis wife’s cell phone was also doxed and both of them got threats and pressure from strangers. His son’s widow’s home was broken into. When asked why he didn’t quit, Raffensperger said he “had to be faithful to the constitution.”\n\nTrump continued the pressure.\n\nGabriel Sterling\n\nRole: Sterling is the chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Sterling is a top voting official in Georgia, and helped manage the 2020 presidential election and recount in Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost. As a result, Trump and his allies honed in on the state as an example of their false and unfounded claims of voter fraud.\n\nGeorgia both audited the vote tally and performed a recount of the votes because Biden’s lead was so razor thin. Sterling consistently said his office was taking claims of election law violations seriously, but ultimately the state found no widespread fraud.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Sterling testified June 21.\n\nThe latest: Sterling was the Georgia election official who, in response to Trump’s claims of voter fraud, held a news conference publicly denying the claims, describing the fear and harassment they had caused among blameless election workers and warned that “someone’s going to get killed” if the heated rhetoric over baseless election fraud claims continued.\n\nSterling described to the committee what he called the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” which was a tweet accusing a young contractor with the Dominion voting systems of treason, accompanied by an image of a swinging noose. Sterling was tasked with helping oversee the voting systems that were produced by Dominion Voting Systems, which became the focus of many unfounded conspiracy theories about voter fraud by Trump and his allies.\n\n“For lack of a better word I lost it. I just got irate,” Sterling said, adding that he then used a pre-scheduled press conference on that day to urge Trump to put an end to the fraudulent claims.\n\n“I lost my temper, but it seemed necessary at the time because it was just getting worse,” Sterling said.\n\nHowever, the allegations of election fraud continued. With a new claim that a video depicted Fulton County election workers using “suitcases” to add ballots for Biden to the vote count. Sterling said in an effort to look into the allegations, his office viewed 48 hours of video of the Fulton County count. No evidence of voter fraud was found.\n\n“What it actually showed was Fulton County election workers engaging in normal ballot processes,” Sterling said.\n\nSterling said despite his efforts to debunk claims of election fraud, Trump and his allies continued to make their claims, claims that were believed and repeated by his supporters.\n\n“It was frustrating. Oftentimes I felt our information was getting out, but there was a reticence of people who needed to believe it, to believe it because the president of the United States, who many looked up to and respected, was telling them it wasn’t true despite the facts. I have characterized at some point it was like a shovel trying to empty the ocean with a shovel,” Sterling testified.\n\nLast week, Sterling testified before a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia about Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state.\n\nVirginia ‘Ginni’ Thomas\n\nRole: Thomas is a conservative activist, attorney and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? The House panel obtained emails between Ginni Thomas and John Eastman, who was an adviser to former President Donald Trump and a former Supreme Court clerk for Clarence Thomas, the Washington Post reported, citing people “involved in the committee’s investigation.” Eastman was part of the effort to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to block electors and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Post previously reported that Thomas emailed Arizona state lawmakers, asking them to “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure” and “take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen.” Thomas also messaged with Mark Meadows, who was the White House chief of staff at the time, about efforts to overturn the election results, according to reporting by the Post and CBS News.\n\nCooperated with the committee? House Jan. 6 Committee Chair Bennie Thompson said after the June 16 hearing that they have sent an invitation to Ginni Thomas to speak with the committee.\n\nPrior to the invitation, Thomas told The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet, that she “can’t wait to clear up misconceptions. I look forward to talking to them.”\n\nThe latest: Thompson told reporters after Thursday’s hearing that “we have sent Ms. Thomas a letter” inviting her to speak with them.\n\nGreg Jacob\n\nRole: Jacob was the chief counsel to former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As a top advisor to Pence, Jacob was part of the effort to rebut legal arguments given to, and later cited by, Trump, that the vice president could change the way Electoral College votes were counted, thereby changing the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nJacob disputed a memo from John Eastman, a lawyer affiliated with the conservative Claremont Institute, who argued Pence could refuse to accept the electoral votes from certain states and described the vice president as the “ultimate arbiter” of how the electoral votes would be counted.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. He has given statements to the Jan. 6 committee and testified publicly on June 16, along with conservative former Judge J. Michael Luttig.\n\nThe latest: The bulk of the June 16 hearing focused on Jacob’s testimony, which outlined the steps Eastman and Trump took in the days leading up to the insurrection to keep the president in power.\n\nJacob testified that Pence first asked him about the legality of rejecting electors in early December of 2020. According to Jacob, Pence could not believe it would be legal, so Jacob drafted a memo explaining it was not.\n\n“The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way our framers who abhorred concentrated power, who had broken away from the tyranny of George III, would have ever put one person, particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election, in a role to have decisive impact on the outcome of the election,” Jacob said.\n\n“Our review of text, history, and frankly just common sense all confirmed the vice president’s first instinct on that point. There is no justifiable basis to conclude the vice president has that kind of authority,” Jacob testified.\n\nOn Jan 4. and Jan. 5, Jacob had several conversations with Eastman, as well as Trump and Pence chief of staff Marc Short, in which Eastman pushed the theory that Pence could either reject electors outright or delay certification for 10 days, giving state legislatures time to send Trump-friendly electors for a later vote count. Jacob was not swayed and worked to convince Eastman that his suggestions weren’t constitutional.\n\n“The vice president never budged from the position that I have described as his first instinct,” Jacob testified.\n\nThe morning of Jan. 6, as Jacob and others polished Pence’s statement that he could not overturn the results of the election, Jacob said Pence received a phone call from the president. Though Pence stepped out to take it, the committee played testimony from others who heard Trump’s side of the call, including the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump. They described it as heated, and said Trump used vulgar language to describe Pence.\n\nJacob also detailed Pence’s actions on Jan. 6, noting that the vice president was taken to a secure location as rioters stormed the building but never left the Capitol.\n\n“The vice president did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the U.S. Capitol. He was determined that we would complete the work that we had set out to do that day, that it was his constitutional duty to see it through,” Jacob said.\n\nJacob also said that Pence and his wife were frustrated that Trump never checked on their safety during the riot. And he testified that while they waited in the secure location, he read his Bible, relying on his faith to sustain him.\n\n“Daniel 6 was where I went. And in Daniel 6, Daniel has become the second in command of Babylon, a pagan nation, that he completely, faithfully serves. He refuses an order from the King that he cannot follow, and he does his duty consistent with his oath to God,” Jacob tesfied.\n\n“And I felt that that’s what had played out that day.”\n\nJ. Michael Luttig\n\nRole: Luttig is a former federal judge and conservative legal expert who advised former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Luttig played a key role in supporting Pence as the former vice president refused requests from Trump, under the advice of conservative Claremont Institute lawyer John Eastman, to reject the results of the 2020 elections, CNN has reported.\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Eastman reportedly told Trump that Pence could simply refuse to certify the electors sent by the states, thus throwing the selection of electoral votes to House of Representative state delegations that were dominated by Republicans who supported Trump.\n\n“The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind,” Eastman wrote in the memo.\n\nAccording to CNN, Pence’s personal lawyer, Richard Cullen, contacted Luttig asking him to provide a legal argument to rebut Eastman, who had once been Luttig’s clerk.\n\nLuttig published a Tweet thread the day before the insurrection on whether Pence as vice president had the ability to change the way Electoral College votes were counted. Luttig concluded that Pence did not.\n\n“The only responsibility and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to faithfully count the electoral college votes as they have been cast,” Luttig wrote.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. Luttig was one of two witnesses in the committee’s June 16 hearing.\n\nThe latest: In his testimony at the June 16 hearing, Luttig explained that in his opinion, the theory that the vice president had any power in overturning the result of the election during Congress’ official count of electoral votes was not only wrong, but also dangerous.\n\n“The declaration of Donald Trump as the next president would have plunged America into what I believe would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis in America,” Luttig told the committee.\n\nHe described in thorough detail the constitutional basis for the vice president counting the electoral votes on Jan. 6, and said that in his view, the text is “pristine clear.”\n\n“There was no basis in the constitution or laws of the United States at all for the theory espoused by Mr. Eastman. At all. None,” Luttig said.\n\nHe also said that on Jan. 6, the vice president had “little substantive constitutional authority, if any at all” over Congress’ proceedings.\n\nAccording to testimony by Luttig and others, Eastman argued that earlier vice presidents had taken action similar to what Eastman was proposing.\n\nBut Luttig rebuffed the idea that there has been any historical precedent for the vice president rejecting electoral votes, calling that theory the “root of what I have called the blueprint to overturn the 2020 election.”\n\n“I would have laid my body across the road before I would have let the vice president overturn the 2020 election on the basis of that historical precedent,” he said.\n\nIn his final statement, Luttig said he believes Trump and his supporters are a “clear and present danger to American democracy.”\n\nHe said he’s worried that Trump or his “anointed successor” would try to overturn the results of the 2024 election should they not win.\n\n“I do not speak these words lightly. I would have never spoken these words ever in my life, except that’s what the former president and his allies are telling us,” he said.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nRole: Eastman was a legal advisor for Trump and a founding director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, a law firm that is part of the conservative think tank The Claremont Institute. He also previously clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Eastman was critical to perpetuating the myth that there were legal pathways to overturn the 2020 election. In December, he filed a brief on Trump’s behalf in a Texas lawsuit challenging Biden’s win before the Supreme Court. The court threw the case out, but Eastman kept up his efforts, including circulating a series of memos espousing the theory that the vice president is “the ultimate arbiter” of the election and had the power to delay Congress’ count of Electoral College votes.\n\nIn the days leading up to Jan. 6, he tried to convince Pence and his lawyer Greg Jacob of his legal theory, and spoke alongside Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani at Trump’s Jan. 6 rally before rioters headed toward the Capitol.\n\nCooperated with the committee? The committee subpoenaed Eastman, and he testified in closed-door interviews. However, he invoked 5th Amendment protections against self-incrimination for 100 questions, committee Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said at the June 16 hearing.\n\nHe also initially refused to turn over a trove of documents the committee requested. He released them after a judge ordered him to do so.\n\nThe latest: During the June 16 hearing, Jacob and retired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig repeatedly dismantled Eastman’s theory that the vice president has the Constitutional authority to reject states’ slates of electors or delay the certification of votes at all.\n\nJacob explained that in the days leading up to Jan. 6, Eastman presented two paths for how Pence could keep Trump in power. He could outright reject the electors and their votes or he could delay the certification for 10 days, which would give state legislatures time to send Trump-friendly electors for a later vote count.\n\nBoth Jacob and Luttig testified before the committee that both avenues were illegal, and Jacob said Pence never considered either option. Aguilar also showed an October memo in which Eastman himself noted that those pathways were not legal.\n\nJacob testified that Eastman switched back and forth over which route he recommended, noting that the second might be more “politically palatable,” and insisted the 10 days would be time to get public acceptance for the move.\n\nDespite Pence never entertaining Eastman’s suggestions, Eastman pushed the issue numerous times up through Jan. 6. After the insurrection, which delayed the count beyond what is technically called for in the Electoral Count Act, Eastman tried at least once more to convince the vice president to delay the certification.\n\n“Now that we have established that the Electoral Count Act is not so sacrosanct as you have made it out to be, I implore you to consider one more relatively minor violation and adjourn for 10 days to allow the legislatures to finish their investigations,” he emailed Pence.\n\nDays later, Eastman emailed Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani asking to be placed on a potential presidential pardon list, the committee revealed, though he ultimately was not.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Eastman had exchanged emails about tactics to overturn the election with conservative activist Ginni Thomas, who is also the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nBJay Pak\n\nRole: Pak is the former U.S. Attorney General for the Northern District of Georgia\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Georgia, where Pak was U.S. Attorney General, was one of the states in which the Trump campaign falsely claimed it saw substantial voter fraud.\n\nThe committee first spoke to Pak in August. CNN reported that as part of his testimony, Pak said he stepped down as U.S. Attorney in Atlanta after Trump called Georgia’s secretary of state and tried to pressure him into saying there had been election fraud.\n\nDuring that call, Trump referred to a “never-Trump” official, though he didn’t specifically say Pak’s name.\n\nAfter Pak resigned, Trump appointed a new U.S. Attorney, and Pak said he had confidence in his successor.\n\nAccording to a Senate Judiciary Committee interim staff report, “Pak’s office had investigated and debunked various allegations of election fraud in Georgia” by the time Trump called. The report alleges that Pak had planned to stay in his role until inauguration day and he was “personally very concerned” about Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: In Pak’s testimony June 13, he detailed his experience with the Trump campaign’s claims of voter fraud.\n\nHe recalled a particular allegation that an election worker took a suitcase full of votes to the ballot box after hours.\n\nBut Pak explained that those weren’t extra votes, or falsely cast votes — they had previously been accidentally missed. It wasn’t a suitcase, Pak said, but a lockbox full of legitimate votes that needed to be counted.\n\nThe FBI investigated the claim, Pak said, but “determined nothing irregular happened in the counting,” and said the claims were false.\n\nLofgren asked Pak to confirm that there was “no widespread fraud sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the election.”\n\n“That is correct,” Pak said.\n\nAl Schmidt\n\nRole: Schmidt is a former commissioner for the city of Philadelphia.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him?\n\nSchmidt was the only Republican member of Philadelphia’s city commission, which oversees the city’s elections. The city was one of the targets of Trump’s claims of voter fraud.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Among the false claims of election fraud was the suggestion that 8,000 dead voters cast ballots in Philadelphia. In the committee’s June 13 hearing, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., asked Schmidt about that claim.\n\n“Not only was there not evidence of 8,000 dead voters voting in Pennsylvania, there wasn’t evidence of eight,” Schmidt said. “We took seriously every case that was referred to us. Nno matter how fantastical or how absurd, we took every one of them seriously, even these.”\n\nSchmidt also provided redacted threats he received after Trump tweeted about him, saying Schmidt refused to investigate “a mountain of corruption.”\n\nThe threats had been general in nature before Trump’s tweet, Schmidt said.After the tweet, they were highly specific and incredibly threatening, he added.\n\n“The threats became much more specific, much more graphic, and included not just me by name, but included members of my family, by name, ages, our address, pictures of our home – every bit of detail you can imagine,” Schmidt said.\n\nChris Stirewalt\n\nRole: Stirewalt is a former Fox News political editor.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Stirewalt was fired in the aftermath of conservative backlash to Fox News correctly calling Arizona for Biden in the 2020 election. Stirewalt is now the political editor for NewsNation. Stirewalt is now the political editor for NewsNation.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: Stirewalt recalled for the committee June 13 the decision to call Arizona for Trump earlier than other networks.\n\n“We already knew that Trump’s chances were very small and getting smaller, based on what we had seen,” Stirewalt said. “So we were able to make the call early. We were able to beat the competition.”\n\nThe committee asked Stirewalt to explain the “red mirage” that was both expected and then present on election night.\n\nHe explained that early results are typically expected to be positive for Republicans, but when mail-in votes are counted, the lead can shrink or disappear.\n\n“The Trump campaign and the president had made it clear they were going to try and exploit this anomaly,” Stirewalt testified.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California asked Stirewalt if it should have been expected that Trump’s lead on election night would shrink.\n\n“It happens every time,” Stirewalt said.\n\nFox News did not carry the first Jan. 6 primetime hearings live, unlike every other major broadcast and cable network, and Stirewalt has not attempted to hide his distaste for his former employer.\n\n“They’re not trying to do journalism,” he said on NewsNation, before reframing that. “Well — whatever they’re trying to do, they’re certainly not achieving that. What they’re trying to do is entertain and keep their audience and move the product.”\n\nAt the June 13 hearing, he stood by his team at Fox News and their reporting on election night.\n\n“Our decision desk was the best in the business, and I was very proud to be a part of it,” he said.\n\nBill Stepien\n\nRole: Stepien is Trump’s former campaign manager.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him?\n\nAs a Trump campaign manager, Stepien was intimately involved with communicating how the former president was faring in states across the country, in the months leading up to Election Day and on election night.\n\nIn its subpoena to Stepien, the committee indicated it was particularly interested in his involvement in Trump’s “Stop the Steal” campaign that promoted the false claim there were voting machine inaccuracies during the 2020 election, messaging that was repeated by rioters who attacked the Capitol. The campaign built fundraising around those false claims despite internal memos that acknowledged that they were false. The committee also accused the campaign of asking states to delay or deny the election results.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. He testified in closed-door hearings when subpoenaed.\n\nThe latest: An hour before the hearing began, the committee said Stepien would no longer testify in person, citing a family emergency. When the hearing began, Cheney said Stepien’s wife went into labor.\n\nThe committee played some excerpts of Stepien’s recorded video testimony, in which Stepien said he repeatedly told Trump the truth about losing the election and the lack of evidence of voter fraud.\n\nStepien said on election night, he thought the Trump campaign should acknowledge votes were still being counted and say it was too early to make a call. Instead, the president made a speech alleging massive voter fraud, without evidence, and claiming he won the election.\n\n“It was far too early to be making any calls like that,” Stepien recalled thinking.\n\nHe also testified that in the days after the election, he told Trump that his chances were “very, very, very bleak,” and said he was frustrated that some of Trump’s advisers were feeding him false information about fraud.\n\n“I didn’t think what was happening was necessarily honest or professional at that point. That led to me stepping away,” Stepien said.\n\nIn contrast to those falsely claiming fraud, “I didn’t mind being categorized as being part of team normal,” Stepien said.\n\nBen Ginsberg\n\nRole: Ginsberg is a conservative elections lawyer best known for his involvement in the 2000 recount of the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Ginsberg counseled the Bush-Cheney presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, and co-chaired the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration.\n\nThroughout the 2020 race, and after the election, he persistently fought Trump’s false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn the days following the 2020 election, Ginsberg told the PBS NewsHour’s Judy Woodruff that Trump “is alleging fraudulent elections and rigged results that there is no evidence for.”\n\n“Those were allegations that were made before this election, based on past elections, with absolutely no proof of that,” Ginsberg added.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes.\n\nThe latest: At the committee hearing, Lofgren questioned Ginsberg about the 62 lawsuits the Trump campaign filed, claiming election fraud, asking if the campaign effectively made its case.\n\n“I’ve looked at the more than 60 [cases] that include more than 180 counts and no. The simple fact is that the Trump campaign did not make its case,” Ginsberg said.\n\nHe also noted there were post-election reviews, and “in each one of those instances there was no credible evidence of fraud produced by the Trump campaign or his supporters.”\n\nBill Barr\n\nRole: Barr was the Trump administration’s attorney general at the time of the 2020 election.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? Barr was in Trump’s inner circle in both the run-up to the election and the immediate aftermath, and played a key role in public communications about the legitimacy of the election.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Barr regularly referred to unfounded worries about election interference or fraud. In July 2020, he claimed there was “a high risk” of “massive” fraud from mail-in voting, though he also said he had “no reason to think” the election would be rigged. And he speculated without evidence that a “foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots.”\n\nBut after Trump lost the election, Barr said publicly his office had seen no evidence of voter fraud, and he stepped down as attorney general before the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWATCH: Barr, Ivanka Trump say they knew there was no voter fraud in 2020 election\n\nCooperated with the committee: Yes.\n\nThe latest: During the first night of hearings on June 9, the committee showed footage of Barr’s closed-door testimony, in which he said he told Trump there was no merit to claims of fraud. Barr also said the false claims of election fraud are what prompted him to resign.\n\nLater in the hearing, the committee showed part of a closed-door interview with former first daughter Ivanka Trump, who confirmed that Barr had told her there was no evidence of election fraud, and that she had believed him.\n\nBarr, his refusal to publicly claim election fraud and his exit from office, is expected to be the theme of the committee’s third hearing June 15. Cheney said in her opening statement that the June 13 hearing will lay out that Trump “corruptly planned to replace the Attorney General of the United States so the U.S. Justice Department would spread his false stolen election claims.”\n\nCaroline Edwards\n\nRole: Capitol police officer present at Jan. 6 riot\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from her? According to a statement issued by the Jan. 6 Committee, Edwards was the first law enforcement officer injured by rioters who attacked the Capitol, leaving her with a brain injury. Though injured, she continued to patrol the Capitol and prevented more rioters from entering the building.\n\nEdwards testified before the committee during its first hearing on June 9. She detailed her injuries for the committee, and the work she did despite those injuries to protect parts of the Capitol from rioters.\n\n“What I saw was just a war scene. It was something like I had seen out of the movies. I couldn’t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up,” Edwards said.\n\nEdwards was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police when the Jan. 6 attack took place, according to USA Today. However, she told the committee nothing in her training would have prepared her for the events of that day.\n\n“Never in my wildest dreams did I think that as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know, I’m trained to detain, you know, a couple of subjects and handle a crowd. But I’m not combat trained,” she said.\n\nEdwards also recounted her confrontation on the Capitol steps with members of the Proud Boys who she witnessed confer among themselves before attacking a police barricade made of bike racks. She worked to keep the Proud Boys contained next to the bike racks. Though she knew she did not have the strength to stop them, she hoped to delay them long enough for more police to arrive for back up. As the barricade was forced forward, she fell backward and was knocked unconscious.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes\n\nThe latest: Edwards testified before the Jan. 6 Committee on June 9. Members of the committee are able to ask her written follow-up questions within ten days of her appearance.\n\nNick Quested\n\nRole: Documentary filmmaker who captured parts of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? According to the committee, Quested and his crew were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, during which they “documented the movements around the Capitol that morning, the first moments of violence against U.S. Capitol Police, and the chaos that ensued.”\n\nQuested was one of two people who testified during the first hearing of the Jan. 6 Committee.\n\nQuested and his crew had been documenting the extremist group the Proud Boys, including their then-leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio. That included following members as they traveled to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6. Quested and his crew documented the activity around the Capitol that morning and some of the first moments of violence, including against Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, who also testified in the June 9 hearing.\n\nThat footage was featured as part of the committee’s hearing.\n\nQuested outlined publicly to the committee what he saw that week, starting with a meeting between Tarrio and Elmer “Stewart” Rhodes, the founder and leader of the extremist group the Oath Keepers, the night before the insurrection.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Quested said he and his team had met up with the Proud Boys to continue filming them.\n\n“They started to walk towards the Capitol. There was a large contingent. More than I had expected,” Quested said, noting that the Proud Boys already began to walk towards the Capitol before former President Donald Trump’s speech by the Ellipse behind the White House ended.\n\n“I was confused to a certain extent while we were walking away from the president’s speech. Because that is what I felt we were there to cover,” Quested said.\n\n“I make efforts to create familiarity between myself and my subjects to make them feel comfortable. And the atmosphere was much darker than it had been in these other days,” Quested said.\n\nTarrio was not in D.C. on the day of the attack, but helped guide activities from afar, the Justice Department said. Tarrio and some of the group’s other leaders were indicted on federal seditious conspiracy charges earlier this week.\n\nCooperated with the committee? Yes. In addition to providing testimony, he also handed over footage to the committee after being issued with a Congressional subpoena.\n\nThe latest: Quested was one of two of the first witnesses to testify at the first public hearing of the committee.\n\nPeter Navarro\n\nRole: Navarro was an economic adviser to Trump at the time of the attack.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? In December 2020, Navarro produced a report in which he falsely claimed he had enough evidence to prove Trump won the 2020 election. In a letter requesting Navarro’s testimony, the House select committee said he “worked with [Trump adviser] Steve Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress’s certification of, and ultimately change the outcome of, the November 2020 presidential election.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Navarro has said he didn’t advocate for the violence on Jan. 6. Instead, part of the plan would have involved former Vice President Mike Pence rejecting Biden’s electors during that day’s joint session of Congress.\n\nIn his book, “In Trump Time,” Navarro says he’d hope to “put certification of the election on ice” to give Congress and state legislatures time to “investigate all of the fraud and election irregularities.” There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nCooperated with the committee: No\n\nThe latest: Navarro on June 17 pleaded not guilty to two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear at a March 2 deposition for the House committee. He also refused to produce “documents and information” they’ve requested.\n\nIn April, the House voted along near-party lines to hold Navarro in contempt of Congress and recommended criminal charges. On June 3, he was indicted by the Department of Justice. At the time, Navarro promised to fight the charges and denied their legitimacy.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Navarro said he was filing a civil suit saying the Jan. 6 committee’s work was unlawful and was intended to have “the Supreme Court address a number of issues that have come with the weaponization of Congress’ investigatory powers” since the Trump administration was in office.\n\nBannon was also indicted on contempt charges in November.\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nRole: Bannon was an adviser to Trump. While he was not employed by the White House in 2021, he remained a close ally.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? The committee says Bannon was communicating with Trump in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol, encouraging Trump to focus on Jan. 6. It also says Bannon met separately with members of Congress the day before the attack, encouraging them to vote against the certification of election results.\n\nBannon was among the first officials subpoenaed by the House committee last September. He refused to comply with the request for an interview and documents, claiming his communications with Trump are protected by executive privilege– the right for certain communications between the president and people in the executive branch to remain confidential. In November, the Justice Department indicted Bannon on two federal charges of contempt of Congress. His trial is scheduled for July.\n\nBannon has claimed he was following the advice of his lawyers in not cooperating with the committee, and did not know he was breaking the law.\n\nCooperated with the committee: No.\n\nThe latest: Bannon’s lawyers have filed their own legal challenge related to Jan. 6, questioning whether the House committee investigating the attack was properly formed under the chamber’s rules.\n\nThe week of June 6, Bannon’s lawyers subpoenaed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all of the committee’s members to question them under oath about the creation of the committee, which was initially supposed to have 13 members, according to its founding resolution. Last summer, Pelosi objected to committee members selected by the GOP, saying they would not be able to properly investigate the attack, angering House conservatives. The committee’s final nine members, all selected by Pelosi, includes seven Democrats and two Republicans.\n\nMark Meadows\n\nRole: Meadows was Trump’s chief of staff at the time of the attack.\n\nWhy does the committee want to hear from him? As Trump’s chief of staff, Meadows was intimately involved in the former president’s communications and actions in his final months in office, as Trump tried to cast the 2020 elections as fraudulent.\n\nIn April, CNN published thousands of text messages between Meadows and various members of congress, lawyers and other Trump allies, before and after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nSome in the run-up to the insurrection focused largely on the false conspiracy theory that the election was invalid, and efforts to stop the certification of results. .\n\nOn the day of the insurrection, Meadows responded to an earlier text from Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, in which the congressman pushed for Pence to reject electoral votes Jordan thought were unconstitutional. In reply, Meadows said, “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen[.]”\n\nOthers captured pleas from lawmakers and allies for Meadows to encourage the president to do something to stop the violence.\n\nAccording to news reports, Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson has testified to Congressional investigators that Meadows had been warned prior to Jan. 6 that the pro-Trump demonstrations may turn violent.\n\nCooperated with the committee: Sometimes.\n\nMembers of the committee have said that Meadows sometimes cooperated with their investigation. He provided some documents like text messages and emails, but in December, stopped cooperating.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/nyregion/trump-ny-fraud-trial-testimony.html', 'Headline': '5 Things We Learned During Trump’s Trial Testimony - The New York Times', 'Snippet': 'James has asked that Mr. Trump pay $250 million and that he and his sons be permanently barred from running a business in New York.

Here’s a look at how many people attended those rallies, crowd size photos, and what happened at each.\n\nBiden Hosted a Socially Distanced, Drive-In Rally Attended By Close to 300 Cars\n\nBiden hosted a rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds. Unlike Trump’s rally, Biden’s was a drive-in rally that enforced social distancing. NBC News reported that Biden’s rally was attended by close to 300 cars.\n\nWhen Biden spoke in Tampa on Thursday evening, he said that Trump had just hosted “a superspreader event here again. He’s spreading more than just the virus, he’s spreading division,” he said.\n\nBiden also advocated for wearing masks. “This isn’t a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty,” he said. “But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science.”\n\nWhile Trump’s rally earlier in the day used water hoses to help cool down supporters, Biden’s rally was interrupted by a heavy downpour of rain, which led to the rally ending early, NBC News reported. Biden told the crowd that he was shortening his speech. “Get out of the rain!” he advised.\n\nBiden spoke about topics like healthcare, the pandemic, and taxes. Supporters honked in their cars to show support.\n\nBiden’s rally enforced social distancing, shared Angie Angers of Bay News 9. She said masks were mandatory if people left their cars and they were asked not to gather in groups.\n\nRaymond Arroyo, a contributor to Fox News, shared the following photos comparing the two rallies:\n\nThousands Attended Trump’s Rally\n\nZac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune said the campaign told him that 15,000 tickets were requested. The number of attendees was estimated as being in the “thousands” and the crowd was packed together tightly.\n\nA large crowd greeted Trump outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The temperature was 87 degrees and so hot that a fire truck sprayed water on the crowd near the back to help them stay cool, TMZ reported.\n\nSome people passed out because the rally got so hot, shared Monica Alba of NBC News. She said medics were being called every five to 10 minutes because of the heat. NBC News later reported that 17 people needed medical attention and about a dozen had to go to the hospital.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump was at the rally and introduced Trump.\n\nThousands attended Trump’s rally, Alba shared, and although they were given masks, some told her that they didn’t feel the need to wear them.\n\nThe crowd was packed shoulder-to-shoulder for the rally.\n\nThis video also shows the crowd.\n\nZac Anderson of the Herald Tribune said the campaign told him that 15,000 tickets were requested. The number of attendees was estimated as being in the “thousands” and the crowd was packed together tightly.\n\nTrump spoke about his platform during his speech, including the economy. He also talked about Hunter Biden and joked that people told him not to do so.\n\nTrump also addressed the pandemic, saying that a vaccine was near and the pandemic was “rounding the corner.”'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-biden-rally-crowd-pennsylvania-b2159715.html', 'Headline': 'Viral video compares crowd size at Trump and Biden midterm events in ...', 'Snippet': 'Donald Trump and his supporters are famously obsessed with crowd size, and a video has gone viral comparing the audiences between recent rallies Mr Trump and Joe Biden held in Pennsylvania this ...'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/donald-trump-rally-spotlighted-biden-trump/', 'Headline': 'PolitiFact | Donald Trump’s rally spotlighted the Biden, Trump ...', 'Snippet': 'However, Trump’s blaming Biden is less sound, economists said.

The full version, along with transcripts and other source material, is expected to be released later this week.\n\nThe panel also voted to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, recommending charges against Trump and two allies.\n\nThe committee\'s findings do not fault the intelligence community or law enforcement for the security failures of Jan. 6, something Republicans are likely to criticize. The summary doesn\'t reveal much new information, but wraps up much of what the committee has already laid out in public hearings.\n\nHere is what the committee says it has established over the course of the year-and-a-half-long investigation:\n\nOn the night of the 2020 election and in the weeks after, the committee says Trump ""purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions."" The committee says those false claims ""provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.""\n\nDespite ""knowing"" that he and his supporters lost dozens of election-related lawsuits and encouragement from his own advisers to concede, Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, the committee notes. ""Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to \'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\' President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome,"" the committee says.\n\nThe committee says Trump ""corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress\' joint session on January 6th,"" despite ""knowing that such an action would be illegal.""\n\nThe committee also asserts Trump ""sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice"" by trying to enlist DOJ officials to ""make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the election effort."" Trump then ""offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing Clark intended to disseminate false information.""\n\nTrump ""unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states,"" the summary continues.\n\nTrump also ""oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives,"" the summary adds.\n\nTrump ""pressured members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several states,"" the summary says.\n\nThe committee alleges Trump ""purposely verified false information filed in federal court.""\n\nBased on false allegations of a stolen election, Trump ""summoned"" his supporters to Washington for Jan. 6, instructing them to ""take back"" their country, even though some of his supporters were armed, the committee says.\n\n""Knowing that a violent attack on the Capitol was underway and knowing that his words would incite further violence, Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence at 2:24 p.m. on January 6th,"" the summary continues.\n\nThe committee asserts Trump knew violence was underway at the Capitol and ""refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol, and instead watched the violent attack unfold on television,"" which ""perpetuated violence at the Capitol and obstructed Congress\'s proceeding to count electoral votes.""\n\nThe committee claims Trump took all of these actions ""in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election.""\n\nThe committee also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies did ""successfully detect the planning for potential violence on January 6th,"" and shared the information within the executive branch.\n\nIntelligence gathered did not suggest that Antifa or other left-wing groups would have violent counter-demonstrations, and they were not involved to ""any material extent"" in the attack, the committee notes.\n\nThe summary also asserts that the intelligence community and law enforcement did not know the full extent of the ""ongoing planning by President Trump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn the certified election results."" The summary also claims the intelligence community and law enforcement did not ""anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer in the crowd in his Ellipse speech.""\n\nThe summary says Jan. 6 would have been ""far worse"" without the bravery of hundreds of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan police officers, and says Capitol Police leadership ""did not anticipate the scale of the violence that would ensure.""\n\nFinally, the summary says Trump ""had the authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day."" The committee also said they ""found no evidence that the Pentagon delayed the timing of deployment of the National Guard.""\n\nRepublicans are likely to criticize the report\'s findings, and have instead focused on how law enforcement and congressional leadership could have better prepared for the assault. GOP lawmakers have already been critical of the committee for not focusing energy on how to prevent another such attack.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans will look into the work of the committee when the GOP takes control of the House in January. McCarthy has said Republicans will launch their own investigation to determine ""why the Capitol complex was not secure"" on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong on Jan. 6, and has repeatedly called the committee\'s investigation a ""witch hunt.""'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145209559/jan-6-committee-final-report', 'Headline': 'The full January 6 report is out. Here are the key details and ...', 'Snippet': 'Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday ...', 'Full_text': 'After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.\n\nThe document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\n""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\nWhat are the committee\'s main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a ""formal mechanism"" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels.\n\nThe committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power,\n\nAnd they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee\'s investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court.\n\nThe committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. ""Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,"" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president\'s election lies and declarations of victory, Trump\'s efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump\'s plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. ""President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and \'fight.\' They clearly got the message,"" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time ""187 minutes of dereliction,"" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nYou can read more on NPR\'s coverage of the committee\'s public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee\'s recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn\'t necessarily mean the department has to act.\n\nIn their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it\'s possible that these four House members don\'t face any repercussions.\n\nBut at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president\'s role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.\n\nNPR\'s Halimah Abdullah, Claudia Grisales, Giulia Heyward, Eric McDaniel, Muthoni Muturi, Barbara Sprunt, Katherine Swartz and Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/jan-6-final-report-findings/', 'Headline': 'Key findings from the Jan. 6 committee’s final report', 'Snippet': 'Dec. 23 at 6:06 a.m. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol released its full, final report late Thursday night.

Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are suing two Southern California cities and several advocacy groups alleging they conspired to infringe on their free speech rights by pressuring venues to cancel a rally in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Thursday, alleges the venues caved to pressure from the cities of Anaheim and Riverside and canceled contracts for their America First rally because they disagreed with Greene and Gaetz politically. The two lawmakers are known for their strong support of former President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the 1st Amendment gives the lawmakers the freedom to use the venues “on the same basis as other organizations and political figures without regard to their viewpoint or the viewpoint of speakers at their event.”\n\nA spokesman for the city of Riverside declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said the city has “not formally received the claim but are aware of it and will be reviewing.”\n\nThe lawsuit also names 10 advocacy or political organizations who allegedly pressured city officials and the venues to not host the rally.\n\nGaetz, Greene and their fundraising committees are seeking a declaration saying each of the defendants violated their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association as part of the lawsuit.\n\nThey are also asking for an injunction prohibiting the cities from denying or “coercing private venues from entering into facilities use contracts with Plaintiffs for future political rallies” and unspecified damages for emotional distress.\n\nAlexander Haberbush, an attorney representing Greene and Gaetz in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nGreene, a Georgia congresswoman, and Gaetz, who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, tried to host their rally at two locations in Orange County and one in Riverside in July 2021, but the venues kept backing out.\n\nThe first location to fall through was the Pacific Hills Banquet & Event Center in Laguna Hills. The venue’s general manager told the Orange County Register at the time it opted to cancel after learning Gaetz and Greene would be speaking.\n\nThe rally was moved to the Riverside Convention Center, but the city quickly started receiving complaints. Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia said at the time that the lawmakers “are the antithesis of everything Riverside stands for.”\n\nRaincross Hospitality Management, which operates the convention center, asserted it was canceling the event because of the discrepancy on the certificate of insurance it had been provided, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWith less than 24 hours until the rally, the group moved the event to the Grand Theater, a private venue in Anaheim, but controversy followed it. Dozens of people contacted the city to decry the event.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a city code enforcement officer called the Grand Theater and told the owner and manager the venue’s conditional use permit would be “in jeopardy if they did not cancel the event.”\n\nWithout a venue, the lawmakers instead held a “peaceful protest against communism” outside Riverside City Hall.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/07/14/gop-reps-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-are-suing-riverside-anaheim/', 'Headline': 'GOP Reps.

In a rally near the White House, one year ago, Trump served his supporters a laundry list of bogus claims about election fraud in swing states. Then-President-elect Joe Biden had won the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, but Trump, as he had for weeks, made false statements about illegal votes being counted. We wrote about a dozen claims, including Trump’s falsehood that “66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.” The Republican official who oversees Georgia’s voting system said, “The actual number is zero.”\n\nTrump also claimed that somehow then-Vice President Mike Pence could initiate a process to overturn the election results and declare Trump the winner. While Trump was speaking, Pence released a letter to Congress saying he doesn’t have the right to do that.\n\n“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence, who served as president of the Senate that day, said.\n\nMany hours after Trump’s speech, at about 3:40 a.m. on Jan. 7, the electoral vote count ended, with Pence announcing that Biden would become the 46th president.\n\nFor more, see “Trump’s Falsehood-Filled ‘Save America’ Rally.”\n\nThe Lead-up to Jan. 6. Five days after the riot, House Democrats introduced legislation to impeach Trump, charging him with “inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” The resolution, approved by the House in a 232-197 vote with the support of 10 Republicans, accused Trump of repeatedly issuing “false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.”\n\nWe had been writing about such claims for months, and we compiled a sampling of Trump’s comments and actions leading up to the impeachment vote, starting with his April 7, 2020, comments that “mail ballots” were “very dangerous” and “fraudulent in many cases.”\n\nFor more, see “Road to a Second Impeachment.”\n\nNational Guard Deployment. National Guard members didn’t arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6 until about 5:40 p.m., when most of the violence had already subsided. In a recorded video the following day, Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.” But that was contradicted by news reports citing unnamed sources who say Trump resisted efforts to bring in the Guard at the outset of the riot. In a Jan. 13 article, we chronicled what was known at the time about the Guard’s deployment.\n\nFor more, see “Timeline of National Guard Deployment to Capitol.”\n\nBlaming Pelosi. Over the summer, House Republicans tried to shift blame for the breach of the Capitol to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying she was “ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security.” But we found their arguments overstated the role of the House speaker in overseeing security of the Capitol and relied on speculation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day. (Trump also pushed this idea in a Jan. 4 statement this year.) Rep. Rodney Davis pointed to the fact that on the afternoon of Jan. 6, the House sergeant at arms sought Pelosi’s permission to bring in the National Guard as evidence that Pelosi was “calling the shots on all of their actions.” A Pelosi aide confirmed the request was made but said the speaker “expects security professionals to make security decisions” and that she only expects “to be briefed about those decisions.” The request also went to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and while both Pelosi and McConnell OK’d bringing in the Guard, the Department of Defense still needed to approve the move.\n\nFor more, see “Republicans’ Shaky, No Evidence Attempt to Cast Blame on Pelosi for Jan. 6.”\n\nHow Many Died? In October, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the Capitol riot resulted in “almost 10 dead.” There is reasoned debate about the number who died as a result of the riot. Ocasio-Cortez includes four law enforcement officials who responded to the Capitol that day and committed suicide in the days and months afterward and two rally participants who died of heart failure. Another rallygoer was initially believed to have been trampled to death but was later determined to have died of an accidental overdose.\n\nWe explained what is publicly known about the deaths of the nine people included in the congresswoman’s tally.\n\nFor more, see “How Many Died as a Result of Capitol Riot?”\n\nUnfounded Theory on FBI Informants. Another no-evidence claim is the idea that “unindicted co-conspirators” mentioned in federal indictments related to the Capitol riot are undercover FBI agents or informants, as conservative outlets have claimed or suggested. Legal experts and federal case law say that government agents and informants cannot be labeled conspirators to a crime.\n\nDuring his June 15 Fox News show, for example, host Tucker Carlson, referencing a story from a conservative website, first said “potentially” and “almost certainly” FBI agents were involved, and then definitively declared that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Republicans in Congress have pushed the unfounded theory as well, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz.\n\nFederal case law from the 1985 case United States v. Rodriguez acknowledged that “government agents and informers cannot be conspirators.”\n\nFor more, see “Conservative Outlets Advance Unfounded Theory About Capitol Attack.”\n\nFalse Claims About Police. One social media meme spread the false claim that a Washington, D.C., police officer who responded to the Capitol breach was really part of the rioting crowd. The side-by-side photos show two different people who bear some resemblance to each other. Another claim that circulated on social media falsely said a video clip proves that “Capitol Police gave protesters OK” to enter the building. And other posts made the unfounded claim that Pelosi “won’t let Capitol Police testify about what happened Jan. 6.” In fact, on July 27, four members of the Capitol Police testified at the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee.\n\nFor more, see “Memes Misidentify D.C. Police Officer as Jan. 6 Protester,” “Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol” and “Capitol Police Expected to Testify During House Committee’s Probe of Jan. 6 Riot.”\n\nImpeachment Vote Sparks Misleading Democratic Ads. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used Republican lawmakers’ votes against impeaching Trump to claim eight lawmakers “stood with Q, not you,” a reference to QAnon, whose acolytes baselessly think a group of elite pedophiles runs the government and the entertainment industry. None of the targeted Republicans is known to be an actual supporter of QAnon, and three of them supported a resolution to censure Trump for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor more, see “Misleading DCCC Ads Link Republicans to QAnon.”\n\nBipartisan Report Didn’t ‘Single Out’ Trump. In the summer, a bipartisan group of four senators released a report on the security and intelligence failures related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. All four — Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Gary Peters, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Rob Portman — have previously said that Trump was at least partly responsible for the attack, but their report did not “single out” Trump “for inciting … the riots,” as a Facebook post from a liberal advocacy group suggested.\n\nThe report did not examine Trump’s role in, or fault him for, the attack. It was “limited in scope” and did not address “what motivated people,” Peters said.\n\nFor more, see “Facebook Post Misleads on Bipartisan Capitol Attack Report and Interview.”\n\nSome Protesters Were ‘Armed.’ Social media posts also misleadingly claimed the attack on the Capitol was not an “armed” insurrection, citing FBI testimony that no guns were seized from suspects that day. But 23 people were charged with having deadly or dangerous weapons during the assault — including a loaded handgun found on a man arrested on Capitol grounds. Other weapons included baseball bats, chemical sprays, a captured police officer’s riot shield, a crowbar, fire extinguishers and a metal flagpole. In legal terms, “armed” means being in possession of any weapon, not just a gun.\n\nFor more, see “Capitol Protesters Were Armed With Variety of Weapons.”\n\nCapitol Police’s Tampa Office. In July, the U.S. Capitol Police announced it would add field offices in Tampa and San Francisco to investigate threats against members of Congress, part of changes the agency was making in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz criticized the move, saying he was “increasingly concerned that our federal government and many elements within it are using these exquisite national security authorities to turn against our own people.”\n\nAn online Change.org petition, now with nearly 3,000 signatures, demanded the removal of the field office in Tampa, claiming it was created “in order to further investigate the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.” But a Capitol Police spokesperson told us that while many plans announced in the July press release were related to reviews of the events of Jan. 6, the plan for field offices long predated the Capitol riot. “The false narrative that this was created after the 6th to go after people who breached the Capitol, that is not accurate,” the spokesperson told us in a phone interview.\n\nFor more, see “The Facts on Capitol Police’s Tampa Office.”\n\nAll of our articles related to the Jan. 6 attack can be found here.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32LN3YT', 'Headline': 'Nancy Pelosi footage revives false January 6 claims, conspiracy ...', 'Snippet': 'Similar posts faulting Pelosi for the riot were shared across social media-- including by conservative activist Jack Posobiec and Donald Trump Jr, former president Donald Trump\'s eldest son, who claimed Pelosi denied a request from Trump for extra National Guard support.

""I\'m sure I\'ll be called conspiracy theorist for thinking this isn\'t a coincidence!""\n\nIn another post, he added: ""Conspiracy theorists are just people capable of pattern recognition.""\n\nThe allegations followed the ninth hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, during which the committee aired new footage of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer phoning various government officials for help protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe video was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker\'s daughter and a documentary filmmaker who has for years produced documentaries for HBO.\n\nBut Pelosi did not stage the attack, which saw a mob of Trump supporters push past barriers, fight police, smash windows and breach the building as they tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results showing Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThe event was witnessed by the world on live television, as well as the lawmakers who were forced to leave their chambers during the tumult. Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted while protecting the Capitol. Some of those officers have testified in public hearings about the attack.\n\nAs of October 6, more than 880 people have been arrested in relation to January 6, according to the US Justice Department. More than 400 have pleaded guilty.\n\nFilming for a documentary\n\nDrew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi\'s deputy chief of staff, told AFP the claims that the speaker paid for a camera crew are ""silly"" and ""made up.""\n\n""The Speaker did not hire her daughter,"" Hammill said in an email. ""Alexandra was shooting video on her own on a handheld camera. There was no crew.""\n\nCNN obtained additional footage from Alexandra Pelosi and HBO, its sister network. As CNN anchor Anderson Cooper aired the video on his show hours after the October 13 hearing from the House committee, he said it was ""part of a documentary that Alexandra Pelosi has been working on for years.""\n\n""She was with her mom and her family documenting what was supposed to be a peaceful transfer of political power on January 6, the kind of day that distinguishes this country from so many others, when things came unglued,"" Cooper said.\n\nContacted by AFP, Alexandra Pelosi did not answer questions, saying she could not take seriously any claim about staging the attack.\n\nOther social media posts suggested Nancy Pelosi faked the phone calls captured in her daughter\'s footage because the screen on her handset appeared turned off at one point. Hammill said he believes Pelosi was using an iPhone in the moment -- the full video of which shows her placing the call before the screen goes dark. Such devices typically have a ""proximity sensor,"" a feature built in to save battery and prevent callers from accidentally hitting buttons while talking.\n\nPelosi did not reject National Guard\n\nRegarding her personal conduct, Pelosi did not reject an order from Trump to authorize additional members of the National Guard to protect the Capitol, as Trump\'s allies have insisted for months. She would have been unable to do so; the DC National Guard ""reports only to the President,"" according to its website.\n\n""The only governmental officials who have authority to activate National Guard service members are the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, a state governor, and an adjutant general of a state,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank.\n\n""If the president calls the National Guard to the US Capitol, no congressional official has the unilateral authority to decline its service.,"" added Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the non-profit US Capitol Historical Society. ""Even so, there is no evidence whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi attempted to.”\n\nPaul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms at the time of the attack, testified in 2021 that he did not confer with congressional leadership about requesting further National Guard support until January 6.

Support NRA-ILA. On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. Media and gun control ...', 'Full_text': 'On Tuesday, Joe Biden issued an executive order on gun control that could accurately be described as a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nMedia and gun control groups that beforehand had been salivating over the idea that the measure would impose “universal background checks” for firearm transfers had to content themselves with a vague directive for Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop a “plan” to move in that direction.\n\nAnd while the order’s other provisions were similarly vague and insubstantial, there is no doubt what it all adds up to: antagonism toward gun ownership is now the official policy of the U.S. government’s Executive Branch.\n\nThe good news for gun owners is that — after multiple rounds of anti-gun executive orders in the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations — there isn’t a lot that can plausibly be done administratively on that front that has not already been done. Therefore, nothing in the order itself immediately or operationally limits Second Amendment rights. The order even acknowledges that it will take further action from Congress to achieve the big ticket items on Biden’s gun control wish list, including banning ALL private firearm transfers, as well as so-called “assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nOn the other hand, what has been done has often ignored the limitations imposed by federal statutes and the Constitution itself. What will actually come from Biden’s instructions to the bureaucracy in his latest order is therefore anybody’s guess.\n\nComplicating the picture was the enactment last summer of the misnamed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The NRA opposed the legislation, warning that its vague language gave anti-gun officials nebulous authorities that could be abused to target law-abiding gun owners and firearm-related businesses.\n\nNow, Biden is basically directing an alphabet soup of federal departments — including Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security— to comb through the BSCA and come up with their own plans to implement it to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne of the most onerous aspects of the BSCA was its lowering of the threshold for when a federal dealer’s license (FFL) is needed to sell or transfer firearms. Previously, an individual only needed an FFL when engaged in “a course of trade or business“ involving “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms with the “principal objective” of “livelihood and profit.” The BSCA removed the livelihood element so that profit seeking alone would fulfill the required objective of the sales.\n\nThis change broadened the FFL requirement, but it’s far from clear what that means in a practical sense. Fortunately, a “course” of “repetitive” buying and reselling of firearms is still necessary. But no one seems to know where the lines are now drawn.\n\nEven national gun control groups haven’t come to a shared understanding. Brady-Giffords advocates for a numerical threshold of annual sales, an approach the Obama-Biden ATF specifically rejected under the “livelihood and profit” language. Meanwhile, Everytown argues that ANY firearm sale at a gun show or pursuant to an ad is presumptive proof the threshold has been met. But this was the standard contained in the Manchin-Toomey legislation that Congress itself rejected during the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nThus, what Garland’s background check “plan” will look like and how it will be implemented remains a mystery.\n\nMost of the other directives in the order boil down to a general principle that federal agencies should use whatever authorities they have to make life more difficult for gun owners or the businesses that serve them. Biden’s introductory statement that “we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation” demonstrates that he blames lawful industry — not the lawless, predatory criminals pulling triggers — for firearm-related violence. As long as he continues to labor under that delusion, little progress will be made on reducing violent crime, which not coincidentally tends to be concentrated in areas under legacy control of Biden’s political party.\n\nBesides the background check provisions, another aspect of the order that could eventually lead to substantial infringements involves requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to “further firearm and public safety practices” through its “acquisition of firearms.”\n\nSimilar plans have long been proposed by gun control activists for the law enforcement agencies of large cities. The basic idea is that companies bidding on firearm-related contracts would have to commit to developing “safer” firearm designs, such as the fabled “smart guns,” or “best practices” that limited the sorts of products they make available to the civilian market.\n\nSuch plans have generally been rejected, however, as agencies have pushed back on requirements that would limit their officers’ access to the highest quality equipment. Nevertheless, DoD’s unparalleled purchasing power, and its increasing politicization, are reasons for concern.\n\nOther aspects of the order indicate how impoverished and detached from reality the “thinking” is that underlies the gun control movement.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission is “encouraged” to “issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and … to civilians, including through the use of military imagery.” This is merely a retread of a recently resurrected gun control effort from the 1990s. Minors, of course, are legally prohibited from buying firearms at retail. And “military imagery” is used to market everything from sunglasses to automobiles without any negative consequences. In any case, the point of this exercise is not to reduce crime. It is to exploit a judicially-created loophole in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and make it easier for activists to pursue extortionate lawsuits against the firearm industry.\n\nA host of federal components are also encouraged to do whatever they can “to encourage effective use of … ‘red flag’ laws.” This basically means encouraging citizens to accuse each other in court of being too dangerous to have guns and letting a judge gaze into a crystal ball or use some other non-scientific hokum to predict an individual’s future behavior and determine that person’s civil rights based on things that have not even happened. Again, how the agencies will fulfill this mandate is anybody’s guess. But the inclusion of the Department of Education indicates that schools may soon be involved in targeting the firearms in students’ homes for seizure.\n\nIn summary, Biden’s latest executive order is not so much a roadmap as a declaration: gun ownership and firearm-related businesses are bad and a “whole of government approach” must be used to suppress them. Stay tuned to this page for details on what that looks like as the federal departments mobilize against the Second Amendment in the months ahead.

Under the proposed rule, Biden’s ATF would go well beyond statutory authority to fabricate presumptions of when an individual needs be an FFL, and the rule itself acknowledges its unlawfulness.\n\nBiden's ATF is using the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (“BSCA”) that was signed into law in 2022 as the impetus for the proposed rule. For background, the BSCA amended the definition of “Engaged in the Business” to read:\n\n“a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to predominantly earn a profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms,” (18 U.S.C 921(a)21)\n\nand further defined “to predominantly earn a profit” to mean:\n\n“that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection.” (18 U.S.C. 921(a)(22).\n\nATF’s recently proposed rule now aims to create several presumptions when a person is “engaged in the business,” despite the abovementioned definition that contains no such presumptions.\n\nThe law is clear that a person “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms” is not “engaged in the business.” Despite these clear allowances, the proposed rule contains a presumption regarding renting a table at a gun show, collector show, or other swap meet. This conduct is clearly protected under federal statute if the person is only making “occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases” or if the person is using the table to sell all or part of a collection of firearms.\n\nThe presumptions go even further, and some would deter what many would consider responsible behavior when selling a firearm. There are presumptions of being “engaged in the business” where a person includes the factory packaging with “like new” firearms or where a person keeps detailed records regarding their firearm sales.\n\nOf course, “factory packaging” could include the instruction manual, the included factory lock, and the case (which is likely suitable for safely transporting or storing the firearm). All of these items could be helpful to a new buyer (especially if the buyer is a first time gun owner), but the proposed rule would effectively punish including these items with a firearm.\n\nAnd, treating detailed records regarding sales as evidence of a person being “engaged in business” just incentivizes sellers to keep no records at all. Apparently, the government is fine with making firearm tracing all that more difficult.\n\nRemarkably, the government doesn’t even believe these made-up presumptions are lawful. The proposed rule itself notes that “[t]he rebuttable presumptions [] shall not apply to any criminal case, although they may be useful to courts in criminal cases, for example, when instructing juries regarding permissible inferences.” One might wonder why a new proposed definition of a term that is used in federal criminal statutes cannot be used in criminal cases. The answer is likely that the government knows their own position is unlawful and they do not believe the regulation has any chance of surviving the application of the rule of lenity in a criminal case, where the accused is given the benefit of the doubt when a statutory term is ambiguous.\n\nBeyond the tacit admission of the unlawfulness of the rule, the government does get one thing right. They correctly admit that the statute does not give them the authority to set a limit on the number of firearm transactions that a person can engage in before needing to be licensed. However, in true government form, after making this admission, the rule goes on to describe how even a single transaction could trigger the need to be licensed. So much for the statutory requirement that a person engage in “repetitive purchase and resale” before needing a license.\n\nThe Biden Administration claims that these changes can help move federal law towards so-called “universal background checks,” but that is potentially a trap for law-abiding gun owners. Transferring a firearm through a licensed dealer to run a background check does nothing to help a seller if they meet the government’s new expanded definition of “engaged in the business.” In fact, doing so could provide more evidence to the ATF to use against a seller that they claim is dealing in firearms without an FFL.\n\nMoreover, it’s important to note that this proposed rule and push to require more people become licensed dealers is occurring under the backdrop of the Biden Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, where the ATF is shutting down licensed dealers at an unprecedented pace. The irony that Biden wants to require as many individuals as possible become licensed dealers, while at the same time making it as difficult as possible be an FFL.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-another-life-saving-step-to-keep-guns-out-of-dangerous-hands/', 'Headline': 'FACT SHEET: Biden- - The White House', 'Snippet': 'It builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat the epidemic of gun violence.

When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.\n\nResidents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores. Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.\n\nPresident Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his State of the Union address, President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”\n\nIn April, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to enhance access to home and community-based services, raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents smoothly transition back home from nursing homes, and advance a government-wide strategy to lift up family caregivers. It also builds on the President’s 2024 budget request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.\n\nToday, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels. If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.\n\nTo improve nursing home safety in the short-term, CMS is also announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse care. These actions will help address substandard care and strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing requirements come into effect.\n\nThe HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance, examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness planning by facilities.\n\nIn addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing workforce:\n\nCMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career pathways campaign. The campaign will help recruit, train, retain, and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff. This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care at home, including significant investments in home and community-based services.\n\nSetting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home Staffing\n\nStaffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care. For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even a 20-minute increase in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with 22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is associated with better quality of patient care and patient health outcomes. Chronic understaffing disproportionately affects facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing homes and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.\n\nResearch suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those homes. For example, a working paper examining 18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%, increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%, decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional 20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.\n\nBased on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, CMSis proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels. Under the proposed rule, if finalized:\n\nNursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this requirement.\n\nIn addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time, nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day. Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.\n\nNurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal, nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to meet this requirement.\n\nWhen accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.\n\nThe proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives, to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing requirements would not be preempted.\n\nThe federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years and all other facilities would have two years.\n\nThe proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in staffing.\n\nThe proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIncreasing Nursing Home Accountability\n\nAs the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking action to:\n\nIncrease Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nEnsure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nImprove Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nCrack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhance Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities. But Congress also needs to act. For over eight years, funding for survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about nursing homes has risen. That’s why the President’s 2024 budget called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.\n\nGrowing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality\n\nCMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.\n\nThese new investments are on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Nursing Expansion Grant program made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated to programs across the country to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and educators.\n\nHRSA has also provided grant funding to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing those students with clinical exposure.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment program with $200 million in funding.\n\nTying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the health workforce through its Health Workforce Initiative by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved communities.\n\nBuilding on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress\n\nToday’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the President’s Action Plan. These include:\n\nShedding light on ownership and management. CMS issued a proposed rule requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure of whether these entities are private equity investors or real estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also released data on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying common ownership across facilities.\n\nIncentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid funding. CMS issued a final rule updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS has also issued a bulletin encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and retention.\n\nStrengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes. CMS implemented escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical assistance to help such facilities improve.\n\nAddressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing. CMS is giving the public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on audit findings involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.\n\nPreventing abuse and Medicare fraud. CMS issued a final rule requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal background checks.\n\nCracking down on illegal debt collection. CMS and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home debt.\n\nImproving pandemic preparedness. CMS updated guidance to require an infection control specialist be on site at least part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.\n\nImproving families’ ability to comparison shop. Caregivers and prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and Care Compare, including new data on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as owners, affiliated entities, and chains.\n\nIncreasing vaccination access. HHS is working to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. CMS finalized the adoption of quality measures intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and workers and provide education on their benefits.\n\n###'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/01/hhs-proposes-minimum-staffing-standards-enhance-safety-quality-in-nursing-homes.html', 'Headline': 'HHS Proposes Minimum Staffing Standards to Enhance Safety and Quality ...', 'Snippet': 'Builds on President Biden’s Historic Commitment to Create a Long-Term Care System Where People Can Live with Dignity .

This proposed rule builds on the President’s historic Action Plan for Nursing Home Reform launched in the 2022 State of the Union.\n\nToday’s action is one among many advanced by the Biden-Harris Administration to build a long-term care system where all older Americans can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can receive high quality services in the setting of their choice, where family caregivers are adequately supported, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union.\n\n“Establishing minimum staffing standards for nursing homes will improve resident safety and promote high-quality care so residents and their families can have peace of mind,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “When facilities are understaffed, residents suffer. They might be unable to use the bathroom, shower, maintain hygiene, change clothes, get out of bed, or have someone respond to their call for assistance. Comprehensive staffing reforms can improve working conditions, leading to higher wages and better retention for this dedicated workforce.”\n\n“CMS is proud to be leading the President’s initiative to improve the lives of over 1.2 million residents who reside in Medicare and Medicaid-certified long-term care facilities, and those who will need that care in the future,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Today, we took an important first step to propose new staffing requirements that will hold nursing homes accountable and make sure that residents get the safe, high-quality care that they deserve.”\n\nUnder CMS’s proposal, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid would be required to meet specific nurse staffing levels that promote safe, high-quality care for residents. Nursing homes would need to provide residents with a minimum of 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident per day, and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident per day, exceeding existing standards in nearly all states. CMS estimates approximately three quarters (75%) of nursing homes would have to strengthen staffing in their facilities. As the long-term care sector continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed standards take into consideration local realities in rural and underserved communities through staggered implementation and exemptions processes.\n\nIn addition, nursing homes would also be required to ensure a registered nurse is on site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and to complete robust facility assessments on staffing needs. Facilities would continue to be required to provide staffing that meets the needs of the individual residents they serve, which may require higher levels of staffing above the proposed minimum standards.\n\nCMS also proposes to require states to collect and report on compensation for workers as a percentage of Medicaid payments for those working in nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These policies build on CMS’ recent proposals to support compensation for direct care workers in home- and community-based settings and to publish Medicaid data on average hourly pay rates for home care workers. This enhanced transparency will aid efforts to support and stabilize the long-term care workforce across settings. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to strengthening access to high-quality long-term care both at home, in the community as well as in nursing homes and other facilities.\n\nAdditionally, CMS announced a national campaign to support staffing in nursing homes. As part of the HHS Workforce Initiative, CMS will work with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other partners to make it easier for individuals to enter careers in nursing homes, investing over $75 million in financial incentives, such as scholarships and tuition reimbursement. This staffing campaign builds on other actions by HHS and the Department of Labor to build the nursing workforce.\n\n“Wages are an important part of job quality and drive challenges in recruitment and retention of direct care workers. Our research shows that in many places these workers can earn higher wages doing other entry-level work,” said Miranda Lynch-Smith, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\n\nMore than 500,000 direct care workers provide care in nursing homes, assisting residents with daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, and eating. This work, performed primarily by women of color, is significantly undervalued. Direct care workers across long-term care settings earn low wages, rarely receive health and retirement benefits, and experience high injury rates. Improving working conditions and wages will lead to improvements in the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and enable nursing staff to provide safer care.\n\nFindings published by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation show that wages for direct care workers trail other entry-level jobs. In 2019, median wages for nursing assistants were lower than the wages of other entry level jobs in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As an example, the median wage for nursing assistants in Louisiana is $10.90 per hour, compared to $13.41 for other entry-level positions. This is despite the significant demands of direct care jobs and their essential role in meeting the long-term care needs of older adults and people with disabilities.\n\nOther announcements from CMS and the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made today would increase transparency, enhance enforcement of existing standards, increase accountability, and ensure safe, high-quality, and dignified care for people living in nursing homes. These announcements include:\n\nIncreasing Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing: CMS is expanding audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as residents and their families, have accurate information, including through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.\n\nImproving Nursing Home Inspections: CMS will undertake new analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.\n\nEnsuring Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care: HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These “related party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer funds are being used by nursing homes, but also prevent a transparent and accurate assessment of whether profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers.\n\nCracking Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices and Risks: Grave concerns persist that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent actions by CMS to increase oversight of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.\n\nEnhancing Resident Safety During Emergencies: Nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health emergencies and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges and identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.\n\nThe proposed rule is available at https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current\n\nThe ASPE report is available at: https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/dcw-wages'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197824584/the-biden-administration-proposes-new-federal-standards-for-nursing-home-care', 'Headline': 'Biden New Federal Standards for Nursing Home Care : NPR', 'Snippet': ""NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after the Biden Administration proposed a new national standard for staffing nursing homes.""}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/01/biden-aims-to-increase-staffing-at-nursing-homes-with-national-rule/70737187007/', 'Headline': 'Biden proposes first-ever nursing home staff minimums - USA TODAY', 'Snippet': ""Over the first 90 days of 2023, only 141 of the nation’s nearly 15,000 skilled nursing facilities met two core standards in President Joe Biden's staffing proposal, according to a USA TODAY ...""}, 5: {'URL': 'https://apnews.com/article/biden-nursing-home-staffing-ebd1aad4a8bb13f892b930cae2f3f1cd', 'Headline': 'US will regulate nursing home staffing for first time, but proposal ...', 'Snippet': 'FILE - Bret Harte Retirement Inn residents make their way down to the dining room for lunch, May 6, 2020, in Grass Valley, Calif.

But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a “shocking admission” and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nFull Story\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n“At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.”\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n“BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n“I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n“Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine.\n\nThat’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.”\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.”\n\n“All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we’ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n“Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nClarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness.\n\nEditor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Governments implemented various policies aimed at containing the spread of infection and stabilizing their economies. Many institutions—including the Economist Intelligence Unit1, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)2, NLI Research Institute3, and Bloomberg4—have assessed global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evaluation criteria differ across these institutions (Supplementary Information 1–3), and their studies have had different focuses and produced varying evaluation results.\n\nHere, we introduce a set of criteria for assessing virus-containment effectiveness, where the aim of containment is to minimize harm to societies and economies. The proposed criteria include several previously examined indicators, namely monthly cases per 100,000 members of a population (per capita), fatality rate, and GDP loss. Additionally, because OxCGRT\'s stringency index (SI)2 cannot reflect rigor accurately based on monthly case numbers (Supplementary Information 4), we propose a lockdown efficiency (LE) parameter, which relates stringency to incidence5 (Supplementary Information 5). We include the following five OxCGRT indicators of health-system policies2: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, facial coverings, and (from December 2020 onward) vaccination policy.\n\nTo track long-term impacts on health literacy and mental health, we collated data from Google searches for “wash hands”, “face mask”, and “insomnia” as surrogates for national population health literacy and mental health. Surveys on COVID-19–related mental health and health literacy are mostly based on self-reported, cross-sectional studies and rarely multinational6. However, population health literacy and mental health trends have been shown to be reflected in search volume trends7,8. The search engine analysis website Google Trends has been used for population mental-health surveillance as well as for long-term tracking of depression9 and suicide10.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines cast new hope for curbing the pandemic. Until August 19, 2021, the World Health Organization had issued only emergency-use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines11. By September 12, 2021, 42% of the worldwide population had received at least one dose of a vaccine12. Therefore, we incorporate vaccine-related indicators into our research.\n\nWe propose a set of ten indices, including four government policy and hygiene education (GP&HE) indicators and six vital health and socioeconomic (VH&SE) measures. Our research is divided into pre- and post-vaccine availability phases. For the first phase (March 2020 to November 2020), we focus on evaluating the appropriateness of the LE indicator, which we developed using linear mixed models to determine how each GP&HE indicator correlates with each VH&SE measure. In the second phase during which there was ongoing vaccine distribution (December 2020 to November 2021), we added vaccine-related indicators to enable more comprehensive containment performance analyses. We compared indicator scores for 50 distinctly governed territories.\n\nOur scoring system, modified from previous studies2,3, includes GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures. The GP&HE indicators include: LE; health-system policies; health literacy indicators; and vaccine coverage of the population (December 2020 onward). The VH&SE measures include: one-month cases per capita; infection growth rate; fatality rate; GDP loss due to the pandemic; unemployment rate; and psychological impact (Table 1)2,5,13,14,15.\n\nGP&HE indicators\n\nGovernment response is associated with COVID-19 incidence2. Our newly introduced indicator LE is calculated based on COVID-19 incidence data and the SI2, a factor that does not account for COVID-19 incidence. LE has a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4 and 5).\n\nWe developed another indicator called health-system policies, which is a simple average of the four OxCGRT indicators: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, and facial coverings2. Each of these indicators is derived from daily data, and thus could potentially be represented with monthly means or modes. We used monthly modes as the representative score for each month. From December 2020 onward, we added OxCGRT vaccination policy2 to the calculation of the health-system policies indicator.\n\nHealth literacy is beneficial to reducing the spread of infectious diseases7. Therefore, Google Trends were used to obtain search trends for “wash hands” and “face mask”, which act as surrogate indicators of health literacy7 (Supplementary Information 6).\n\nFor the second phase of the research (December 2020–November 2021), we added the aforementioned indicator people covered by vaccines15 by modifying the calculation of health-system policies to include vaccination policy. This indicator was calculated as the ratio of the number of vaccine doses administered to the number of doses required for full vaccination. For simplicity, we assumed that every individual in each country needs only two doses of vaccine.\n\nVH&SE measures\n\nNLI Research Institute definitions of one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and fatality rate were adopted3. Unemployment rate and GDP loss were defined relative to the same timeframe in 2020–2021 and 2019–2020 (Table 1). We quantified change in searches for “insomnia” to indicate the extent of the pandemic’s impact on a population’s mental health. Searches for insomnia have been used to assess the mental impact of COVID-198,16,17 more commonly than searches for anxiety, panic attack17,18, depression8, or suicide8.\n\nCorrelation analyses\n\nIn phase one, linear mixed models were used to explore the relationship between each GP&HE indicator and VH&SE measure. Because these values vary over time and may affect each other, we conducted two-stage analyses (Supplementary Information 4). We tested LE and SI legitimacy2. In phase two, we calculated Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficients to determine whether the indicator “people covered by vaccines” correlates with three vital health indicators, namely one-month cases per capita, infection growth rate, and one-month case fatality rate.\n\nScoring of GP&HE indicators and VH&SE measures\n\nWe ranked the performance of 50 countries and territories according to total indicator scores (Supplementary Information 7 and 8), where a higher score implies better containment performance. We graphed the score distribution (Supplementary Figs. S11-S31) to visualize the relationship between pre-pandemic baseline risk levels and monthly containment scores. We assigned all 50 countries and territories to low, medium, or high baseline risk categories and calculated monthly average containment scores for each risk level (Supplementary Information 9).\n\nGeographic comparison\n\nWe calculated monthly average containment scores for six geographic group and conducted two-sample t-tests and Mann–Whitney U-tests to compare containment performance between Latin American and non-Latin American countries and between Asian and non-Asian countries prior to vaccine introduction (Supplementary Information 10 and 11). Additionally, we compared mean containment performance scores before versus after inclusion of vaccine indicators (Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted via SAS software (version 9.4); P values were two-tailed with 0.05 significance level.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our study results in relation to uncertainties in the indicator calculation methods and the inclusion/exclusion of Google Trends indicators. Nine scenarios were evaluated (e.g. daily score means vs. modes; see Supplementary Table S35). The results obtained with different methods of calculating indices are given in Supplementary Tables S36–S40. Revised calculations with the inclusion of Google Trends are reported in Supplementary Tables S41–S44. The results obtained with the main scenarios (as defined in Table 1) are shown in Supplementary Tables S45 and S46, with the former including Google Trends indicators and the latter excluding Google Trends indicators. For the sensitivity analysis, we compared: (1) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S40 to the results in Supplementary Table S46; (2) data in each of Supplementary Tables S41–S44 to the results in Supplementary Table S45; and (3) data in each of Supplementary Tables S36–S39 to data in respective Supplementary Tables S41–S44 (i.e., Supplementary Table S41 vs. Supplementary Table S36, Supplementary Table S42 vs. Supplementary Table S37; Supplementary Table S43 vs. Supplementary Table S38; Supplementary Table S44 vs. Supplementary Table S39).\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe institutional review board of the National Health Research Institutes approved this study (EC1091110-E-R1).\n\nComparison between LE and SI prior to vaccine availability\n\nTwo-stage linear mixed models revealed no reasonable relationship between OxCGRT’s SI and one-month cases per capita (Supplementary Information 4). For each unit increase in the SI in July 2020, the estimated one-month cases per capita in August 2020 increased by 7.83 people (P = 0.03; Supplementary Table S2). Similar trends are observable for other months, contradicting the expectation that an increase in government policies in month s should reduce case numbers in month s + 1.\n\nFor every unit of increase in LE (defined in Table 1) in month s, the estimated one-month cases per capita in month s + 1 decreases. For each unit of increase in LE in September and October 2020, one-month cases per capita in October and November 2020 decrease by 629.55 and 597.94 people, respectively (both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S3). Although the relationships between LE and one-month cases per capita are not statistically significant in other months, we observe a consistent downward trend in cases subsequent to lockdowns.\n\nFrom our analyses, we deduce that our LE indicator is legitimate, and that the SI does not have a reasonable correlation with one-month cases per capita. Therefore, we use LE as an indicator in our subsequent evaluation.\n\nTwo stage-linear mixed models also show that the health-system policy in month s does impact fatality in month s + 1 within some periods of time. For every unit of increase in health-system policies in April and May 2020, fatality rates in May and June 2020 decrease by 7.84% and 3.86%, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).\n\nCOVID-19 containment effectiveness\n\nPerformance scores for citizens’ health literacy and insomnia (Google Trends data) for six territories over the 21-month study period are shown in Fig. 1. All monthly COVID-19 containment rankings and scores from March 2020 to November 2021 are shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 and in Supplementary Tables S13–S33 (Supplementary Information 8 and 12). The best performing countries and territories in 2020 are located mainly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and New Zealand.\n\nBaseline risk\n\nLow- and middle-baseline-risk territories are concentrated in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan, whereas high-baseline-risk nations are located mostly in Europe, including France and the UK. Countries in the Americas span the three risk levels (Fig. 3a). In the first phase, most low- and middle-baseline-risk countries and territories achieved better containment than their high-risk counterparts. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Finland, were able to restrain COVID-19 transmission despite having high baseline risk levels (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information 9 and Supplementary Fig. S32a).\n\nGeographical comparison prior to vaccine allocation\n\nPrior to vaccine distribution, Latin America was severely impacted by the pandemic, while Oceania and Asia had good containment (Fig. 4a). Non-Latin American nations achieved better overall containment performance than their Latin American counterparts, which were severely affected. From April 2020 to September 2020, performance differed between these two groups, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.027; Supplementary Information 10).\n\nAsian governments outperformed their non-Asian counterparts in phase one (Supplementary Information 11). From March to November 2020, with the exception of July 2020, performance scores of Asian countries were higher than those of non-Asian countries, with and without Google Trends data inclusion (P < 0.039).\n\nAsian countries performed dramatically better than non-Asian countries in LE and health-system policies early in the pandemic (April 2020 LE scores P = 0.007; March/April 2020 health-system policy scores P < 0.003). These results suggest that Asian governments enacted effective policies early (Supplementary Information 11).\n\nScoring system robustness\n\nSensitivity analyses revealed that (1) changing indicator calculation methods and (2) adding Google Trends indicators altered overall rankings slightly (Supplementary Information 13).\n\nPerformance after vaccine distribution\n\nThe best performers in 2020 were mostly in Asia and Oceania, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and New Zealand. After vaccine indicators are included, the containment performance scores of these countries decrease. Inclusion of vaccine indicators from December 2020 onward results in higher containment performance scores in Singapore, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina (Figs. 2, 3b,c and 4). Among the six geographic regions analyzed, North American countries have the highest vaccine coverage. Their containment performance improves rapidly when vaccine indicators are included. Similar improvements are observed in Europe and Latin America (Fig. 4). Most high-baseline risk countries benefit from their high vaccination coverage (Supplementary Fig. S32).\n\nVaccination coverage\n\nIn the first 6 months of vaccine distribution, one-month cases per capita in month t correlates positively with vaccine coverage in month t and subsequent months. With the exception of the relationship between one-month cases per capita in May 2021 and people covered by vaccines in August 2021, all remaining months correlated (P < 0.0246). In the first 3 months after vaccine distribution ensued (December 2020–February 2021), people covered by vaccines in month t correlated negatively with infection growth rate in the subsequent t + 3, t + 4, or t + 5 months (P < 0.0461). Starting in March 2021, people covered by vaccines correlates negatively with infection growth rate in respective subsequent months, though the relationship does not reach statistical significance for all months. A delayed negative correlation of people covered by vaccines with fatality rate can be seen. Starting from June 2021, the number of people vaccinated in month t correlated negatively with fatality rate in month t and subsequent months (P < 0.0394) (Supplementary Tables S47–S49).\n\nTo evaluate COVID-19 containment performance impartially, we developed and tested a comprehensive evaluation method that accounts for GP&HE indicators, VH&SE measures, and vaccination. LE captures a nation’s effectiveness in enacting measures according to recent incidence. As variants continue to emerge, a new normal, in which pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are considered should be established. Because it is unreasonable to expect life to normalize completely in the short term, we did not include the global normalcy index19 in our analyses.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of the Google Trends indicator altered the overall rankings of the 50 examined countries and territories slightly. We included it for three reasons: Google Trends data reflect health literacy and impacts on mental health7,8; none of the global institutions assessing COVID-19 containment effectiveness have included public responses in their evaluation criteria; and we believe that public response is important for transmission control.\n\nPrior to vaccine allocation, some countries and territories in Asia and Oceania were more successful at suppressing COVID-19 outbreaks than their European and American counterparts. They exhibited a relative weakening of containment performance after inclusion of the vaccine indicator (since December 2020), likely due, at least in part, to their lower vaccination coverage (Supplementary Information 12, Fig. 4).\n\nNew Zealand and Singapore emerged as the most stable performers. New Zealand has been steadfast in its fight against the vexatious COVID-19, increasing its LE to overcome spikes in infection (March/April 2020) and in fatality (May 2020). Successful containment has contributed to their economic stability during the first phase of pandemic (Supplementary Information 12). After New Zealand was invaded by the Delta variant in August 202120, the number of confirmed cases and infection rates increased, and New Zealand responded with an accelerated vaccination strategy (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nAlthough Singapore did not control rapid viral spread initially, they recovered from outbreaks well. Following a 5-month period of rising cases (April–August 2020), the Singapore government improved its health-system policies and LE, leading to decreased case numbers thereafter. Since January 2021, Singapore has been administering vaccines efficiently, making it a model nation for curbing COVID-19 (Supplementary Information 12). However, the surge in coronavirus infections and confirmed cases in Singapore since September 2021 may be related to Singapore’s “coexisting with COVID-19” strategy and the Delta variant outbreak21,22. Whether Singapore can achieve the goal of ""live with the virus"" has become the focus of global attention.\n\nChanges in containment performance scores of six locations associated with notable performance, activities, or policies are shown in Fig. 1. Denmark and the UK have high vaccination coverage23. Denmark lifted restrictions on September 10, 202124. Starting on July 19, 2021, the UK lifted most of its restrictions and removed social distancing recommendations25. In all US regions, restrictions have eased and people have returned to generally normal life26. The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8 and from August 24 to September 5 of 2021, respectively27. Vietnam was Asia\'s top-performing economy in 202028. Taiwan has been praised for its 253-day streak without local infections29.\n\nDenmark\'s infection growth increased rapidly from September 2020 to January 2021, though their fatality rate remained low. Transmission was mitigated through strict health-system policies, improved LE, and mass vaccinations. Although the number of confirmed cases increased after May 2021, the fatality rate was low. The pandemic within Denmark appeared to be under stable control, but at the end of the study Denmark faced another new wave of outbreaks, the development of which remains to be seen (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nContainment performance in the UK was not satisfactory in phase one. The UK improved LE and health-system policies while administering vaccinations on a massive scale. These efforts enabled a gradual containment of COVID-19 transmission, which was suppressed by March 2021. There was a case/infection growth surge in June 2021 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nThe USA did not control infection well in the first phase, but its containment performance improved in the second phase. They have endured large numbers of confirmed cases with cascading regional surges (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nJapan adopted inclusive health-system policies. Although their confirmed cases increased during the 2021 Olympics, Japan had several prior waves of increased case numbers, including two in 2021 (January and May). Whether the increase in confirmed cases during the Olympics can be attributed to Olympic event gatherings remains to be clarified (Supplementary Information 12).\n\nVietnam performed well in early but experienced a short-term containment performance decline in August 2020. Vietnam controlled an outbreak that emerged in February 2021 successfully. Infection growth in Vietnam has been relatively high since May 2021, and was only slightly contained until October, but then increased again in November. Transmission in late summer 2021 may reflect Delta variant invasion under low vaccination coverage (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nTaiwan is an exemplary case. COVID-19 transmission was suppressed early owing to a rapid response by Taiwan\'s Central Epidemic Command Center with cooperation from local government agencies and the public30. Taiwan suffered a case surge under low vaccine coverage in May and June 2021. The Central Epidemic Command Center responded with intensive data gathering, expansive testing, quarantines, and stringent non-pharmaceutical policies31. Faced with the highly transmissible Delta variant, Taiwan suppressed case numbers within 2 ~ 3 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 12).\n\nWhile countries seek to increase vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness has been tested by the Delta variant and breakthrough infections. In addition to vaccination, non-pharmacological interventions, such as handwashing, masking, and physical distancing, remain important for preventing transmission.\n\nPublic health implications\n\nOur research suggests that the top performing nations tend to enact rigorous health system policies and locally-appropriate lockdown measures, especially early in the pandemic (Supplementary Information 12, and Supplementary Table S11). Asian countries’ border control policies were implemented earlier than non-Asian countries. In Asian and non-Asian countries, the median times to any border closure from the first reported case in China were 24.50 and 67.50 days, respectively (P = 0.0003), and the median times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -10.50 and 8.00 days, respectively (P = 0.0027) (Supplementary Table S50, Supplementary Information 15). Notwithstanding, stringent lockdown measures should not be enacted without careful consideration, and lockdown policies should be adjusted in response to recent incidence. Flexibility in their implementation can yield containment with minimal harm to societies, economies, and mental health.\n\nLimitations\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted. First, we include unemployment rate and GDP loss, but not international aid, economic stimulus packages, or other fiscal measures. Second, Google Trends data do not represent a random sampling and may exclude vulnerable groups without internet access or those not actively searching. Third, ideally, only local infection rates should be considered to obtain precise LE measurements. However, because daily local case data are not fully available, we used incidence data inclusive of imported cases to determine LE scores. Therefore, minor inaccuracies in our LE data are expected (Supplementary Information 5).'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9317662/', 'Headline': 'The Advantages of the Zero-COVID-19 Strategy - PMC', 'Snippet': 'Introduction: To curb the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the globe have adopted either a mitigation or anelimination policy, such as the zero-COVID-19 strategy.However, further research is needed to systematically investigate the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy in the literature.

The rates of job gain in the remaining 11 areas ranged from 3.0 percent in Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD, to 1.1 percent in Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI.\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for September 2023 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, November 1, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. (ET).\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThis release presents nonfarm payroll employment estimates from the CES program. The CES survey is a Federal-State cooperative endeavor between State employment security agencies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. More information about the CES data is available in the State Employment and Unemployment Summary and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment Summary.\n\nDefinitions. Employment data refer to persons on establishment payrolls who receive pay for any part of the pay period which includes the 12th of the month. Persons are counted at their place of work rather than at their place of residence; those appearing on more than one payroll are counted on each payroll. Industries are classified on the basis of their principal activity in accordance with the 2022 version of the North American Industry Classification System.\n\nMethod of estimation. CES State and Area employment data are produced using several estimation procedures. Where possible these data are produced using a ""weighted link relative"" estimation technique in which a ratio of current-month weighted employment to that of the previous-month weighted employment is computed from a sample of establishments reporting for both months. The estimates of employment for the current month are then obtained by multiplying these ratios by the previous month\'s employment estimates. The weighted link relative technique is utilized for data series where the sample size meets certain statistical criteria. For some employment series, the estimates are produced with a model that uses direct sample estimates (described above) combined with other regressors to compensate for smaller sample sizes.\n\nAnnual revisions. Employment estimates are adjusted annually to a complete count of jobs, called benchmarks, derived principally from tax reports which are submitted by employers who are covered under state unemployment insurance (UI) laws. The benchmark information is used to adjust the monthly estimates between the new benchmark and the preceding one and also to establish the level of employment for the new benchmark month. Thus, the benchmarking process establishes the level of employment, and the sample is used to measure the month-to-month changes in the level for the subsequent months. Information on recent benchmark revisions is available in the CES State and Area benchmark article.\n\nReliability of the estimates. The estimates presented in this release are based on sample surveys, administrative data, and modeling and, thus, are subject to sampling and other types of errors. Sampling error is a measure of sampling variability—that is, variation that occurs by chance because a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed. Survey data also are subject to nonsampling errors, such as those which can be introduced into the data collection and processing operations. Estimates not directly derived from sample surveys are subject to additional errors resulting from the specific estimation processes used. The sums of individual items may not always equal totals shown in the same tables due to rounding.\n\nEmployment estimates. Changes in metropolitan area nonfarm payroll employment are cited in the analysis of this release only if they have been determined to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level. Reliability of state and area estimates for the total nonfarm employment series are available for metropolitan areas and metropolitan divisions.\n\nArea definitions. The substate area data published in this news release reflect the delineations issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on April 10, 2018. The 12 metropolitan areas discussed in this release are the metropolitan areas with the largest population according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois; Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana; and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights, IL Metropolitan Division includes Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kendall, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois.\n\nThe Elgin, IL Metropolitan Division includes DeKalb and Kane Counties.\n\nThe Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division includes Lake County in Illinois and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Gary, IN Metropolitan Division includes Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\nAdditional information\n\nEmployment data from the CES program are available on the BLS website at www.bls.gov/sae/.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.

The last time that happened in metro Chicago was February 2020, a month before the city announced its first COVID-19 death.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in metro Chicago — which includes a total of 14 counties in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — remained below 4% again in both June and July.\n\nWhile it might be premature to declare an end to the regional economic emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of pre-pandemic unemployment levels for three consecutive months is, perhaps, a sign that the worst is behind us.\n\nWBEZ analyzed more than 20 years of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Current Population Survey to get a closer look at the region’s elevated unemployment rates during the pandemic. We wanted to see how they compared with rates during earlier times of economic upheaval. Here’s what we learned.\n\nSharper spike and speedier recovery\n\nIn April 2020, metro Chicago’s unemployment rate jumped nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month to 18.72%. That’s the highest jump and the highest rate in a single month since at least 1990, the earliest date for which regional unemployment data was available on the bureau’s website.\n\nBy January 2021, the unemployment rate had dipped below 7%. By November 2021, it fell below 5%, and it dropped below 4% this May. While unemployment took more than three years to return to pre-pandemic levels, it was a shorter recovery period compared to the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe economic downturn resulting from the housing market crash is considered to have lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During that window, the rise and fall of unemployment in metro Chicago was not nearly as dramatic as during the pandemic, and the higher rates dragged on for much longer. The region’s unemployment began its slow and steady ascent in August 2006, when it was 4.45%. That rate increased each month, reaching a peak of 11.49% in January 2010 — almost 3 1⁄2 years later. The rate slowly decreased over the next few years, but it didn’t dip below 5% until January 2017.\n\nUnequal patterns among racial groups\n\nNo racial or ethnic group of workers, no age group and no gender in metro Chicago was immune to the sting of the pandemic.\n\nBut for some groups, unemployment spiked higher or lasted longer, according to a WBEZ analysis of raw data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly poll of the U.S. labor force sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOnce the rates came down, they settled into the same unequal patterns that existed before the pandemic, the analysis shows.\n\nThe estimated unemployment for Latinos in metro Chicago skyrocketed at the onset of the pandemic — growing in April 2020 from under 6% to more than 23%. It would top 20% again in both May and June of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Black nor white workers saw rates top 20%. For white workers, unemployment also jumped dramatically from less than 4% to nearly 16% in April 2020. In that month, Black unemployment rose from under 9% to nearly 17%, a smaller increase than for the other groups. Black unemployment didn’t reach its peak of nearly 19% until August 2020, according to the WBEZ analysis.\n\nHowever, overall unemployment estimates for white and Latino workers settled back to pre-pandemic rates much faster than they did for Black workers. White unemployment fell below 4% for three straight months by October 2021. Latino unemployment dipped below 6% for three consecutive months by November 2021. Unemployment for Black workers in metro Chicago didn’t drop below 9% for three consecutive months until July 2023.\n\nIn addition, for much of the past two decades, Black unemployment estimates in the region have typically remained at least twice as high as those for white unemployment. Since 2000, the average monthly unemployment estimate for Black workers in metro Chicago has been about 12.63%, which is comparable to the 13.19% average monthly unemployment estimate for white workers during the four months when it was at its peak — from April to July of 2020.\n\nSince 2000, those were the only four months when white unemployment estimates topped 10% in metro Chicago. However, for Black workers, unemployment estimates have topped that mark in 209 months since 2000.\n\nEssential workers meant lower pandemic unemployment\n\nThe surge in Latino unemployment may have been influenced by the large share of Latino workers in the restaurant and food services industry, one that was hit hard during the earliest months of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, restaurant and food services was the leading industry for Latino workers in metro Chicago. But by April 2020, unemployment for restaurant and food service workers was nearly 45%. It didn’t fall back to single digits until September 2021.\n\nIn recent months, however, the industry appears to have rebounded. Restaurant-related unemployment has been below 4% in six of the eight months between December 2022 and July 2023. And the region’s estimated number of workers in that industry topped 340,000 in July 2023, the highest such figure since June 2019.\n\nAs it might be expected in a public health crisis, unemployment for hospital workers has been much lower and far more stable. It was just 4% in April 2020. It climbed to 10% in May 2020 before falling below 7% in June 2020.\n\nThe leading industry for Black workers in 2020 was hospitals, the WBEZ analysis shows. That might have helped keep Black unemployment from growing as dramatically as it did for other groups during the first few months of the pandemic.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/news-release/2023/areaemployment_chicago_20230628.htm', 'Headline': 'Chicago Area Employment — May 2023 - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'Snippet': 'Chicago Area Employment — May 2023.

Republican members of Congress and Fox News personalities quickly repeated versions of the claim.\n\nTwo days after the Capitol was breached, the F.B.I. said there was no evidence that supporters of antifa had participated in the riot. None of the more than 729 people charged in connection to the riot so far have any connection to antifa, according to an NPR database of arrest records. Some took umbrage that antifa had received credit at all.\n\n“Don’t you dare try to tell me that people are blaming this on antifa and BLM,” one participant wrote on his Facebook page, according to charging documents. “We proudly take responsibility for storming the Castle.”\n\nStill, belief in the false theory persisted. More than 70 percent of Republicans surveyed in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll in May and more than half in a P.R.R.I. poll in September maintained that left-wing protesters were culpable for the attack.\n\nMr. Trump has continued to push the theory, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that “bad people that were not patriots at all,” including supporters of antifa, “led a lot of people astray” at the Capitol.\n\nMany have criticized the treatment of those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with some lawmakers and right-wing activists describing the arrestees as “political prisoners” or complaining of an “unequal administration of justice.” More than a third of Republicans said in a Pew poll in September that the penalties the Capitol rioters were facing were too severe.\n\nLocal officials have complained for years about the conditions at the District of Columbia jails, where dozens of the rioters have been detained in recent months, and some have raised concerns about dealing with threats from guards, standing sewage, and scant food and water.\n\nWhether the punishments doled out so far against the rioters have been overly harsh is a matter of opinion. But most of the rioters who were arrested were later released while awaiting trial. Those detained faced serious charges like assaulting police officers; they were not singled out for their political beliefs. Out of the more than 700 arrested, only about 71 people have been sentenced so far, 30 of whom have received prison time with a median sentence of 45 days, according to a Politico analysis.\n\nOthers have speculated, without evidence, that federal agents had organized the riot to entrap supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nF.B.I. agents and informants have been cited in charging documents as “a confidential source,” “a confidential human source” or simply “an informant,” or those “acting in an undercover capacity.” According to the theory, those listed as “unindicted co-conspirators” in the documents were also undercover F.B.I. agents or informants.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that two F.B.I. informants with ties to the far-right group the Proud Boys had participated in the events on Jan. 6. But that does not amount to evidence that the F.B.I. had orchestrated the attack to ensnare Trump supporters. Moreover, records show one of the informants traveled to Washington of his own volition, not at the behest of his handler.\n\nOn Twitter, Candace Owens, the right-wing news personality, has speculated, with no evidence, that “undercover FEDS” planted explosive devices at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on the day before the riot. Mr. Trump himself has toyed with the theory, noting in a December interview that the case remained unresolved and was suspicious.\n\nOfficials have yet to identify, at least publicly, or arrest the person who placed the devices. But that does not prove purposeful concealment or the F.B.I.’s involvement. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for any information that could help identify the suspect. Moreover, the F.B.I. has posted hundreds of photos and videos of individuals involved in the riot that they have yet to identify.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol resulted in injuries to about 150 federal and local police officers as well as $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol. Yet despite graphic videos depicting assaults and destruction, a chorus of prominent conservative voices have insisted that the events were largely nonviolent, akin to a “peaceful protest” or “normal tourist visit.” A year later, roughly a third of Republicans believe that the attack on the Capitol was mainly peaceful, according to several recent polls.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, compared violence at the Capitol riot to that of the racial justice protests of 2020. In several interviews on Fox News last year, he said “there were no guns whatsoever” and only one fatality during the riot compared with multiple fatalities, “plenty of guns” and “no repercussions” during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThose claims are false. At least three Jan. 6 rioters face gun charges, including a Maryland resident who took a gun into the Capitol. According to the Justice Department, over 75 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon. A bipartisan Senate report tied seven fatalities to the assault. On the day of the attack, two protesters died of heart attacks, one of an accidental overdose, and one — Ashli Babbitt — was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol through a broken glass door. A Capitol Police officer died of multiple strokes a day after the attack, and two others killed themselves in the days afterward. (Two other officers died by suicide six months later.)\n\nSeveral lawmakers have echoed Mr. Trump’s comparisons between the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nBut according to experts and data, violence was more prevalent during the Capitol breach, and the Jan. 6 rioters were more organized and intended to injure lawmakers and law enforcement at a higher rate.\n\n“One of the things we’ve learned from the Capitol arrests is that there was a small but sizable core of folks who planned what I would describe as lethal violence or attempts at lethal violence. There was no such intent in the Floyd protests,” said Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of the Prosecution Project, which tallies federal cases involving political violence.\n\nAbout 15 million to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in the summer of 2020, and the vast majority of them were peaceful. More than 17,000 people were arrested in connection to the racial justice protests, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Out of some 2,600 arrests with details about the charge or protester, 582, or about 22 percent, were charged with crimes related to violence or the threat of violence.

I’m selling it, I could make millions of dollars.” Court records show that Sullivan was paid more than $90,000 for the rights to the video.\n\nMan who shot video of fatal Capitol shooting is arrested, remains focus of political storm\n\nFederal prosecutors said Sullivan had been one of the thousands of rioters seeking to cause mayhem that day, and charged him with felony obstruction of an official proceeding, namely the confirmation of Joe Biden’s presidential win. Sullivan also faced a second felony for civil disorder and five misdemeanors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen his case landed before a jury this week, Sullivan claimed that he was simply working as a citizen journalist to document history, and all of his words and deeds indicating he was sympathetic to President Donald Trump were just a ruse to blend in with the rioters. “It’s my job to document and record history,” Sullivan testified. He said his cheers of approval for the rioters and offers to help them were merely to “say a lot of things to try and protect myself” from people he feared might turn on him if they knew his true political colors.\n\nThe jury didn’t believe him. On Thursday, after deliberating for less than four hours, they convicted Sullivan of obstructing the electoral vote count, civil disorder and five misdemeanors, and Senior U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered him held in jail until sentencing.\n\nSullivan had attended and filmed other protests, and built a large following on social media starting in the summer of 2020. But his video at the Capitol drew great notoriety in the days after the Capitol attack as conservatives like Rudy Giuliani claimed Sullivan was an “antifa” agitator who helped ignite the Jan. 6 riot, rather than Trump supporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the witness stand, Sullivan, 29, initially denied and then was forced to admit actions he took at the Capitol when confronted with video shot by himself or documentarian Jade Sacker. As Sullivan stood on the upper West Terrace, seemingly exulting in the mob’s violent approach, he was captured helping one rioter climb up to the terrace.\n\n“I don’t recall it,” he said of the footage played in court. Shown it again two days later, he admitted that there were a lot of people around him watching him. But he said it was a tactic to avoid being beaten by conservatives, who he testified had been targeting him for his online posts and for his alleged role in a Utah rally where a man was shot.\n\n“We did this s---! We took this s---!” Sullivan yelled as he walked through the Capitol with Sacker, again testifying that he was merely trying to blend in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the crowd besieged the main door to the House chamber, Sullivan can be heard saying, “Hey, guys, I have a knife, I have a knife, let me up.” Sullivan said he took a switchblade as protection, and claimed he had a knife so that he could move to the front of the crowd and “get the shot.”\n\n“He wasn’t saying these things to protect himself,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Lederer said in closing arguments. “He was saying these things to get the crowd up, to incite them.” She noted that Sullivan was recorded at one point saying to Sacker, “I’m just going to film as a ploy so I don’t get arrested.”\n\nSullivan’s lawyer, Steven R. Kiersh, pointed out that Sullivan promptly turned over his video footage to the FBI in January 2021 and never touched or threatened anyone in the Capitol. “If he’s going to commit multiple intentional felonies,” Kiersh said, “would that same person bring a camera and record that for 50 minutes?” He said Sullivan was “there with his nonviolent camera and his nonviolent tripod. His intent was to film the events of January 6.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSullivan grew up in Stafford, Va., about 45 miles from Washington, and his brother James is a conservative activist who has denounced John’s liberal politics. The split between the brothers caused Sacker to film her as-yet unaired documentary called “A House Divided.”\n\nSullivan’s parents later moved to Utah, as did Sullivan, and he began attending protests in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, shooting videos and posting them on Instagram. He said in an interview that he did not organize any protests, was not political and has never voted.\n\nBut after he was charged in July 2020 with organizing a protest in Provo, Utah, that led to a motorist being shot, he was targeted by conservatives who believed he was a Black Lives Matter activist, he said. Black Lives Matter activists in Utah said Sullivan was not part of their group and urged protesters to avoid him. Prosecutors in Utah said the protest charges were later dismissed, and Sullivan said he had not organized the rally, though he did speak at some rallies against police violence and denounced Trump at one D.C. protest, video shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSullivan said he worked feverishly to build a social media following of nearly 500,000 by posting protest-related content as “Jayden X,” and he traveled to Washington to record the action on Jan. 6 for his audience. He is seen constantly exhorting rioters to continue into and through the Capitol, and after climbing through a broken window, he eventually reaches the Speaker’s Lobby, where he yells at officers to leave “for their own safety.”\n\nThe uniformed officers do walk away, and Sullivan yells, “Go! Go! Get this s---!” When one of the glass windows to the lobby is broken, with lawmakers evacuating the House chamber, Babbitt climbs into the window and is shot dead by a Capitol Police officer, Sullivan’s video shows. Prosecutors did not show this part of the video to the jury or tell them of Sullivan’s profit from selling it. The government seized Sullivan’s bank account after he received payment from media organizations for the footage, as alleged proceeds of a criminal act, and will seek to have him forfeit it now.\n\n“We definitely believed,” juror Jon Stewart said, that Sullivan had “intent to sort of incite the riot, and perhaps his intent was different from the other protesters, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t interrupt the proceedings.” Stewart said, “There was a lot of evidence he was trying to get the crowd riled up.” He said the jury “felt there was space for a citizen journalist … but we also didn’t feel he was that.” Stewart said of Sullivan telling the crowd to “burn it down” and kicking over a metal barricade, “a journalist wouldn’t kick down the fence.”\n\nStewart said the jury planned to get together to watch Sacker’s documentary when it is released.'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/factchecking-claims-about-the-jan-6-capitol-riot/', 'Headline': 'FactChecking Claims About the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot', 'Snippet': 'House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested, without evidence, that prior to Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi played a role in denying a request to use National Guard members at the Capitol that day.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/police-chief-turned-yoga-instructor-insists-ashli-babbitt-is-not-dead-before-jan-6-judge-locks-him-up-for-more-than-a-decade/', 'Headline': ""Alan Hostetter insists Ashli Babbitt didn't die on Jan. 6 - Law & Crime"", 'Snippet': 'The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who repeatedly retweeted Lin Wood in the days and hours before her death, was caught on video.

The subpoena demanded access to all 2.1 million ballots, the machines that counted them and troves of digital election data from Maricopa County, home to the Phoenix metro area and 60% of Arizona voters.\n\nTo lead the review, Republican lawmakers hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consultancy with no experience in elections and led by a Trump supporter who shared conspiracy theories about the election on a Twitter account that he later deleted.\n\nWhat was the result of the review?\n\nThe review ended in September 2021 without producing proof to support former President Donald Trump’s claims of a stolen election.\n\nThe Cyber Ninjas report confirmed Biden’s narrow victory in Maricopa County but claimed a number of shortcomings in election procedures and suggested the final tally still could not be relied upon. Trump has repeatedly pointed to those claims in his rallies and public statements.\n\nCyber Ninjas and other contractors alleged that election computers were connected to the internet, that there were tens of thousands of potentially illegally cast ballots and that the county purged computer files that could contain evidence of fraud.\n\nWhat did Maricopa County officials say in their rebuttal?\n\nThe detailed response presented in a public meeting of the county Board of Supervisors on Jan. 5 rebutted virtually all the claims made by contractors hired by the state Senate to review its election procedures, equipment, voter registration rolls and ballot tabulation.\n\nThe report said that after ""an in-depth analysis and review of the reports and presentations issued by the Senate’s contractors, we determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.""\n\nSpecifically, Maricopa County officials say of the claims made by the various entities connected to the audit:\n\n22 were found to be misleading. ""The claims lead the reader to assume a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n41 were found to be inaccurate. ""The claims include flawed or misstated analysis,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n13 were found to be false. ""The claims are demonstrably false and can be proven false using materials provided to the Senate,"" a portion of the statement read.\n\n""If you are biased or not using an objective process, you’re likely to come to a faulty conclusion,"" said Scott Jarrett, director of the county Elections Department.\n\nDid the county find issues when they analyzed the State Senate report?\n\nThe county experts did find some issues when they analyzed claims in the Senate report. The county review validated only a handful of the 33,000 ballots that the Senate report said could have been illegally cast because voters had moved prior to the election.\n\nFive voters were identified as having voted in more than one county, and six people may have voted twice in Maricopa County. The county report also found 27 cases where ballots were counted that were cast by people who died before they were returned in the mail; those were referred to the state attorney general for more investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThe county is reviewing another 100 cases involving people who died close to the election but still cast ballots. The Senate report had identified 298 voters who had potentially cast a ballot but died before the election.\n\nIn all, the county found 38 instances were a ballot may have been illegally cast, and all have been sent to the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe county report also said that election workers had inadvertently double counted a batch of 50 ballots.\n\nCould the findings affect the 2020 election results?\n\nThe number of vote counting errors and potential illegal votes would not have affected the outcome of the election. President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by about 45,000 votes, key to his 10,500-vote win of Arizona. Previous reviews of the 2.1 million county ballots by nonpartisan professionals that followed state law have found no significant problem with the vote count in the county, which includes metro Phoenix.\n\nDid the county conduct its own audit?\n\nYes, according to officials.\n\n""After the November 2020 General Election, the County hired two federally certified Voting System Test Laboratories to conduct an audit of the tabulation equipment used to count ballots for all five of the elections administered in 2020,"" read a portion of the report.\n\nAccording to the report, both labs found no anomalies in the tabulation equipment. They also found that:\n\nCertified software were used for all tested software, systems and equipment\n\nNo malware or malicious hardware were installed\n\nNo evidence of internet connectivity was found\n\nOne of the two labs also found the 2020 General Election program and tabulation equipment was accurate, according to county officials. The test was only done by one of that two labs.\n\nWhere can the report be found?\n\nThe report has been uploaded to the Maricopa County Recorder\'s Office website, and can be read here.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally Jan. 15 outside Florence, his second in Arizona since his election loss.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) contributed to this report.\n\nContinued Coverage\n\nLawyer for Arizona Senate election audit firm wants to quit\n\nFar too little vote fraud to tip 2020 election to Trump, AP review finds\n\nArizona Senate can\'t claim legislative privilege for 2020 election audit records, judge rules\n\nCourt rejects another request to keep Arizona audit public records private\n\nTune in to FOX 10 Phoenix for the latest news'}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/04/07/arizona-election-fraud-finally-uncovered-mark-brnovich-investigation/9501380002/', 'Headline': ""Finally, Arizona's election fraud has been found! - azcentral.com"", 'Snippet': '“BREAKING NEWS: Arizona Audit w/ @KelliWardAZ.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan.\n\nThe US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report last month that stated the US intelligence community could not determine whether researchers at the lab who fell ill in the fall of 2019 were infected with Covid-19, but identified safety and security issues at the lab. Many other experts say evidence suggests that the coronavirus likely emerged naturally and spread to humans in a Wuhan seafood market.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health notified EcoHealth Alliance – a US-based organization that received a 2014 grant from NIH that was partly funneled to the Wuhan Institute – in April 2020 that it was reviewing allegations linking the Wuhan Institute to the coronavirus pandemic. And in July of that year, NIH told EcoHealth it had received reports of “biosafety concerns” at the lab.\n\nCollaboration between the organization and Chinese scientists came alongside broader efforts by American scientists to engage with researchers around the world to better understand animal viruses in their regions that could pose a risk to humans.\n\nResearchers at the institute studied bat coronaviruses, but have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nInstead, they have pointed to their contributions to understanding the virus, which included publishing information in early 2020 identifying what was at that point the closest known relative virus to the one that causes Covid-19.\n\nChina has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all hypotheses for how the virus emerged – hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak’s origin.\n\nThe World Health Organization has repeatedly called for further investigation in the country, including a laboratory audit and studies that could turn up evidence for the natural emergence of the virus.\n\nBeijing has defended its transparency and decried what it sees as US-led “politicizing” of the issue, while trying to point the finger away from itself.\n\nChinese officials have suggested the virus didn’t emerge within the country’s borders and called on the US to audit its own laboratories, without providing clear reasoning for why this would be necessary.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106119', 'Headline': 'Federal Research: NIH Could Take Additional Actions to Manage Risks ...', 'Snippet': 'Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency.

Such collaborations can lead to scientific advancements, but there are concerns about certain countries exploiting this research to harm the U.S.\n\nWe reviewed federal funds that agencies directly or indirectly awarded to 3 Chinese research institutions. Most of the money came from awards funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nNIH's oversight didn't always ensure that foreign institutions complied with award terms and conditions—which can include biosafety requirements.\n\nWe recommended improving oversight of such awards.\n\nWhat GAO Found\n\nAll three of the selected Chinese entities GAO was asked to provide information on, received research funds in calendar years 2014 through 2021, whether directly through a federal award or indirectly through subawards to carry out part of the work of a federal award. Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $200,000 in grant funding to Wuhan University, the only selected Chinese entity to receive funding directly from a federal agency. However, all three selected entities collectively received seven subawards, totaling over $2 million, from federal award recipients or a first-tier subrecipient (see figure).\n\nAwards and Subawards Identified to Three Selected Chinese Entities, Calendar Years 2014-2021\n\nNote: The figure may not reflect all funding to the selected entities in the time period reviewed due, in part, to limitations in federal reporting requirements.\n\nFederal agencies and award recipients described efforts to assess risks, but gaps exist in NIH's risk assessment efforts. In January 2023, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommended that NIH implement enhanced monitoring, documentation, and reporting requirements for award recipients with foreign subrecipients. To address this recommendation, NIH noted it may need additional authorities and plans to explore government-wide practices, which will take time. However, federal internal controls require that agencies take timely corrective actions to address risks. While NIH pursues long-term actions for award recipients, it has not conducted its own near-term assessments, which could enhance its internal oversight.\n\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n\nFederal agencies sometimes provide funds to foreign entities, such as universities and laboratories, for research or other purposes. Such collaborations can benefit agency missions and lead to advancements in areas such as public health. At the same time, Congress, the White House, and others have expressed concerns about entities from countries, such as China, exploiting U.S. funded research in ways that could harm U.S. national security or economic competitiveness.\n\nGAO was asked to provide information on federal funds disbursed to three selected Chinese entities—Wuhan University; the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nThis report examines, among other things, the amount of federal funding GAO identified that was provided to the three selected Chinese entities in calendar years 2014 through 2021 and steps agencies and award recipients have taken to assess risks.\n\nGAO searched USAspending.gov and other federal databases and reviewed award agreements, progress reports, payment information, and other documents from federal agencies and U.S.-based award recipients. GAO also interviewed federal officials and the U.S. award recipients.""}, 3: {'URL': 'https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-suspends-federal-funding-wuhan-lab-over-non-compliance-2023-07-19/', 'Headline': 'US suspends federal funding to Wuhan lab over non-compliance', 'Snippet': 'WIV has not received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. medical research agency, since July 2020, according to an HHS statement on Wednesday.'}, 4: {'URL': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01930-0', 'Headline': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake ... - Nature', 'Snippet': 'NIH to intensify scrutiny of foreign grant recipients in wake of COVID origins debate.

A vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and a fully vaccinated person has received either a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.\n\nMany countries started to administer additional doses toward the end of 2021 after research found that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. More than 2.72 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide. Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the manufacturers of two of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccinations, have developed updated vaccines that more effectively protect against the newer Omicron variant. These are currently being administered in many countries, including the United States and Britain.\n\nVaccination rates around the world have stagnated in recent months, with public demand dropping even as vaccine supply has become more abundant.\n\nEarly leads in vaccination rates have become entrenched. Africa has the lowest vaccination rate of any continent, with just 37.2 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 82.3 percent in Latin America.\n\nMore than two-dozen different vaccines have been used worldwide, according to data from Our World in Data.'}, 2: {'URL': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105', 'Headline': 'Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country', 'Snippet': 'BBC News.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.\n\nSeparate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.\n\nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs.\n\nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data, external - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\n\nAccording to that data, external, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.\n\nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.\n\nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people.\n\nDaily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.\n\nNorth Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic ""fever cases"" according to the state news agency.\n\nChina appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai.
