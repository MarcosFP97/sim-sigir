Omicron has now replaced prior variants globally and has been the dominant variant circulating for over 1 year, albeit with several emerging sub-variants9. Two Omicron-specific bivalent vaccines, that include antigens representing both the ancestral Wuhan virus and Omicron subtypes, are now available10.

         First paragraph of the first search result: "The literature search yielded 6,575 papers, and based on review of their titles and abstracts, 87 were selected for inclusion (Additional file 1: Appendix C). Eight of the 87 presented results from more than one transmission setting, location, or TaT approach, and these were subdivided into 96 separate studies. Of these, there were 72 empirical research studies and 24 modelling studies (Fig. 1). Empirical research studies were of MTaT (n = 25) or FTaT (n = 47). Almost all MTaT studies were proactive, except for one reactive study [14]. All FTaT studies were reactive, referred to as RACD, and targeted geographic areas at the sub-village level and/or individuals based on socio-demographic risk factors. Some MTaT studies also included TTaT but here were no empirical research studies of TTaT alone. Of the 12 intervention studies, 10 focused on MTaT and 2 on RACD; all other studies were observational (Fig. 1). The first study was published in 2005 and the annual number of papers increased since 2014 (Additional file 1: Appendix D). Most studies were from sites with lower transmission in sub-Saharan Africa or the Asia Pacific region, with Plasmodium falciparum as the predominant species. Eight studies used molecular testing to inform treatment (Fig. 2)."

         First paragraph of the second search result:"WASHINGTON — The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic held a hearing titled “Investigating the Proximal Origin of a Cover Up” to examine the potential conflicts of interest and suppression of scientific discourse by the National Institutes of Health surrounding the drafting, publication, and critical reception of the infamous “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2” (Proximal Origin) correspondence. Select Subcommittee members asked Dr. Kristian Andersen and Dr. Robert Garry — co-authors of Proximal Origin — about their effort to skew scientific evidence to fulfill Dr. Fauci’s vision of a single narrative in support of a natural COVID-19 origin. Drs. Andersen and Garry testified to the political motivations for suppressing the lab leak hypothesis and detailed the lack of science available to support their declared conclusions. Members also questioned the witnesses about their inclination to protect the Chinese government and demanded accountability for the apparent disregard of the scientific process while drafting the paper. Information gained from this hearing will help the Select Subcommittee conduct further investigations into the unforced errors by the NIH during the COVID-19 pandemic — specifically the role Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins played in squashing scientific discourse during the pandemic."

Select Subcommittee members asked Dr. Kristian Andersen and Dr. Robert Garry — co-authors of Proximal Origin — about their effort to skew scientific evidence to fulfill Dr. Fauci’s vision of a single narrative in support of a natural COVID-19 origin. Drs. Andersen and Garry testified to the political motivations for suppressing the lab leak hypothesis and detailed the lack of science available to support their declared conclusions. Members also questioned the witnesses about their inclination to protect the Chinese government and demanded accountability for the apparent disregard of the scientific process while drafting the paper.

Despite several vaccines showing high initial efficacy against infection with the ancestral virus, the sequential emergence of variants of concern has substantially reduced the effectiveness of vaccines in blocking infection and onward transmission, although efficacy against severe outcomes has been more durable4,5,6. The emergence and global spread of the Omicron variant and its subtypes has resulted in repeated infection due to waning and reduced effectiveness of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity7,8. Omicron has now replaced prior variants globally and has been the dominant variant circulating for over 1 year, albeit with several emerging sub-variants9. Two Omicron-specific bivalent vaccines, that include antigens representing both the ancestral Wuhan virus and Omicron subtypes, are now available10. These have demonstrated higher immunogenicity against the Omicron BA.1 subvariant and against the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants than the ancestral vaccines11,12."

Title: "Lockdowns saved lives, but not a go-to strategy moving forward" Snippet: "A new University of Michigan-led study shows the lockdowns implemented in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic saved lives — but the decision to use lockdowns is much more nuanced and the research shouldn’t be used to justify lockdowns now or to retroactively endorse that approach, said health economist Olga Yakusheva, associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing."

         First paragraph of the first search result: "“Do your own research” is a popular tagline among fringe groups and ideological extremists. Noted conspiracy theorist Milton William Cooper first ushered this rallying cry into the mainstream in the 1990s through his radio show, where he discussed schemes involving things such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an Illuminati cabal and alien life. Cooper died in 2001, but his legacy lives on. Radio host Alex Jones’s fans, anti-vaccine activists and disciples of QAnon’s convoluted alternate reality often implore skeptics to do their own research."
         First paragraph of the second search result:"The theory of data voids suggests that, when individuals search online about misinformation, especially misinformation around breaking or recently published news, search engines may return little credible information, instead placing non-credible information at the top of results20. These data voids likely exist for a variety of reasons. Low-quality publishers have been found to use search engine optimization techniques and encourage readers to use specific search queries when searching online by consistently using distinct phrases in their stories and in other media20. These terms can guide users to data voids on search engines, where only one point of an unreliable view is represented. Low-quality news sources also often re-use stories from each other, polluting search engine results with other similar non-credible stories. It was previously argued (page 75 of ref. 30) that the media dynamics in the United States (particularly on the right) “tend to reinforce partisan statements, irrespective of their truth”. Tripodi31 shows how Google’s search algorithms interact with conservative elite messaging strategies to push audiences towards extreme and, at times, false views. This ‘propaganda feedback loop’ creates a network of outlets reporting the same misinformation and therefore can flood search engine results with false but seemingly corroborating information. The topics and framing of false/misleading news stories are also often distinct from those covered by mainstream outlets, which could limit the amount of reliable news sources being returned by search engines when searching for information about these stories. Finally, direct fact-checks may be difficult to find given that most false narratives are never fact-checked at all and, for stories that are evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact, these fact-checks may not be posted in the immediate aftermath of a false article’s publication. As a result, it would not be surprising that exposure to unreliable news is particularly prevalent when searching online about recently published misinformation."

         First paragraph of the first search result: "The side effects of COVID-19 on public health are well known, especially if the necessary measures for social distancing are not taken to control transmission. Strict and compulsory social distancing restrictions have considerable effects on the economy, education, freedom of the people, and societies’ physical and mental health [1,2,3]. Therefore, the most desirable way to control the epidemic, which provides long-term protection against the outbreak of COVID-19, is to develop and distribute an effective and safe vaccine [4, 5]. With the rapid growth of vaccine research and entering the different types of vaccines into the third phase of clinical research and the issuance of emergency licenses for their global use, various ethical challenges have been raised, which are generally based on the four principles of bioethics: justice, non-maleficence, benefit, and autonomy [6]. These challenges can be classified into four general categories, including (1) safe and standard manufacturing and passing scientific and ethical stages, (2) evaluation and monitoring of safety and efficacy, (3) mass production, fair distribution, and (4) public acceptance [7]. Justice is a fair adjudication consisting of distributive justice, rights-based justice, and legal justice. Distributive justice means equal distribution of scarce resources among all; equality means the absence of avoidable or compensable disparities between different groups, countries, ethnicities and races, and societies in general [6, 8]. The principle of beneficence states that COVID-19 vaccines perform to benefit individuals and increase their well-being. Autonomy in health care gives the patient the right to make decisions regarding their health care independently based on their beliefs, attitudes, and judgments. The principle of non-maleficence or to do no harm means “not harming” the fundamental and vital principles in health care and research [8, 9]. In the past, vaccines have always been developed through a series of steps that may take years. At present, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, Human Challenge Trials (HCTs) are a potential way to accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments [10, 11]. Clinical trials raise several ethical issues, including human trials, placebo use, patent, participants’ consent, considerations for children and pregnant women, the right to post-trial access for the control group, access to affordable, safe, and effective vaccines that should be considered in the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines [12]."

         First paragraph of the second search result:"From the beginning, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not only had a devastating impact on public health, but also has engendered staggeringly numerous and diverse socio-political responses. Healthcare systems were overwhelmed with treating COVID-19 patients along with their regular patient load not only because of the deadliness of the disease, but in no small part due to insufficient availability of resources (e.g. hospital beds, healthcare professionals), especially intensive care units. Unprecedented disruptions to the global economy occurred not only because of a labor force mowed down by the severity of the disease, but also because of policies that, in seeking to restrict its spread, also impeded labor practices and supply chains from the local to the global level. Governments clearly play an important role in shaping the evolution of the pandemic, as they have the prerogative to direct medical, social or economic resources. But governments worldwide initially were forced to make monumental decisions in an information-poor environment. Relying on data from previous epidemics could only be of superficial help given qualitative differences in historical periods as well as the differences in virus characteristics. And, because of the rapidity with which the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, it was especially difficult for governments and policymakers to define “data-driven” strategies for public policy-making. Thanks to the extraordinary efforts carried on worldwide to collect data on the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now possible and of paramount importance to learn from this newly available data in order to contain the effects of the current and future pandemics. To illustrate the powerful potential of such evidence-based public policy-making when the requisite data can be gathered, we present in this article a rigorous analysis of the relationship between government policies and COVID-19 health outcomes, using a trove of new data on government policies (summarised in Policy Intensity Indices) and indicators that describe the evolution of the pandemic throughout the year 2020. To do so, we estimate models that can account for potential endogeneity in this relationship since theoretically, epidemiological variables can not only affect the decisions of policymakers, but government policy can also clearly—either positively or negatively—affect the evolution of the pandemic itself."
